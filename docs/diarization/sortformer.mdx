## Overview

Sortformer is NVIDIA's end-to-end streaming speaker diarization model, converted to CoreML. Unlike the pyannote pipeline (segmentation + clustering), Sortformer is a single neural network with 4 fixed speaker slots.

Model: [FluidInference/diar-streaming-sortformer-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/diar-streaming-sortformer-coreml)

## Key Properties

- 4 fixed speaker slots with real-time inference
- No separate segmentation + clustering stages
- Streaming only (no offline mode)
- Best for scenarios with 4 or fewer speakers

## When to Use Sortformer vs Pyannote

Sortformer can beat pyannote on benchmarks with certain configs, but benchmark DER does not always reflect production performance. In practice:

| Scenario | Recommendation | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Noisy / background noise | **Sortformer** | More robust to non-speech audio |
| 4 or fewer speakers | **Sortformer** | Designed for this — single model, no clustering |
| 5+ speakers | **Pyannote offline** | Sortformer only has 4 speaker slots, will miss speakers |
| Overlapping speech (5+ people) | **Pyannote offline** | Sortformer breaks down with heavy crosstalk beyond 4 |
| Best overall accuracy | **Pyannote offline** | 15% DER vs 32% — more consistent in production |
| Streaming required, simple meetings | **Sortformer** | Single model, no clustering overhead |

<Warning>
Benchmarks are not always consistent with production usage. Pyannote's offline pipeline with aggressive tuning can score lower DER on AMI, but those configs may not generalize. Sortformer's 32% DER is more representative of real-world performance on meetings with 4 or fewer speakers.
</Warning>

## Benchmarks

[AMI SDM](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/) (16 meetings, single distant microphone). Audio length: 30.4s chunks (NVIDIA high-latency config):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average DER | 31.7% |
| Average Miss | 21.5% |
| Average FA | 0.5% |
| Average SE | 9.7% |
| Average RTFx | 126.7x |

See [full benchmarks](/reference/benchmarks) for per-meeting breakdown.
