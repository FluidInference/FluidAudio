## Common Code Patterns

### 1. Error Handling
```swift
enum DiarizerError: Error {
    case modelLoadingFailed(String)
    case audioProcessingFailed(String)
    case invalidConfiguration(String)
}
```

### 2. Configuration Objects
```swift
struct DiarizerConfig {
    let clusteringThreshold: Double = 0.7
    let minDurationOn: Double = 1.0
    let minDurationOff: Double = 0.5
    let minActivityThreshold: Double = 10.0
}
```

### 3. Async Processing
```swift
func processAudio(url: URL) async throws -> DiarizationResult {
    // Async audio processing pipeline
}
```

### 4. CoreML Model Handling
```swift
private func loadModel() throws -> MLModel {
    // Model loading with auto-recovery mechanism
}
```

## Development Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
swift build                    # Build the project
swift test                     # Run unit tests
swift build -c release        # Release build
```
