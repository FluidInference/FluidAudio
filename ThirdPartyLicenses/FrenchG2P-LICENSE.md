# French text frontend (Kokoro ANE `.french`)

The French frontend looks words up in the `fr_FR` list of ipa-dict
(https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict), redistributed as
`ANE/assets/fr_lexicon.tsv` on `FluidInference/kokoro-82m-coreml` (lowercase
keys, first listed pronunciation, multi-word entries dropped). Words missing
from it go through CharsiuG2P (https://github.com/lingjzhu/CharsiuG2P, MIT),
already shipped as `MultilingualG2PEncoder/Decoder.mlmodelc`.
