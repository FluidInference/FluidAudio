      "baseline" : "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for waiting. I'm Margarita Chung from IR and we would like to welcome everyone to Tampa Energia's third quarter twenty twenty one Bitcoin video conference. We inform you that this event is being recorded, all participants will be in listen-only mode during the presentation. After the company's remarks, there will be a QA session. Questions can only be submitted in writing so soon. Should any participant need assistance, please send us a chat message or email. Before proceeding, please read the disclaimer that is located on the second page of our presentation. Let me mention that forward-looking statements are based on Pampa Energias Management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions because they are related to future events that may or may not occur. Investors should understand that that general economic conditions and industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of campergia and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn the video conference over to Gustavo Mariani over CFO. Sorry. Hello everybody and thank you for joining our conference call. Uh in case in case uh you miss you miss the news. Uh uh uh sorry about that. In case uh you miss the the news. Gabby Cohen after sharing eighteen years with us decided to step down from his CFO position. Uh fortunately he will remain as a member of our board of directors, so uh we will continue taking advantage of his wisdom and and and expertise. Um Gabby's well learned uh trust and respect from the investor community has allowed Pampa uh to become what the company that it is today so uh our appreciation is tough to uh to to say in in a in a few words. Um Gabby, thank you very much for all you have done uh for for the company. Um yesterday the board of directors accepted uh Gabby's resignation and uh appointed uh Nicolas Mindri, who is uh sitting at my right, as the as our new uh CFO. Uh Nico is an industrial engineer. Uh he has been leading the M and A division of Pampa for eight years already. He has played a key role in the acquisition of Cesoblas Argentina, a significant milestone for for our company, and since then has been focusing t uh among other things in reorganizing the the portfolio of asset uh to focus in the core business that that we have today. Nico uh together with Gabby's team um has all that is necessary to uh to succeed in in his role so we wish him um good luck in the in his new endeavor. Okay. Thank you Gustavo for your support. So good morning everyone and thank you for joining. I'm very excited sorry I'm very excited to to end this new chapter of my professional career in Pampa. I have been working uh in Pampa along Gustavo, Gabi and all of Pampa's team and partner for the last eight years. Gabi has done an excellent job in on the financial front. He has put together an excellent team. So the idea is to continue on the same path. So now that travels and conferences are slowly resuming. I can't wait to meet all of Pampa's investors in person soon. So now I will pass to Lida, who will briefly comment on the quarter highlights and then later we will open to the QA. Thank you Nico. Nico Hello everyone. In the interest of time I will summarize the latest events and financial figures for more details. You can check our earnings release or feel free to contact us. On Quarters Highlights, our EMP business achieved all time high production of almost three hundred and thirty million QE feet per day in September, as you can see in the graph. Also, we recorded the highest single day output at three hundred and fifty million Q feet per day, precisely on september. fifteenth The recovery of demand, exports and plant gas have been the main contributors for this growth. Moreover, this month we participated in the first round of Landas, a take or pay option to fill the remaining idle capacity at Ukina Bassi. The tender we tender and got awarded twenty one million QVC per day, twoirds-th of the total tender volume, committing to deliver from May twenty twenty-two until December twenty twenty-four at three dollars three thirty-five dollars per m BTU. Therefore, the following winter we should be producing a new all-time high of 400 million cc per day, building an annual average price of $3.6 per mBTU. We highlight that Pampa is the only producer delivering the most significant gas increase compared to the winter of twenty twenty. In power generation, we are moving on with the PP3s, PP three Wind Fund Expansion project by doubling its capacity to reach a total of a hundred and six megawatts. We estimate roughly eighty million dollars of investment that will allow us to keep increasing our clean energy portfolio and strengthening our position in the business-to-business market. In Q3, we achieve a substantial leverage reduction. Our net debt decreased by one hundred and twenty five million dollars in a single quarter. Year today we have accumulated two hundred and thirty million dollars of net leverage reduction. Finally, we just wanted to let you know that we released a twenty twenty our twenty twenty sustainability report, audited for the first time. We show material improvements in water, consumption, energy consumption, carbon footprint intensities, in line with the previous year's efforts to invest in efficient power technology and focus on gas. We seek transparency to share our ESG performance with our stakeholders, and your opinion is always welcome. Now let's move on to the quarter's financial KPIs. Revenues increase forty-nine percent year on year to five hundred seventy-seven million dollars in the quarter, mainly driven by plant gas boosted by the winter season, demand recovery and commodities price hikes. All of them were partially offset by certain power plant outages and tariff frees in our utility businesses. In Q3, over eighty five percent of our sales and AEVA were dollar leak. The adjusted E VA amounted to two hundred sixty two million dollars, twenty seven% year on year due to uh the same reasons we telled before, offset by higher EMP IT. Quarter on quarter, ABDA increased by nine percent, maybe due to the seasonality and higher. Thanks to the strong investments and production growth, oil and gas is balancing back its C VPA share for the first time in three years. CapEx almost doubled year on year in Q three, but uh remains similar quarter of border, mainly because of the plant gas and barragans expansion observed by the commissioning of Genelba's second CCGT back in July of twenty twenty. Moving on to power generation, as seen in slide seven, we posted an adjusted EDA of $126 million in Q3, slightly lower year on year, mainly due to the outages that we said before and the N of P Kirendas ten year CPA, offset by higher V two V cells and higher thermal dispatch, especially at Loma. In the legacy units, the twenty-nine percent pest salt they received last February was diluted by the inflation. The evaluation side. Quarter on quarter, ABDA increased marginally due to the better B2B cells and seasonality upset by the retroactive spot price update. A spot energy is fifty nine percent of our capacity but only represented twenty four percent of our power generation UVDA, which will keep shrinking unless the condition of prior adjustments keep up with the evaluation. As these essential units to the grid continue being on the pace, it will be challenging to maintain them properly. However, recently the government approved a price improvement for thermal legacy units, especially those with low low factor, set improvement is temporary, payable between September and May, and linked with the electricity exports made by Canada. Moving to Pampas operating figures, power generation in Q free was thirty percent up year on year, surpassing nationwide demand. We recorded higher C C T dispatch a Loma and General No. one C C C T due to the better gas supply plus increased thermal dispatch with alternative fuels, offset by the plus units voltages and low water input at PCPCOM 24. Quarter on quarter the output rose eighteen percent, driven by seasonality, but upset by the aforementioned voltages. The The power generation business model relies on capacity payment, so the most important is to keep the availability as high as possible, especially for PPAs. The availability availability rate in Q3 reached ninety five percent, slightly lower year on year, mainly due to UILES and Energia Plus units partial outages. Reling our expansions, the closing to CGT at Ensenaba Ragan is more than 50% advanced. We continue working on the steam toil line, cooling tower, boilers, and diverters. Also we are finishing the cellar works and commissioning the high voltage fuel. Around seventeen hundred people work in two ships with all the COVID protocols in place to achieve facility by th second quarter of twenty twenty two. Moving to the EMP, we posted an adjusted EPA of one hundred and four million dollars in Q free, a remarkable growth year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by climb gas, winter season and demand recovery, offset by more royalties and resumption of activity. Our total lifting cost increased thirty six percent year on year and twenty six percent quar on quarter, explained by higher production output. However, lifting costs per unit stood at six dollars per BoE, eleven percent more than last year, but similar to Q2. This is mainly thanks to El Mangru's high productivity. Our global production increased twenty three percent year on year and twenty percent quarter on quarter. Again, mainly driven by Trangas winter and the local old demand recovery to pre pandemic levels. As a result, we average more than fifty seven thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which ninety two percent is gas. On the other side, which represented twenty-three percent of the segment's revenue in the quarter, volume sold increased by forty percent year on year and thirty-one percent quarter on quarter to five point nine thousand barrels per day. Mainly explained by the local demand, upset by lower exports. And oil price driven by the rent was fifty percent increased compared to the last year, but remain similar quarter on quarter. Regarding gas, as showing the slide ten, our volumes will average uh three hundred and twenty six million cubic feet per day in the quarter, roughly twenty five percent up uh read year on year and quarter on quarter for the reasons it's going be before. Going back to our production performance, as I say before, we reach an all-time high record in September. Again, El Mangruscio led the quarters growth, contributing close to 70% of our overall gas. This block is wholly owned and operated by us with outstanding productivity boosted by the increased shipment capacity. Our live average price of the quarter was four point four dollars per mu BTU, seventy six percent up year on year and forty uh fourteen percent increase quarter on quarter. Again, explained by the Plan Gas in their peak. The B2B and spot prices out of this GSA also reflected the seasonality similar to Plant Gas pricing levels. As you can see right below, the year-to-day sales were are more diversified, similar to the country's breakdown. Gas retailers are also part of the twin gas and they have priorities in the winter, increasing their share to thirty nine percent. Also we are growing, as you can see, our B2B share. Regarding our EMP operations update, we strengthened our investment by recording fifty two million dollars during the quarter while it was marginal last year. This quarter we reeled eight tight gas wells, also we completed sixteen wells, of which fifteen are tight, and one is shell from Sierra Chata, a block that reached the maximum production rate of twenty eight million K C per day, becoming one of the most productive gas wells in Bacamorta. Also, as I said in the previous call, we are expanding the gas treatment planet in Mangruo, reaching about three hundred and ten million CV feet per day by the first half of next year. In oil, we drilled thirteen wells and completed ten at the Governador Ayala and el Torvish. Moving to the petrochemical business, we posted an adjusted EDA of seven million dollars in the Q Free, similar year on year, the higher raw material costs and plant gas, in fact, compensated for the significant rise in commodity prices and industrial demand recovery. Quote on quarter, the APDA have driven by higher raw material costs offset by increased sales of reforming products. The year on year and quote unquote total cells volume increase was significant, especially in reforming products. In addition, roughly fifty percent of the quarter cells were exported. About cash and debt, though we are raising our capex to accommodate and gas commitments, we must highlight another quarter week solid cash flow position uh generation, driven by the outstanding operating performance from our core businesses and improved margins in the upstream. During Q free, the free cash flow resulted in roughly a hundred and eight million dollars million dollars. In comparison, last year's quarter represented a sixty eight million dollars also due to the higher working capital. Notice that this quarter, working capital and others were positive, most displaying by improved collections from Clamesa as shown in slide thirteen. Delays have to twenty three days compared to the maximum forty six days achieved in Q one of this year. In addition, we repaid a net of sixty million dollars of principal debt and bought back shares for three million dollars. So in total we generated forty four million dollars of net cash, achieving five hundred and seven five hundred and oh seven million dollars of cash position by the end of the quarter. Moving on to the slide fourteen. This slide shows consolidated figures cons including our affiliate ownership, but let's focus only on the restricted group that reflects the bomb perimeters. As we began the call, our balance sheet keeps strengthening despite the context. We continue to reduce the cross step, having cancelled most of the test maturities through the quarter for sixty five million dollars, posting one point five million dollars as of September twenty twenty one. Almost a hundred percent of the debt is denominating dollars, up from the ninety six percent in June. The dollar debt bears an average interest rate of seven point eight percent. The average life remains similar at four point seven years. I' saidve before, cash increased ten percent quarter unquarter to five hundred and seven million million dollars. Therefore, net debt decreased by one hundred and twenty five million dollars to nine hundred seventeen million dollars are a remarkable reduction just in a single quarter. Given the lower debt and higher VDA, the net leverage ratio are improved from one point seven to one point four times quarter on quarter. In the next twelve months, the company faces less than twenty million dollars of maturities. Therefore, we expect to keep strengthening our balance sheet. As a result, SMP upgraded our standalone rating to B minus. So this concludes our presentation and before uh we would like to open the QA session. Mai Yes, thank you for uh thank you for uh waiting. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please send up through the Zoom chat. We will read and answer them in the order received. Also ple,ase make sure your name and company are adequately displayed to introduce you to the audience. Please lower your hand once your question is answered. Should any participant need assistance, send a chat message or break your hand. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Fred McCann from Bank of America. How much additional upside do you see in Gas over the next few years? To what extent could this be held or limited by transportation capacity? Hi Frank and thank you for uh joining us in in the call. Um we believe that uh uh that the um transportation capacity going out from the Neukina basin will be uh almost uh completely full next next winter. So uh as we have been saying we we talk about this in the previous conference call, i it is crucial for the country to increase uh its infrastructure, its transportation capacity uh from the Pina Basin to to Buenos Aires or to the centre of the country. Uh and the government is fortunately working on on on on that project. We hope it will be uh launched soon. But we have no uh clarity on when uh will that happen. But definitely the country um in order to continue increasing the gas production at the Neuquinia basin, um there is a need to build uh new infrastructure uh new infrastructure. And this makes a lot of sense for the country because with this new pipeline, the country will be replacing uh extensive imports that we do uh gas from Bolivia that cost around double from uh what the local producers producers are uh are receiving. Um we will uh import less L and G which cost at least uh four or five times uh more expensive and we are also importing uh during the winter um diesel oil and and fuel oil. So n needing for all these imports um dollars that are scary scarce in So um regarding the additional lab sites for for a company like us, uh until this new pipeline uh it's uh constructed it it could come from exports to to Chile and now that the transportation capacity out of the Nokina basin is completely full uh it makes sense to allow uh firm exports uh to Chile um on a on a the on a um not only on on the summer months but throughout the uh the year. I I think that that will be the next step of of growth uh for the industry. So and and going to to numbers, uh because of what we have committed on the on the third round, uh our growth on winter of twenty twenty two Pisa B this winter will be roughly about thirty percent. So next winter we will be delivering eleven millions of cubic meters of natural gas per day starting in May. Uh V is an average of eight point five million cubic meters of of gas per day that we deliver this winter. This winter we have been uh ramping up started uh starting uh at seven and ended in September at nine point five. Unfortunately uh originally we were thinking that uh our production was going to slow down during the summer months, but thanks to uh the exports of electricity that the country is doing to to Brazil, We are able to maintain the the production. So we we currently are uh selling the same level that we of gas that we sold during the winter and we are keeping a plateau of nine point nine point three, nine point five million cubic meters of uh gas per day. And we think this uh situation um will stay throughout the the summer and probably until next May when our the our production will jump again to uh eleven million. Thank you, Rules. Our next question comes from Ezequiel Fernandez from Balias. His first question is about uh results were great on the oil and gas side, um, but lifting costs have been increasing as of late. At six dollar per barrel uh per barrel, this is almost one dollar per barrel versus one year ago. Is this related to the production rumpo? Perhaps cost surges related to global supply chain? How should we think about this going forward? There is a second question, but let's answer the first one. Hi, Ezekiel, how are you? So basically yes, it's uh it's an important increase in our production, that's why there's more fixed costs. And also we uh this is the first year of the Pung gas, so it's uh and and last year we did nothing. It was totally uh no activity compared to this year. And then there's uh a lot of increases in in salaries and wages. So in real terms in dollars it's a an increase. And the second question is very related to the first one. Also, are you perceiving cost increases on grips and drilling equipment that you should be using next year, or are you already constructive for that? We uh uh we we are already contracted and we've seen a slight increase uh uh in cost, but nothing out of normal. Thank you. Thank you, Rules. Uh our next question comes from Alejandra Aranda from Itahu. It's very related to the first question of Frank. Could you give us an update of what you're seeing in the gas market and bottlenecks to further develop the segment and timing of next plan gas rounds or further alternatives that you could explore to continue increasing volumes or should we view the eleven millimeters per day on winter at steady state for the near future? Could you share development costs and what IRR cost are you using for a for new projects. Well mm, well it's uh it's that's uh we should be viewing it it depends. I wef get um the the new pipeline, the new main pipeline that the the government is pushing a lot to to make it happen. We could see by twenty twenty three I always say twenty twenty four, given the timing of of building, but uh a a better and higher winter production uh by twenty twenty four. You see you saw in the in the presentation we expects to get eleven million by twenty twenty two, but in order to increase on that we are still link depends on the expansion in the main pipeline. What do you think about that, Gustavo, about the bottom eggs? The reason why we were so aggressive in this third round is is because we we under two things. But one is that we understand that uh until the the new pipeline is working, the the gas market from the Leukina basin will be very much constrained. That's why we wanted to be uh aggressive uh here. The second reason why we were very aggressive is because of the quality uh of our portfolio. Um and the reason why we are so competitive and we have the not comfortable giving uh IRRs but uh uh I can tell you that um uh it's comfortable uh IRR expectation that that we have. But our portfolio uh we are still able to continue developing shale um tight gas reserve instead of uh shale gas. Most of our uh colleagues in the industry in order to uh to maintain production or to growth or or to slightly growth its production has been going after uh or developing shale shale gas while we have the fortune of uh of having within our portfolio still uh good reserves of tight gas uh which are favorable in in economic terms vis a vis uh vis a vis saying. That's why we have we've been so aggressive. So going forward after the growth that we will have in in twenty twenty two and until new um and new infrastructure is built, the only chance to continue growing, as I said, is through exports uh to Chile. Thank you. Our next question comes from Constantino Papalias from Puente. Good morning and congratulations on the result, thank you. Could you share your expectations on the edit impact by the maturity of the one hundred and eighty megawatt PPAs of Loma della Latta? Hi Constantino. So there's two PPAs that mature this year. One very small, uh Kirena in July of this year, and then the big one, uh Loma de Lata combined performer basis, it's uh sixty million dollars uh per year of decrease. So they will be billing around fifteen million dollars per year of E of V TA um as we speak. Going forward, I mean spot energy. Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from uh Guillermo Levi from Morgan Stanley. I want you to understand the current appetite uh for to advance in new MA in EMT. If the company could take advantage of the current macro environment to expand its shale lake range at a more attractive valuation, even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. Sorry. I wanted to understand the current appetite to advancing new MA opportunity in EMP. If the company could take advantage of the current macro environment to expand its shale acreage at a more attractive evolution, even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. I would say that we we are very comfortable with the gas reserve and the portfolio on on on natural gas that that we have and we don't need to increase uh those reserves. Uh it could be different on the on the all sides. We uh as has always been in our history and continues to be, we are always uh searching for for opportunities. Nothing has nothing concrete has has materialized um but we're still looking for for opportunities on the all all side um oil research um uh in Argentina. Thank you Gros. Uh there is one question about M and A from Michael Shen uh is very related to to the last one. Uh what opportunities to invest or acquire gas related assets given the improving outlook. Is the probability of the new pipeline increasing uh based on support from an interest from an interest of the IMF. No, uh I I think that the the part of the UMA I already answered. We we are not look uh it doesn't make sense uh for us uh to increase our portfolio of uh natural gas. Uh not not even if the the the pipeline is uh built and we can significantly increase our production. We we have uh um we have reserves of excellent quality um probably the most um competitive on the of the Neukina basing. So we we don't see a need to to increase our portfolio there. Um regarding the D IMF I have n no clue what the IMF uh the things about this but I would say that uh it's so obvious that uh it was helped the the macro of Argentina the the the cost of building this pipel pipeline will be repaid uh almost immediately, probably in a year, year and a half, two years. Obviously we it will depend on what the uh at what price um the win winter gas is sold in Argentina and what what is the import parity that we will be replacing. But I'm sure uh uh and uh within current um pricing gets repaid uh very very quickly so uh although I I cannot tell you for sure I would say that the the to anyone that analyzes the situation it's it's an obvious it's very obvious that Argentina needs to to Thank you, Goose. Our next question comes there was another question from Ezequiel Fernandez from Balance. The second question is related to the cash position. With the twenty twenty two cash flow also expected to be pretty good, what are you thinking about cash use cash uses regarding buyouts, the twenty twenty three bonds or possible investment during the next year? Regarding our cash position we have first we'll be increasing our uh investments within our uh uh our core businesses so in order to uh increase our gas production by thirty percent ne ne next year. That that is a significant um capex that we will be doing. We will also we hope to as as Lila uh s said we we are eager to expand our um uh wind farm uh trepe tres by we are deciding between sixty to eighty megawatts of uh of capacity uh and started construction uh as soon as possible. Um and and regarding repurchase of our own uh assets, you know that we do that on a opportunistic um situation so uh if if there is an opportunity to repurchase our our own debt or uh our own shares we would probably go back to that. We have been we have not been doing so uh recently because because of the uh the price the because both our debt and our shares have has been recently uh going up. So we we've stopped repurchase of shares and we haven't been repurchasing uh our own debt for for a while. But we might presume at any time if there is an opportunity. Thank you, Gulf. Our next question comes from Anne Millen from Bank of America. She has two questions. The first one, you commented there was a temporary price increases for some thermal capacity between September and May and linked with exports by CAMESA. Can you tell us more about this quiz and this is not only for thermal it's also for hydro. Yeah it was just uh published um um a few days ago and it's two things. Um for the um legacy capacity in in power generation uh machines that had a low dispatch uh were were not collecting the full price of capacity. They were collecting uh if I'm not wrong seventy percent of the the full price of capacity because of their low dispatch. Sixty six sixty percent of the of the price of the capacity. Um what they have uh eliminated this uh reduction factor so and they did it on um let's uh retroactive retroactive since September. So from September to to May this reduction in the price of capacity has uh disappeared. That in our case it helps our uh Central Thermica Güemes in the north and central Piedra Buena in the south of the province of Buenos Aires which are steam turbines that have low low dispatch. That roughly to give you an idea, uh has a one one point two million dollars per month of uh of additional uh revenues. And the other news was this new fund uh related to export of electricity to to Brazil and uh as long as camisa continues uh and we feel that it will continue throughout all the the summer and into uh until next May, exporting electricity to Brazil. Part of that profit is shared with the uh legacy capacity. So um I think it's ten dollars per uh megawatt hour that is that goes to this fund and uh and the fund is shared among the uh the units that have dispatched energy during during that month. And for example for us in the m month of September that that was an additional one point two million dollars of of revenues. So in total both these um the these two these new um these two new regulatory changes added uh in September two point five million dollars uh of revenues. Thank you, Goose. Our second question from Anne Nyune is uh 2022 outlook. Uh let me mention that we don't give any guidance. Uh we can give you uh what we have in the budget. The question is, what are your current CapEx forecasts for new ye for next year. How do you expect the power and oil and gas market to evolve next year to the extent it is possible to provide any comment com any commentary? Hi Ann, how are you? So this year has been a a very uh interesting year. Next year we expect to maintain a little bit lower uh the the EMP capex. Uh EMP this year is forecasted to end at around two hundred million dollars. Next year it's uh it's we'll be close to that but a little bit lower because a lot has been done this year, that's the first year of Plan Gas. Uh power generation will remain very similar uh a little bit higher. This year was forty million dollars. Next year we are expecting to do only sixty. This is just maintenance. Uh there's no expansions in this and this is not including Barragan. And that's it. It's uh compare this year total is uh two hundred and fifty million dollars more or less, of Capalex. And next year we are expecting something a little bit lower than that, but pretty similar. Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from Florencia Majorga from MetLise. After impressive deliberate deliberating, what's next for Pampa? Do you expect to keep leverage below one point five times on a consistent basis? Okay, so the answer would be no. In general term terms we feel comfortable below two point five X but if there are some opportunities for investment in the upcoming years, uh that ratio could could increase a little bit. Thank you, Nico. Our next question comes from Carolina Carneiro from Craig Suisse. Uh this is related to the legacy remuneration uh in addition to the transit transitionary uh remuneration we got uh this this month. Uh do we ha do we have any updates for price adjustment scheme for legacy capacity generation? Any views on generation dispatch you can share for next quarters given hydro situation in Latin America and possible impacts from La Niña. uh regarding uh remuneration of our legacy capacity will be all until next uh February. That is when uh then the next February we should be getting the price adjustment as remember this year we've got a twenty nine percent increase, it was slightly below twenty twenty inflation. Uh we think that this February we will be collecting something similar to twenty twenty one uh inflation. That that's what I I think is most probable scenario, but uh it's personal expectation. There's no guidance from from the regulator. Thank you, Boose. Our next question uh is an additional question from Alejandra Aranda from Bank uh Itau. Follow up, how much do you believe we could export to Chile and what kind of prices are you getting? Okay. We we we are currently exporting uh one point five million cubic meters of natural gas per day to Colbum uh that's on a firm basis and then um interrumpible how do you say interrup uh Yeah, it's spot gas. We are selling around uh an additional in average it changes every it changes every day but a around half a million uh cubic meter of of gas, additional gas. So between between one point eight to two million cubic meters of natural gas per day is what we are currently selling to to Chile. Uh ex expectation going forward but uh it's not gonna happen until the probably the next spring in Argentina could be to to double those those exports. But eh it's not something that will have would happen in the in the short term. That we are at full production capacity these days. And until May of next year we we are almost at full capacity of production. Thank you, Booth. Uh please hold while we poll for more questions. Oh ye next question comes from Liliana Yang uh from HSBC. Could you please disclose Copex plans through business segment? Keep in mind that this is not a guidance, uh this is the latest uh budget that we have. Hi Lily, how are you? So um because some people are saying that big room here this part. Basically this year we are ending two hundred and fifty million dollars of CapEx. This is at the restricted group, two hundred from from EMP. Next year um we are uh estimating something a little bit lower than that. It's around a hundred and and eighty ninety. Not very uh different from this year, but a little bit lower. Our generation is a little bit higher. This year was forty million dollars of maintainance maintenance capex. Remember that we ended all our expansions in the restricted group next year. There's some special maintenance capex that we have to do, so we will ramp up from forty to sixty. And then the rest is very small. This is just a PEC ten. So overall, this year two fifty, next year around to forty, around those levels. Very similar, but lower. Thank you, Lila. Please follow the poll for more questions. Our next question and final one is from Alonso Mesa from Larrain. How do you feel about your current netback level? Should we expect further deterioration of the listing cost? No, we we we we are not expecting a further deterioration of the listing costs and we are comfortable as shown by the aggressiveness uh in the last uh round of the plant gas bidding. We are very comfortable with the netback levels that that we have in in the natural gas system. Thank you, Goose. Um this concludes the QA session. I uh we will turn to Lira for final remarks. Well thank you so much for joining us uh in this exciting quarter. Goose, Gabby, Nico, would you like to make some remarks? Gabby, some words? Well hi everybody. Uh just to say goodbye as Gustavo mentioned. Uh it has been very great eighteen years uh in this position and um I'm I I am stepping down only on my executive uh function but I will stay in in in the board so it's also a great honor for for me. And uh well essentially I I um I don't know what I'm going to do. Uh so it's it's let's as you know it's like a kind of sabbatical and uh I'm quite confident that the pump is in very good shape. Uh so that's why I felt comfortable to to make this move at this point in time. So I know that Nico and all the team will make a great job and uh I'm also here so uh new new generation and um for for new transactions as I hope that will come hopefully soon. So thank you very much for everybody. All right. See you next quarter in ma in March. Thank you so much. Any questions? Just let us know. Write us. Contact us. We are available for you. This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time. Goodbye.",

I'm Margarita Chun from IR, and we would like to welcome everyone to Pampa Energia's Third Quarter 2021 Results Video Conference. We inform you that this event is being recorded. All participants will be in listen only mode during the presentation. After the company's remarks there will be a Q&A session. Questions can only be submitted in writing inaudible. Should any participant need assistance, please sent us a text message or email. Before proceeding, please read the disclaimer that is, that is located on the second page of our presentation. Let me mention that forward-looking statements are based on Pampa Energia's management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions because they are related to future events that may or may not occur. Investors should understand that, that general economic conditions and industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Pampa Energia and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Now I will turn the video conference over to Gustavo Mariani, our CFO. <silence> Sorry. Hello everybody and thank you for joining our conference call. Uh, in ca- in case, uh, you missed, you missed the news online… inaudible Sorry about… <laugh>. In case, uh, you missed, uh, the news Gabby Cohen, after sharing 18 years w- with us, decided to step down from his CFO position. Uh, fortunately, he will remain as a member of our Board of Directors. So, uh, we will continue taking advantage of his wisdom and, and, and expertise. Um, Gabby's well earned, uh, trust and respect from the investor community has allowed Pampa to, to become what the company that it is today. So, uh, our appreciation is tough to, uh, to, to say in a, in a few words. Um, Gabby, thank you very much for all you have done for the, for, for the company. Um, yesterday the Board of Directors accepted, uh, Gabby's resignation and, uh, appointed, uh, Nicolas Mindlin, who is sitting at my right as the, as our new, uh, CFO. Uh, Nico is an industrial engineer. Uh, he has been leading the M&A division of Pampa for eight years already. Uh, he has played a key role in the acquisition of Petrobras Argentina, a significant milestone for, for our company. And since then he has been focusing, a, among other things, in reorganizing the, the portfolio of assets, um, to focus in the core business that, that we have today. Uh, Nico, uh, together with Gabby's team, um, has all that is necessary to, uh, to succeed in, in his role. So we wish him, um, good luck in the, in his new endeavor. Nico? Thank you Gustavo for your support. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining. Uh, I'm very excited… Sorry. I'm very excited to, to begin this new chapter of my professional career in Pampa. I have been working in, uh, Pampa along with Gustavo, Gabby, and all of Pampa's team and partners for the last eight years. Uh, Gabby has done an excellent job in… on the financial front. He has put together an excellent team. So the idea is to continue on the same path. So now that travels and conferences are slowly resuming, uh, I can't wait to meet all of Pampa's investors in person soon. So now I will pass to Lida, uh, who will briefly comment on the quarter highlights, and then later we will open to the Q&A. Thank you Nico. Nico. Hello everyone. In the interest of time, I will summarize the latest events and financial figures. For more details, you can check our earnings release or feel free to contact us. On quarter's highlights, our E&P business achieved all-time high production of almost 330 million cubic feet per day in September as you can see in the graph. Also, we recorded the highest single day outputs at 350 million cubic feet per day, precisely on September 15. The recovery of demand, exports, and Plan Gas have been the main contributors for this growth. Moreover, this month, we participated in the first round of Plan Gas, a take-or-pay option to fill the remaining idle capacity at Neuquina Basin. The tender… we tendered and got awarded 71 million cubic feet per day, 2 \/ 3 of the total tender volume committed to deliver from May 2022 until December 2024 at three hund- three dollars… $3.35 per MBTU. Therefore, the following winter, we should be producing a new all-time high of 400 million cubic feet per day building an annual average price of $3.6 per million BTU. We highlight that Pampa is the only producer delivering the most significant gas increase compared to the winter of 2020. In power generation, we are moving on with, uh, PEPE Spanish, uh, PEPE III Wind Farm expansion project by doubling its capacity to reach a total of 106 megawatts. We assumed a roughly $80 million of investment that will allow us to keep increasing our clean energy portfolio and strengthening our position in the business-to-business market. In Q3, we achieved a substantial leverage reduction. Our net debt decreased by $125 million in a single quarter. Year-to-date we have accumulated $230 million of net leverage reduction. Finally, we just wanted to let you know that we released a 2020… our 2020 sustainability report audited for the first time. We show material improvements in water consumption, energy consumption, with carbon footprint intensities in line with the previous year's efforts to invest in efficient power technology and focus on gas. We seek transparency to share our EN… ESG performance with our stakeholders and your opinion is always welcome. Now let's move on to the quarter's financial KPIs. Revenues increased 49% year-on-year to $577 million in the quarter, mainly driven by Plan Gas boosted by the winter season, demand recovery, and commodities price hikes. All of them were partially offset by certain power plant outages and tariff fees in our utility business. In Q3, over 85% of our sales and EBITDA were dollar linked. The adjusted EBITDA amounted to $262 million, 27% year-on-year due to, uh, the same reasons detailed before offset by higher E&P activity. Quarter-on-quarter, EBITDA increased by 9% mainly due to the seasonality and higher petchem volumes sold offset by increased raw material costs in petchem and outages at Energia Plus power units. Thanks to the strong investments and production growth, oil and gas is balancing back its EBITDA share for the first time in three years. CapEx almost doubled year-on-year in Q3 but, uh, remains similar quarter-on-quarter mainly because of the Plan Gas and Barragan expansion, offset by the commissioning of Genelba's second CCGT back in July 2020. Moving on to power generation as seen on slide seven. We posted an adjusted EBITDA of $126 million in Q3, slightly lower year-on-year mainly due to the outages that we said before and the end of Piquirenda's 10-year PPA, offset by higher B2B sales and higher thermal dispatch, especially at Loma. In the legacy units, the 29% PEPE swap that received last February was diluted by the inflation… devaluation. Quarter-on-quarter, EBITDA increased marginally due to the better B2B sales and seasonality offset by the retroactive spot price uptake. And spot energy is 59% of our capacity but only represented 24% of our power generation EBITDA which will keep shrinking unless recognition of prior adjustments keep up with the valuation. As these essential units to the grid continue being underpaid, it will be challenging to maintain them properly. However, recently, the government approved a price improvement for thermal legacy units, especially those with low load factor. Said improvement is temporary, payable between September and May, and linked with the electricity exports made by CAMMESA. Moving to Pampa's spot operating figures. Power generation in Q3 was 13% up year-on-year surpassing nationwide demand. We recorded higher CCGT dispatch at Loma and Genelba number one CCGT due to the better gas supply plus increased thermal dispatch with alternative fuels offset by the Plus unit's outages and low water import at Pichi Picun Leufu. Quarter-on-quarter the output rose 18% driven by seasonality but offset by the aforementioned outages. The power generation business model relies on capacity payments so the most important is to keep the availability as high as possible especially for PPAs. The availa- availability rate in Q3 reached 95%, slightly lower year-on-year mainly due to new units' and Energia Plus units' partial outages. Regarding our expansions, the closing to CCGT at Ensenada Barragan is more than 60% advanced. We continue working on the steam turbine, cooling tower, boilers and diverters. Also we are finishing the civil works and commissioning the high-voltage field. Around 1,700 people work in two shifts with all the COVID protocols in place to achieve the COD by sec- second quarter of 2022. Moving to the E&P, we posted an adjusted EBITDA of $104 million in Q3, a remarkable growth year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by Plan Gas, winter season, and demand recovery, offset by more royalties and resumption of activity. Our total lifting costs increased 36% year-on-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, explained by higher production output. However, lifting costs per unit stood at $6 per BOE, 11% more than last year but similar to Q2. This is mainly thanks to El Mangrullo's high productivity. Our global production increased 23% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter, again, mainly driven by Plan Gas, winter, and the local oil demand recovery to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we averaged more than 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 92% is gas, is gas. On the oil side, which represented 23% of the segment's revenue in the quarter, volumes sold increased by 40% year-on-year and 31% quarter-on-quarter to 5,900 barrels per day mainly explained by the local demand offset by lower exports. And oil price, driven by the Brent was 50% increase compare-… driven by the events, was 50% increase compared to the last year, but remains seen quarter on quarter. Regarding gas, as shown in slide 10, our volumes still average, uh, 326 million cubic feet per day in the quarter, roughly 25% up, uh, read, year on year and quarter on quarter, from the recent inaudible before. Going back to our production performance, as I said before, we reached an all time high record in September. Again, the numbers show what the quarter's growth consummating close to 70% of our overall gas. This block is wholly owned and operated by us with outstanding productivity boasted by the increased capacity. Our learned average price of the quarter was $4.4 per unit used. 76% up year to year and 14% increase quarter on quarter. Again, explaining the inaudible the peak is being sent spot prices out of the CSA, also selected the inaudible gas pricing levels. As you can see why below, the year to day sales are more diversified. Similar to the country's breakdown, gas retailers are also part of the supply in gas and they have priority in the winter, increasing their share to 39%. Also we are growing, as you can see, our B2B share. Regarding our EMP operations today, we strengthened our induction by recording $52 million during the quarter while it was marginal last year. This quarter we drilled eight times as well, also we completed 16 wells of which 15 are Tyke and one is Shell from foreign language A lot that which the maximum production rate of 28 cubic feet per day, becoming one of the most productive gas wells in foreign language Also as I said in the previous call, we are expanding the gas treatment plan among these so, reaching about 320 million cubic feet per day by the first half of next year. Now we drill 15 wells, and continue ten at foreign language Moving to the petrochemical business, we posted an account DVDA of $7 million in inaudible similar year on year, he higher raw material costs and inaudible compensated for the significant rise in commodity prices and industrial demand we covered. Quarter on quarter, DVDA halved, driven by higher raw material costs offset by increased sales of reforming products. The year on year and quarter on quarter to those sales volume increase was significant, especially with forming products. In addition of the quarter sales were exported. About cash and debt, so we are raising our CAPEX to accommodate more gas and we must highlight another quarter with solid cash flow position, generation. Driven by the outstanding operating performance from now our core businesses, and improved margins in the out streak. inaudible cash resulted in roughly $108 million. In comparison, last year's quarter represented $58 million stop flow due to the higher working capital. Notice that this quarter, working capital and others were positive, mostly swayed by improved collections from foreign language as shown in slide 13. Delays halved to 22 days compared to the maximum 46 days achieved in Q1 of this year. In addition we repaid a net of $50 million of principle debt and bought back shares for $3 million. So in total we generated $44 million of net cash, achieving $507 million of cash position by the end of the quarter. Moving on to slide 14, this slide shows consolidated figures including our affiliate ownership, but let's focus on the restricted group that reflects the bond parameters. As we began the call, our balance keeps trending despite the context. We continued to review the cross sales, having canceled most of the inaudible through the quarter for $55 million, posting $1.5 million as of September 2021. Almost 100% of that is eliminating dollars up from the 96% in June. The dollar debt bears an average interest rate of 7.8%. The average life we may see is 4.7 years. As said before, cash increase, 10% quarter on quarter to $507 million. Therefore, net debt decreased by $125 million to $917 million, a remarkable reduction just in a single quarter. Given the lower debt and higher VDA, the net ratio improved from 1.7 to 1.4 times quarter on quarter. In the next 12 months, the company faces less than $20 million of maturities. Therefore, we expect to keep trending our balance sheet. As a result, S&P upgraded our standalone rating to B- This concludes our presentation, and before we would like to open the Q&A session, Mary. Yes, thank you for waiting. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please send it through the Zoom chat. We will read and answer them in the order they're received. Also please make sure your name and company are easily displayed to introduce you to the audience. Please lower your hand once your question is answered. Should any participant need assistance, send us a message or raise your hand. Please hold while we poll for questions. <silence> Our first question is from inaudible from Bank of America. How much additional upside do you see in that over the next few years? To what extent could this be held or limited by transportation capacity? inaudible thank you for joining us in the call. We believe that the transportation going out from the inaudible will be almost or completely full next winter. So as we have been saying, we talked about this in a previous conference call, it is crucial for the country to increase its infrastructure and transportation capacity from the foreign language to Buenos Aires and to the center of the country. We are going to be constantly working on that project. We hope it will be launched soon but we have no clarity on when that will happen. But definitely the country, in order to continue increasing the capital action and keep innovating, we need to build new infrastructure. And this makes a lot of sense for the country because to this new pipeline, the country will be replacing expensive imports that we do, gas from Bolivia, that costs a dollar from the local producers are receiving. We will import less energy which costs at least four or five times more expensive. And we are also importing during the winter and… inaudible meaning for all these imports, those that are scarce in the country. So regarding the additional lot size for a company like us, until this new pipeline is constructed, it could come from exports to Chile. And now that the transportation capacity out of foreign language is complete, it makes sense to allow the perm exports to Chile… not only on the summer months but throughout the year. That will be the next step of growth for the industry. So I'm not going into numbers because we haven't committed on the third round. Our growth on Winter of 2022, vis a vie, this winter will be roughly about 30%, so next winter we will be 11 million inaudible per day, starting in May. There is at least 8.5 million cubic meters of gas per day that we will deliver this winter. This winter we have been rounding up, starting at February and ending in September at 9.5. Originally, we were thinking that our production was going to slow down during the summer months, but thanks to the export of electricity that the country's doing to Brazil, we are able to maintain the production, so we currently are selling the same level that we sold during the winter and we are keeping a plateau of 9.3, 9.5 million cubic meters of gas per day. And we see this situation will stay throughout the summer and probably until next May when our production will jump again to 11 million. I think that… Thank you inaudible our next question comes from Jessica Hernandez from foreign language she says, Question is about, results were great on the oil and gas side, but listing costs have been increasing as of late. $6 per barrel, this is almost $1 per barrel versus one year ago. Is this related to the production run off? Perhaps costs there inaudible related to global supply chain. How should we think about this going forward? There is a second question but let's answer the first one. Hi this is Jen, how are you? So basically yes, it's an important piece in our production side, there's more fixed cost. And also we, this is the first year of the pipeline so, and that inaudible And then there's a lot of increases in salaries, in wages, so in real tens of dollars, it's an increase. And the second question is very related to the first one. Also, are you perceiving cost increases in rig and drilling equipment that you should be using-… free from breaks in drilling equipment that you should be using next year? Or are you already contracted for that? We, eh, he- air, we, we already contracted, and we've seen a slight increase in, in costs, but nothing out of normal. Thank you. Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Alejandra Aranda from foreign language. It's very related to the first question of Frank. Could you give us an update of what you're seeing the gas market and bottleneck to further develop the segment and timing of next plan gas inaudible round or further alternatives that you could explore to continue increasing volumes? Or should we view the 11 million inaudible meters per day on winter at inaudible for the near future? Could you share development costs? And what are your other costs are you using for a e- for new project? Well… Hmm. What? No. It's a, it's that, uh, we should be viewing… It depends. If we get, um, the, the new pipeline, the new main pipeline that, uh, the inaudible allowed to, to make it happen, we could see by 2023, I would say 2024, given the timing of, of building, what, uh, uh, a better and tighter winter production, uh, by 2024. You see, you saw in, in the presentation we expect to get the million by 2022, but, in order to increase from that, we are still link- depends on the expansion in the main pipeline. What do you think about that, Gustavo, about the bottleneck? Em… The, the reason why we were so aggressive in this go-around is difficult. We, we unders- Two things, but one is that we understand that, eh, until the, the new pipeline is working, eh, the gas market from inaudible will be very much constrained. That's why we wanted to be, eh, aggressive, eh, here. There's a good reason why we were very aggressive is because of the quality, eh, of our portfolio. Em, and the reason why we are so competitive and we have, eh, we're not comfortable giving, uh, higher inaudible for the, eh, and tell you that, um, that, uh, comfortable, eh, inaudible our expectation that, that we have. But our portfolio, eh, we are still able to continue developing shale and tight gases are, instead of in shale gas. Most of our, eh, colleagues in the industry, in order to, em, to maintain production or to growth, or to slightly growth this production has been going after, eh, or developing shale, shale gas. While we have the fortune of, eh, of having in our portfolio still, eh, good reserves of tight gas, eh, which are favorable in, in economic terms, because inaudible, eh, is at least cheap. Eh, that's why we have, we've been so aggressive. So going forward, after the growth that we were having 2022, eh, and until new, em, a new infrastructure is built, the only chance to continue growing, as I said, is to export, eh, to Chile, for increasing our market share of export to Chile. Eh, that is the, the situation. Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Constantino Poparias from Gwen Bay. Good morning and congratulations on the inaudible. Thank you. Could you share your expectations on the inaudible path by the inaudible of the 180 megawatt PPAs of foreign language? Hi, Constantino for you. So there's two PPAs at inaudible this year, one very small, eh, foreign language, in July of this year. And then, the big one, uh, foreign language. Combined for four more bases is, uh, 60 million dollars, uh, per year of decrease. So they will be billing around 50 million dollars per year inaudible, um, as we speak. inaudible Energy. Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from Guiler Mileri from Morgan Stanley. I wanted to understand the current appetite, uh, for to advance a new amenity in Yempti. If the company could take advantage of the current market environment to expand the shale acreage at a more attractive valuation, even if shale gas inaudible is not a priority at this point. inaudible, could you repeat the question? Sorry. I wanted to understand the current appetite to advance a new amenity opportunity inaudible P, if the company could take advantage of the current market environment to expand its shale acreage at a more attractive valuation, even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. Eh, um, I would say that we, we are very comfortable with the, the gas reserve in the portfolio on, on natural gas that, that we have. And we don't need to increase, eh, those reserves. Eh, it could be different on the, on the oil side. Eh, we, uh, are forward leaning in our history and continues to be. We are always, eh, searching for, for opportunities. Nothing has, nothing complete has, has materialized, eh, but we still looking for, for opportunities on the oil, oil side, em, oil, oil reserves, eh, in Argentina. Thank you, Glos. Uh, there is one question about MNA from Michael Shim. Uh, it's related to, to the last one. Uh, what opportunities to invest or acquire gas-related assets given the improving outlook? Is there probability of the new pipeline increasing, eh, based on support from an interest, from an interest of the IMF? Not inaudible, eh, the, the point of view inaudible I already answer. We are not looking… Doesn't make sense, eh, for us, eh, to increase our portfolio of, eh, natural gas. Em, not, not even if the, the, the pipeline is, eh, built and we can significantly increase our production. We, we have a, eh, we have reserves of excellent quality, em, probably the most, em competitive on the, of the inaudible innovation. So we, we don't see a need to, to increase our portfolio there. Em, regarding the IMF, I have no clue what the IMF, uh, eh, thinks about this, but I would say that, eh, it's so obvious that, eh, it will cut the, the macro of Argentina. Eh, eh, the cost of building this pipel- pipeline will be repaid, eh, almost immediately, probably in a year, a year and a half, two years. Obviously, it w- it will depend on what the ad- at what price, em, em, win- winter gas is sold in Argentina and what were this, the import parity that we will be replacing. But I'm sure, eh, and it, eh, within current, em, pricing gets repaid, eh, very, very quickly. So, uh, although I, I cannot tell you for sure, I will say that the, the, to anyone that analyzes the situation, it's, it's an obvious, it's very obvious that Argentina needs to, to do this pipeline. Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes… There was another question from inaudible Fernandez from Valens. inaudible question is related to the cash position. With the 2022 cashflow of, uh, expected to be pretty good, what are you thinking about trash use- past uses regarding buy outs, the 2023 bonds, or possible investment during the next year? Eh, regarding our cash position, we have first will be increasing our, eh, investments within our, eh, our core businesses. So in order to, eh, increase our gas production by 30% n- n- next year, that, that it's a, a significant, eh, inaudible we will be doing. We will also, we hope to a- inaudible, eh, s- say that we, we are eager to expand our, eh, wind farm, eh, <unk> by… We are deciding between 60 to 80 megawatts of, eh, of capacity, eh, and started construction as soon as possible. Em, and, and regarding repurchase of our own, eh, assets, you know that we do that on our opportunistic, em, situations. So, eh, it, if there's an opportunity to repurchase our, our own debt or, eh, our own shares, we will probably go back to do that. We have been… We have not been doing so, eh, recently, because, because of the, eh, the price, the, because both our debt and our shares has, has been recently been going up. We, so we've, we've stopped repurchase of shares. And we haven't been repurchasing, eh, our own debt for, for a while. But we might resume that any time based on opportunity. Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Ann Mullins from Bank of America. She has two questions. The first one, you commented there was a temporary price increases for some thermal capacity between September and May and linked with exports by Conisa. Can you tell us more about this, please? And this is not only for thermal, it's also for hydro. Yeah, it was just, uh, published, um, um, a few days ago. And it's two things. Em, for the legacy capacity in, in power inaudible, eh, eh, machines that had a low dispatch, eh, were, were not collecting the full price of capacity. They were collecting, eh, if I'm inaudible, burned 70% of the, the full price of capacity, because of their low dispatch. 60, 60% of the price of the capacity. Em… What they have, eh, eliminated this, uh, with action factor, so f- and they did on a, um, on a foreign language? They retracted, retracted since September. So, em, from September to, to May, this, eh, reduction in the price of capacity has, eh, disappear. That, in our case, helps our, eh, central foreign language in the north, and central, em, foreign language in the south of the inaudible Buenos Aires, which are steel turbine that have no, low dispatch. Eh-… inaudible that have low, low dispatch. Em… that roughly, to give you an idea, eh, has a $1.2 million per month of, uh, of additional, eh, revenues. And, the other news was this, eh, new… fund, eh, related to export of electricity to, to Brazil. And, em, as long as inaudible continues, eh, and we think that it will continue throughout all the, the summer and into, until next May, exporting electricity to Brazil, part of that profit is shared with the inaudible capacity. So, um, I think it's $10 per megawatt-hour, that is, that goes to this fund, and, uh, the fund is shared among the, uh, the units that have dispatched energy during, during that month. And for example, for us, in the mo- month of September, that- that was an additional $1.2 million of, of revenues. So in total, both this em, this two, this new, eh, these two new regulatory changes added, eh, in September, $2.5 million, eh, of revenues. Thank you, inaudible. Our second question from inaudible is, uh, 2022 outlook. Uh, let me mention that we don't give any vitals. Uh, we can give you, uh, what we have in production. The question is, what are your current CapEx forecasts for new e- for next year? How do you expect the power, and oil and gas markets to evolve next year, to the extent it is possible to provide any comment, comment, any commentary. inaudible. Hi, Anne, how are you? So, this year has been, uh, a very… uh, interesting year. Next year, we expect to maintain a little bit lower, uh, the, the EMP CapEx. The EMP this year is forecasted to end at around $200 million. The next year, it's uh, it's… will be close to that, but a little bit lower, because a lot has been done this year. That's the first year of plan inaudible. Power generation will remain very similar, uh, a little bit higher. This year was $40 million. Next year, we are expecting to do only 60 because inaudible. Uh, there's no expansions and this, and this is not including Bahrain. And that's, uh, that's uh, compare this year to inaudible it, uh, $250 million, more or less, of CapEx. And next year we are expecting something a little bit lower than that, or pretty similar. Thank you Elise. Our next question comes from Florencia Mashorda from MetLife. After interesting delibera- deliberating. What's next for inaudible, to you expect to keep leverage below one point five times on consistent basis? Okay, so, the answer will be no. And… inaudible will come for the below two point five eight. That's… is where our… some opportunities for investment in the upcoming year. Eh… inaudible to… quote-on- quote illegally. Thank you, Niko. Our next next question comes from Catalina Carnejo from CreditStreet. Uh, this is related to the legacy reveneration, in addition to the transi- transitionary, uh, inaudible we got, uh, this… this month. Uh, do we ha- do we have any updates for prices as inaudible for later, because electric generation? Any views on the generation this patch you can share for next quarter's inaudible situation in Latin America? And possible inaudible from inaudible. Eh… no, w- we are not envisioning a- a thing, where we inaudible views. Eh… regarding, eh… the generation of power capacity. We'll be all, until next… eh, February. That is… when eh… the- the next February… we should be getting the price adjustment of… the number this year, we got 89% increase. It was… slightly, eh- below 2020 inflation. Eh… within that, this February we will be collecting something similar to 2021, eh… inflation. But that's… what I… I think is most probable scenario, but… eh, it's personal expectation. That's no… guidance from… from the inaudible. Thank you, Gouss. Our next question, ah, is an additional question from Alexandra Hernanda from bang- uh, Itawoo. Follow-up, how much do you believe we could export to Chile, and what kind of prices are you getting? Eh, eh- We are currently exporting, eh… 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day to… Paragun. Eh… that's on a firm basis. And, then, eh… foreign language? How do you say foreign language, eh, em… Yeah, s- s- sport gas, we are selling around, eh… an additional… in average, and it change every… it changes every day, but at around half a million, eh… cubic meter of… of gas- additional gas. So… between… between 1.822 million cubic meters of natural gas per day is what we are currently selling to… to Chile. Eh… ex- expectation going forward, but, eh… it's not gonna- gonna happen until… em… probably… em… next spring in Argentina? Could be, to, to… double those- those exports. But, eh… eh, it's not something that would happo- would happen in the short term, that's… we are at full production capacity these days. And uh, uh… until m- May of next year, we- we are almost at… the full capacity of production. Thank you, Gouss. Uh, please hold while we poll for more questions. Our next question comes from… Liliana Yang, uh, from HECC. Could you please disclose inaudible plans for business recommends, if you mind that this is not a guidance, uh, this is the latest project that we have. Hi, how are you? So, um… because some people are seeing that n- decreased here to start, basically this year we are lending $250 million of CapEX to the inaudible group. 200 from… from the NP. Next year, um, we are… uh, estimating something a little bit lower than that. It's around 100 and… 80, 90? Not very… uh, different from this year. But, a little bit lower. Power generation for- a little bit higher this year was $40 million in payments… my payments CapEX. The number that we ended, called our extensions, to the inaudible group next year, there is some special payments CapEX that we have to do, so we will ramp up from 40 to 60. And then the rest is very small, just- just inaudible. So overall, ah, this year's 260, next year around 240, around those inaudible. Very similar, not over. Thank you Alita. Please hold while we poll for more questions. Our next question, and final one, is from Alon Somesa from foreign language. How do you feel about your current netback levels? Should we expect further deterioration of the listing call? No… we, we are not expecting, eh… further deterioration of the listing calls, and we are… comfortable that- shown by the aggressiveness, eh… in the last, eh, round of the… inaudible meeting. We are very comfortable with the netback levels that… that we have in, the natural gas business. Thank you, Gouss. Um, this concludes the Q and A session. I will turn to Leida for final remarks. Oh, thank you so much for joining us! Uh, in this exciting quarter. <unk> Would you like to make some remarks? Ravi? Some words? <laugh> Please? Just- just a goodbye! Uh… Well, hi everybody! I would like to say… goodbye, as Niko mentioned. Uh, for the… very good engineers, eh, and inaudible, and, uh… Um, I… I can second that only on my executive, ehm, inaudible, but I will say… to the board, so it's also going down there for… employees. And, uh… well, especially like, like… um… I don't know what I'm going to do, eh. So, it's- it's reckless inaudible personal flight attendants are vital. And, uh… and I consider the company in very good shape, uh… so that's why I felt comfortable to- to make this move at this, uh, point in time. So… I know that Niko and Oleti will make a great job, and, uh… I'm also here, so… uh, w- regeneration and- and… performing transactions of inaudible that will come… operations. So, thank you very much for you guys. All right, see you next quarter! In m- in March. Thank you so much, any questions, just let us know. Find us… contact us inaudible available or free. This concludes sales presentation, thank you for joining. You may disconnect at this time. Goodbye.",

Now I'll turn the video conference over to Gustavo Mariani over CFO. Sorry. Hello everybody and thank you for joining our conference call. Uh in case in case uh you miss you miss the news. Uh uh uh sorry about that. In case uh you miss the the news. Gabby Cohen after sharing eighteen years with us decided to step down from his CFO position. Uh fortunately he will remain as a member of our board of directors, so uh we will continue taking advantage of his wisdom and and and expertise. Um Gabby's well learned uh trust and respect from the investor community has allowed Pampa uh to become what the company that it is today so uh our appreciation is tough to uh to to say in in a in a few words. Um Gabby, thank you very much for all you have done uh for for the company. Um yesterday the board of directors accepted uh Gabby's resignation and uh appointed uh Nicolas Mindri, who is uh sitting at my right, as the as our new uh CFO. Uh Nico is an industrial engineer. Uh he has been leading the M and A division of Pampa for eight years already. He has played a key role in the acquisition of Cesoblas Argentina, a significant milestone for for our company, and since then has been focusing t uh among other things in reorganizing the the portfolio of asset uh to focus in the core business that that we have today. Nico uh together with Gabby's team um has all that is necessary to uh to succeed in in his role so we wish him um good luck in the in his new endeavor. Okay. Thank you Gustavo for your support. So good morning everyone and thank you for joining. I'm very excited sorry I'm very excited to to end this new chapter of my professional career in Pampa. I have been working uh in Pampa along Gustavo, Gabi and all of Pampa's team and partner for the last eight years. Gabi has done an excellent job in on the financial front. He has put together an excellent team. So the idea is to continue on the same path. So now that travels and conferences are slowly resuming. I can't wait to meet all of Pampa's investors in person soon. So now I will pass to Lida, who will briefly comment on the quarter highlights and then later we will open to the QA. Thank you Nico. Nico Hello everyone. In the interest of time I will summarize the latest events and financial figures for more details. You can check our earnings release or feel free to contact us. On Quarters Highlights, our EMP business achieved all time high production of almost three hundred and thirty million QE feet per day in September, as you can see in the graph. Also, we recorded the highest single day output at three hundred and fifty million Q feet per day, precisely on september. fifteenth The recovery of demand, exports and plant gas have been the main contributors for this growth. Moreover, this month we participated in the first round of Landas, a take or pay option to fill the remaining idle capacity at Ukina Bassi. The tender we tender and got awarded twenty one million QVC per day, twoirds-th of the total tender volume, committing to deliver from May twenty twenty-two until December twenty twenty-four at three dollars three thirty-five dollars per m BTU. Therefore, the following winter we should be producing a new all-time high of 400 million cc per day, building an annual average price of $3.6 per mBTU. We highlight that Pampa is the only producer delivering the most significant gas increase compared to the winter of twenty twenty. In power generation, we are moving on with the PP3s, PP three Wind Fund Expansion project by doubling its capacity to reach a total of a hundred and six megawatts. We estimate roughly eighty million dollars of investment that will allow us to keep increasing our clean energy portfolio and strengthening our position in the business-to-business market. In Q3, we achieve a substantial leverage reduction. Our net debt decreased by one hundred and twenty five million dollars in a single quarter. Year today we have accumulated two hundred and thirty million dollars of net leverage reduction. Finally, we just wanted to let you know that we released a twenty twenty our twenty twenty sustainability report, audited for the first time. We show material improvements in water, consumption, energy consumption, carbon footprint intensities, in line with the previous year's efforts to invest in efficient power technology and focus on gas. We seek transparency to share our ESG performance with our stakeholders, and your opinion is always welcome. Now let's move on to the quarter's financial KPIs. Revenues increase forty-nine percent year on year to five hundred seventy-seven million dollars in the quarter, mainly driven by plant gas boosted by the winter season, demand recovery and commodities price hikes. All of them were partially offset by certain power plant outages and tariff frees in our utility businesses. In Q3, over eighty five percent of our sales and AEVA were dollar leak. The adjusted E VA amounted to two hundred sixty two million dollars, twenty seven% year on year due to uh the same reasons we telled before, offset by higher EMP IT. Quarter on quarter, ABDA increased by nine percent, maybe due to the seasonality and higher. Thanks to the strong investments and production growth, oil and gas is balancing back its C VPA share for the first time in three years. CapEx almost doubled year on year in Q three, but uh remains similar quarter of border, mainly because of the plant gas and barragans expansion observed by the commissioning of Genelba's second CCGT back in July of twenty twenty. Moving on to power generation, as seen in slide seven, we posted an adjusted EDA of $126 million in Q3, slightly lower year on year, mainly due to the outages that we said before and the N of P Kirendas ten year CPA, offset by higher V two V cells and higher thermal dispatch, especially at Loma. In the legacy units, the twenty-nine percent pest salt they received last February was diluted by the inflation. The evaluation side. Quarter on quarter, ABDA increased marginally due to the better B2B cells and seasonality upset by the retroactive spot price update. A spot energy is fifty nine percent of our capacity but only represented twenty four percent of our power generation UVDA, which will keep shrinking unless the condition of prior adjustments keep up with the evaluation. As these essential units to the grid continue being on the pace, it will be challenging to maintain them properly. However, recently the government approved a price improvement for thermal legacy units, especially those with low low factor, set improvement is temporary, payable between September and May, and linked with the electricity exports made by Canada. Moving to Pampas operating figures, power generation in Q free was thirty percent up year on year, surpassing nationwide demand. We recorded higher C C T dispatch a Loma and General No. one C C C T due to the better gas supply plus increased thermal dispatch with alternative fuels, offset by the plus units voltages and low water input at PCPCOM 24. Quarter on quarter the output rose eighteen percent, driven by seasonality, but upset by the aforementioned voltages. The The power generation business model relies on capacity payment, so the most important is to keep the availability as high as possible, especially for PPAs. The availability availability rate in Q3 reached ninety five percent, slightly lower year on year, mainly due to UILES and Energia Plus units partial outages. Reling our expansions, the closing to CGT at Ensenaba Ragan is more than 50% advanced. We continue working on the steam toil line, cooling tower, boilers, and diverters. Also we are finishing the cellar works and commissioning the high voltage fuel. Around seventeen hundred people work in two ships with all the COVID protocols in place to achieve facility by th second quarter of twenty twenty two. Moving to the EMP, we posted an adjusted EPA of one hundred and four million dollars in Q free, a remarkable growth year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by climb gas, winter season and demand recovery, offset by more royalties and resumption of activity. Our total lifting cost increased thirty six percent year on year and twenty six percent quar on quarter, explained by higher production output. However, lifting costs per unit stood at six dollars per BoE, eleven percent more than last year, but similar to Q2. This is mainly thanks to El Mangru's high productivity. Our global production increased twenty three percent year on year and twenty percent quarter on quarter. Again, mainly driven by Trangas winter and the local old demand recovery to pre pandemic levels. As a result, we average more than fifty seven thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which ninety two percent is gas. On the other side, which represented twenty-three percent of the segment's revenue in the quarter, volume sold increased by forty percent year on year and thirty-one percent quarter on quarter to five point nine thousand barrels per day. Mainly explained by the local demand, upset by lower exports. And oil price driven by the rent was fifty percent increased compared to the last year, but remain similar quarter on quarter. Regarding gas, as showing the slide ten, our volumes will average uh three hundred and twenty six million cubic feet per day in the quarter, roughly twenty five percent up uh read year on year and quarter on quarter for the reasons it's going be before. Going back to our production performance, as I say before, we reach an all-time high record in September. Again, El Mangruscio led the quarters growth, contributing close to 70% of our overall gas. This block is wholly owned and operated by us with outstanding productivity boosted by the increased shipment capacity. Our live average price of the quarter was four point four dollars per mu BTU, seventy six percent up year on year and forty uh fourteen percent increase quarter on quarter. Again, explained by the Plan Gas in their peak. The B2B and spot prices out of this GSA also reflected the seasonality similar to Plant Gas pricing levels. As you can see right below, the year-to-day sales were are more diversified, similar to the country's breakdown. Gas retailers are also part of the twin gas and they have priorities in the winter, increasing their share to thirty nine percent. Also we are growing, as you can see, our B2B share. Regarding our EMP operations update, we strengthened our investment by recording fifty two million dollars during the quarter while it was marginal last year. This quarter we reeled eight tight gas wells, also we completed sixteen wells, of which fifteen are tight, and one is shell from Sierra Chata, a block that reached the maximum production rate of twenty eight million K C per day, becoming one of the most productive gas wells in Bacamorta. Also, as I said in the previous call, we are expanding the gas treatment planet in Mangruo, reaching about three hundred and ten million CV feet per day by the first half of next year. In oil, we drilled thirteen wells and completed ten at the Governador Ayala and el Torvish. Moving to the petrochemical business, we posted an adjusted EDA of seven million dollars in the Q Free, similar year on year, the higher raw material costs and plant gas, in fact, compensated for the significant rise in commodity prices and industrial demand recovery. Quote on quarter, the APDA have driven by higher raw material costs offset by increased sales of reforming products. The year on year and quote unquote total cells volume increase was significant, especially in reforming products. In addition, roughly fifty percent of the quarter cells were exported. About cash and debt, though we are raising our capex to accommodate and gas commitments, we must highlight another quarter week solid cash flow position uh generation, driven by the outstanding operating performance from our core businesses and improved margins in the upstream. During Q free, the free cash flow resulted in roughly a hundred and eight million dollars million dollars. In comparison, last year's quarter represented a sixty eight million dollars also due to the higher working capital. Notice that this quarter, working capital and others were positive, most displaying by improved collections from Clamesa as shown in slide thirteen. Delays have to twenty three days compared to the maximum forty six days achieved in Q one of this year. In addition, we repaid a net of sixty million dollars of principal debt and bought back shares for three million dollars. So in total we generated forty four million dollars of net cash, achieving five hundred and seven five hundred and oh seven million dollars of cash position by the end of the quarter. Moving on to the slide fourteen. This slide shows consolidated figures cons including our affiliate ownership, but let's focus only on the restricted group that reflects the bomb perimeters. As we began the call, our balance sheet keeps strengthening despite the context. We continue to reduce the cross step, having cancelled most of the test maturities through the quarter for sixty five million dollars, posting one point five million dollars as of September twenty twenty one. Almost a hundred percent of the debt is denominating dollars, up from the ninety six percent in June. The dollar debt bears an average interest rate of seven point eight percent. The average life remains similar at four point seven years. I' saidve before, cash increased ten percent quarter unquarter to five hundred and seven million million dollars. Therefore, net debt decreased by one hundred and twenty five million dollars to nine hundred seventeen million dollars are a remarkable reduction just in a single quarter. Given the lower debt and higher VDA, the net leverage ratio are improved from one point seven to one point four times quarter on quarter. In the next twelve months, the company faces less than twenty million dollars of maturities. Therefore, we expect to keep strengthening our balance sheet. As a result, SMP upgraded our standalone rating to B minus. So this concludes our presentation and before uh we would like to open the QA session. Mai Yes, thank you for uh thank you for uh waiting. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please send up through the Zoom chat. We will read and answer them in the order received. Also ple,ase make sure your name and company are adequately displayed to introduce you to the audience. Please lower your hand once your question is answered. Should any participant need assistance, send a chat message or break your hand. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Fred McCann from Bank of America. How much additional upside do you see in Gas over the next few years? To what extent could this be held or limited by transportation capacity? Hi Frank and thank you for uh joining us in in the call. Um we believe that uh uh that the um transportation capacity going out from the Neukina basin will be uh almost uh completely full next next winter. So uh as we have been saying we we talk about this in the previous conference call, i it is crucial for the country to increase uh its infrastructure, its transportation capacity uh from the Pina Basin to to Buenos Aires or to the centre of the country. Uh and the government is fortunately working on on on on that project. We hope it will be uh launched soon. But we have no uh clarity on when uh will that happen. But definitely the country um in order to continue increasing the gas production at the Neuquinia basin, um there is a need to build uh new infrastructure uh new infrastructure. And this makes a lot of sense for the country because with this new pipeline, the country will be replacing uh extensive imports that we do uh gas from Bolivia that cost around double from uh what the local producers producers are uh are receiving. Um we will uh import less L and G which cost at least uh four or five times uh more expensive and we are also importing uh during the winter um diesel oil and and fuel oil. So n needing for all these imports um dollars that are scary scarce in So um regarding the additional lab sites for for a company like us, uh until this new pipeline uh it's uh constructed it it could come from exports to to Chile and now that the transportation capacity out of the Nokina basin is completely full uh it makes sense to allow uh firm exports uh to Chile um on a on a the on a um not only on on the summer months but throughout the uh the year. I I think that that will be the next step of of growth uh for the industry. So and and going to to numbers, uh because of what we have committed on the on the third round, uh our growth on winter of twenty twenty two Pisa B this winter will be roughly about thirty percent. So next winter we will be delivering eleven millions of cubic meters of natural gas per day starting in May. Uh V is an average of eight point five million cubic meters of of gas per day that we deliver this winter. This winter we have been uh ramping up started uh starting uh at seven and ended in September at nine point five. Unfortunately uh originally we were thinking that uh our production was going to slow down during the summer months, but thanks to uh the exports of electricity that the country is doing to to Brazil, We are able to maintain the the production. So we we currently are uh selling the same level that we of gas that we sold during the winter and we are keeping a plateau of nine point nine point three, nine point five million cubic meters of uh gas per day. And we think this uh situation um will stay throughout the the summer and probably until next May when our the our production will jump again to uh eleven million. Thank you, Rules. Our next question comes from Ezequiel Fernandez from Balias. His first question is about uh results were great on the oil and gas side, um, but lifting costs have been increasing as of late. At six dollar per barrel uh per barrel, this is almost one dollar per barrel versus one year ago. Is this related to the production rumpo? Perhaps cost surges related to global supply chain? How should we think about this going forward? There is a second question, but let's answer the first one. Hi, Ezekiel, how are you? So basically yes, it's uh it's an important increase in our production, that's why there's more fixed costs. And also we uh this is the first year of the Pung gas, so it's uh and and last year we did nothing. It was totally uh no activity compared to this year. And then there's uh a lot of increases in in salaries and wages. So in real terms in dollars it's a an increase. And the second question is very related to the first one. Also, are you perceiving cost increases on grips and drilling equipment that you should be using next year, or are you already constructive for that? We uh uh we we are already contracted and we've seen a slight increase uh uh in cost, but nothing out of normal. Thank you. Thank you, Rules. Uh our next question comes from Alejandra Aranda from Itahu. It's very related to the first question of Frank. Could you give us an update of what you're seeing in the gas market and bottlenecks to further develop the segment and timing of next plan gas rounds or further alternatives that you could explore to continue increasing volumes or should we view the eleven millimeters per day on winter at steady state for the near future? Could you share development costs and what IRR cost are you using for a for new projects. Well mm, well it's uh it's that's uh we should be viewing it it depends. I wef get um the the new pipeline, the new main pipeline that the the government is pushing a lot to to make it happen. We could see by twenty twenty three I always say twenty twenty four, given the timing of of building, but uh a a better and higher winter production uh by twenty twenty four. You see you saw in the in the presentation we expects to get eleven million by twenty twenty two, but in order to increase on that we are still link depends on the expansion in the main pipeline. What do you think about that, Gustavo, about the bottom eggs? The reason why we were so aggressive in this third round is is because we we under two things. But one is that we understand that uh until the the new pipeline is working, the the gas market from the Leukina basin will be very much constrained. That's why we wanted to be uh aggressive uh here. The second reason why we were very aggressive is because of the quality uh of our portfolio. Um and the reason why we are so competitive and we have the not comfortable giving uh IRRs but uh uh I can tell you that um uh it's comfortable uh IRR expectation that that we have. But our portfolio uh we are still able to continue developing shale um tight gas reserve instead of uh shale gas. Most of our uh colleagues in the industry in order to uh to maintain production or to growth or or to slightly growth its production has been going after uh or developing shale shale gas while we have the fortune of uh of having within our portfolio still uh good reserves of tight gas uh which are favorable in in economic terms vis a vis uh vis a vis saying. That's why we have we've been so aggressive. So going forward after the growth that we will have in in twenty twenty two and until new um and new infrastructure is built, the only chance to continue growing, as I said, is through exports uh to Chile. Thank you. Our next question comes from Constantino Papalias from Puente. Good morning and congratulations on the result, thank you. Could you share your expectations on the edit impact by the maturity of the one hundred and eighty megawatt PPAs of Loma della Latta? Hi Constantino. So there's two PPAs that mature this year. One very small, uh Kirena in July of this year, and then the big one, uh Loma de Lata combined performer basis, it's uh sixty million dollars uh per year of decrease. So they will be billing around fifteen million dollars per year of E of V TA um as we speak. Going forward, I mean spot energy. Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from uh Guillermo Levi from Morgan Stanley. I want you to understand the current appetite uh for to advance in new MA in EMT. If the company could take advantage of the current macro environment to expand its shale lake range at a more attractive valuation, even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. Sorry. I wanted to understand the current appetite to advancing new MA opportunity in EMP. If the company could take advantage of the current macro environment to expand its shale acreage at a more attractive evolution, even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. I would say that we we are very comfortable with the gas reserve and the portfolio on on on natural gas that that we have and we don't need to increase uh those reserves. Uh it could be different on the on the all sides. We uh as has always been in our history and continues to be, we are always uh searching for for opportunities. Nothing has nothing concrete has has materialized um but we're still looking for for opportunities on the all all side um oil research um uh in Argentina. Thank you Gros. Uh there is one question about M and A from Michael Shen uh is very related to to the last one. Uh what opportunities to invest or acquire gas related assets given the improving outlook. Is the probability of the new pipeline increasing uh based on support from an interest from an interest of the IMF. No, uh I I think that the the part of the UMA I already answered. We we are not look uh it doesn't make sense uh for us uh to increase our portfolio of uh natural gas. Uh not not even if the the the pipeline is uh built and we can significantly increase our production. We we have uh um we have reserves of excellent quality um probably the most um competitive on the of the Neukina basing. So we we don't see a need to to increase our portfolio there. Um regarding the D IMF I have n no clue what the IMF uh the things about this but I would say that uh it's so obvious that uh it was helped the the macro of Argentina the the the cost of building this pipel pipeline will be repaid uh almost immediately, probably in a year, year and a half, two years. Obviously we it will depend on what the uh at what price um the win winter gas is sold in Argentina and what what is the import parity that we will be replacing. But I'm sure uh uh and uh within current um pricing gets repaid uh very very quickly so uh although I I cannot tell you for sure I would say that the the to anyone that analyzes the situation it's it's an obvious it's very obvious that Argentina needs to to Thank you, Goose. Our next question comes there was another question from Ezequiel Fernandez from Balance. The second question is related to the cash position. With the twenty twenty two cash flow also expected to be pretty good, what are you thinking about cash use cash uses regarding buyouts, the twenty twenty three bonds or possible investment during the next year? Regarding our cash position we have first we'll be increasing our uh investments within our uh uh our core businesses so in order to uh increase our gas production by thirty percent ne ne next year. That that is a significant um capex that we will be doing. We will also we hope to as as Lila uh s said we we are eager to expand our um uh wind farm uh trepe tres by we are deciding between sixty to eighty megawatts of uh of capacity uh and started construction uh as soon as possible. Um and and regarding repurchase of our own uh assets, you know that we do that on a opportunistic um situation so uh if if there is an opportunity to repurchase our our own debt or uh our own shares we would probably go back to that. We have been we have not been doing so uh recently because because of the uh the price the because both our debt and our shares have has been recently uh going up. So we we've stopped repurchase of shares and we haven't been repurchasing uh our own debt for for a while. But we might presume at any time if there is an opportunity. Thank you, Gulf. Our next question comes from Anne Millen from Bank of America. She has two questions. The first one, you commented there was a temporary price increases for some thermal capacity between September and May and linked with exports by CAMESA. Can you tell us more about this quiz and this is not only for thermal it's also for hydro. Yeah it was just uh published um um a few days ago and it's two things. Um for the um legacy capacity in in power generation uh machines that had a low dispatch uh were were not collecting the full price of capacity. They were collecting uh if I'm not wrong seventy percent of the the full price of capacity because of their low dispatch. Sixty six sixty percent of the of the price of the capacity. Um what they have uh eliminated this uh reduction factor so and they did it on um let's uh retroactive retroactive since September. So from September to to May this reduction in the price of capacity has uh disappeared. That in our case it helps our uh Central Thermica Güemes in the north and central Piedra Buena in the south of the province of Buenos Aires which are steam turbines that have low low dispatch. That roughly to give you an idea, uh has a one one point two million dollars per month of uh of additional uh revenues. And the other news was this new fund uh related to export of electricity to to Brazil and uh as long as camisa continues uh and we feel that it will continue throughout all the the summer and into uh until next May, exporting electricity to Brazil. Part of that profit is shared with the uh legacy capacity. So um I think it's ten dollars per uh megawatt hour that is that goes to this fund and uh and the fund is shared among the uh the units that have dispatched energy during during that month. And for example for us in the m month of September that that was an additional one point two million dollars of of revenues. So in total both these um the these two these new um these two new regulatory changes added uh in September two point five million dollars uh of revenues. Thank you, Goose. Our second question from Anne Nyune is uh 2022 outlook. Uh let me mention that we don't give any guidance. Uh we can give you uh what we have in the budget. The question is, what are your current CapEx forecasts for new ye for next year. How do you expect the power and oil and gas market to evolve next year to the extent it is possible to provide any comment com any commentary? Hi Ann, how are you? So this year has been a a very uh interesting year. Next year we expect to maintain a little bit lower uh the the EMP capex. Uh EMP this year is forecasted to end at around two hundred million dollars. Next year it's uh it's we'll be close to that but a little bit lower because a lot has been done this year, that's the first year of Plan Gas. Uh power generation will remain very similar uh a little bit higher. This year was forty million dollars. Next year we are expecting to do only sixty. This is just maintenance. Uh there's no expansions in this and this is not including Barragan. And that's it. It's uh compare this year total is uh two hundred and fifty million dollars more or less, of Capalex. And next year we are expecting something a little bit lower than that, but pretty similar. Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from Florencia Majorga from MetLise. After impressive deliberate deliberating, what's next for Pampa? Do you expect to keep leverage below one point five times on a consistent basis? Okay, so the answer would be no. In general term terms we feel comfortable below two point five X but if there are some opportunities for investment in the upcoming years, uh that ratio could could increase a little bit. Thank you, Nico. Our next question comes from Carolina Carneiro from Craig Suisse. Uh this is related to the legacy remuneration uh in addition to the transit transitionary uh remuneration we got uh this this month. Uh do we ha do we have any updates for price adjustment scheme for legacy capacity generation? Any views on generation dispatch you can share for next quarters given hydro situation in Latin America and possible impacts from La Niña. uh regarding uh remuneration of our legacy capacity will be all until next uh February. That is when uh then the next February we should be getting the price adjustment as remember this year we've got a twenty nine percent increase, it was slightly below twenty twenty inflation. Uh we think that this February we will be collecting something similar to twenty twenty one uh inflation. That that's what I I think is most probable scenario, but uh it's personal expectation. There's no guidance from from the regulator. Thank you, Boose. Our next question uh is an additional question from Alejandra Aranda from Bank uh Itau. Follow up, how much do you believe we could export to Chile and what kind of prices are you getting? Okay. We we we are currently exporting uh one point five million cubic meters of natural gas per day to Colbum uh that's on a firm basis and then um interrumpible how do you say interrup uh Yeah, it's spot gas. We are selling around uh an additional in average it changes every it changes every day but a around half a million uh cubic meter of of gas, additional gas. So between between one point eight to two million cubic meters of natural gas per day is what we are currently selling to to Chile. Uh ex expectation going forward but uh it's not gonna happen until the probably the next spring in Argentina could be to to double those those exports. But eh it's not something that will have would happen in the in the short term. That we are at full production capacity these days. And until May of next year we we are almost at full capacity of production. Thank you, Booth. Uh please hold while we poll for more questions. Oh ye next question comes from Liliana Yang uh from HSBC. Could you please disclose Copex plans through business segment? Keep in mind that this is not a guidance, uh this is the latest uh budget that we have. Hi Lily, how are you? So um because some people are saying that big room here this part. Basically this year we are ending two hundred and fifty million dollars of CapEx. This is at the restricted group, two hundred from from EMP. Next year um we are uh estimating something a little bit lower than that. It's around a hundred and and eighty ninety. Not very uh different from this year, but a little bit lower. Our generation is a little bit higher. This year was forty million dollars of maintainance maintenance capex. Remember that we ended all our expansions in the restricted group next year. There's some special maintenance capex that we have to do, so we will ramp up from forty to sixty. And then the rest is very small. This is just a PEC ten. So overall, this year two fifty, next year around to forty, around those levels. Very similar, but lower. Thank you, Lila. Please follow the poll for more questions. Our next question and final one is from Alonso Mesa from Larrain. How do you feel about your current netback level? Should we expect further deterioration of the listing cost? No, we we we we are not expecting a further deterioration of the listing costs and we are comfortable as shown by the aggressiveness uh in the last uh round of the plant gas bidding. We are very comfortable with the netback levels that that we have in in the natural gas system. Thank you, Goose. Um this concludes the QA session. I uh we will turn to Lira for final remarks. Well thank you so much for joining us uh in this exciting quarter. Goose, Gabby, Nico, would you like to make some remarks? Gabby, some words? Well hi everybody. Uh just to say goodbye as Gustavo mentioned. Uh it has been very great eighteen years uh in this position and um I'm I I am stepping down only on my executive uh function but I will stay in in in the board so it's also a great honor for for me.

To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'll now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Diego Halone. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings press release and the presentation for today's call, both of which were distributed yesterday after market close. Joining me on the call this morning will be Sergio Feifman, our CEO and Vice President of the Board of Directors, and our CFO, Marco Gradin. Both of them will be available for the QA session. Before I turn the call over to Sergio, I would like to make the following safe harbour statements. Today's call will contain forward looking statements and I refer you to the forward looking statements section of our earnings release and recent filing with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances. This conference call will also include discussion on non gap financial measures, the full reconciliation to the corresponding financial measures is included in the earnings press release. Now I would like to turn the call over to Sergio. Thank you, Diego. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. As usual, I'm going to mention a few highlights of the third quarter and then Marcos will we through our market review and financial results. After that, I will provide some final remark and then we will open the code to your question. As you could see from our release used yesterday, we are pleased to share our third quarter results where we observe solid demand in high historic figures as we keep our core business margin at world class level. We encourage that the strong momentum experience in cement sales since the start of the recovery in mid twenty twenty has reached level almost of the two seen in record industry years. Our high efficient production, standard enabled, as to delivery another robust quarter, despite the impact of the normalization of operation and the subsequent effect of regular stationary maintenance cost and the higher energy input in our assessment EVDA margins. Despite these effects, when measured in US dollar, our assessment EVDA increased to fifty one million, from forty eight million in third quarter twenty twenty, even improving the result from last quarter, keeping the US dollar per ton above thirty dollars. Finally, regarding the expansion project of La Mali, we are delivering cement to the market and already seeing promising result from the first production budget. We expect to show its benefits in the coming quarters. I will now hand off the call to Marco Gradin, who will view through our market review at Financial Results. Please Marcus, go ahead. Thank you, Sergio. Good day everyone. As you can see on slide four, leaving behind the deep drops of GDP in two thousand twenty, we saw a sharp recovery in the second quarter and an improvement in twenty twenty one GDP estimated growth reaching eight point three percent. Construction activity measured by the ISAC also had a strong performance in recent months, starting to present a more moderate growth, as third quarter of Auto 20 showed the start of the post-pandemic recovery. Regarding cement national industry sales, they had kept on growing strongly, even above our previous expectation, consolidated in high figures with ten months accumulated volumes almost reaching industry's year record. Less than 1% down from the same period of 2017. Although we do not see large private infrastructure projects, Bulk has recovered mostly on the back of smaller projects. So when breaking down the consumption by dispatch mode, we absorb figures in line with historical pre-pandemic average. Certainly the economy as a whole still faces different challenges, particularly on the macroeconomic outlook that may impact our future growth expectations. Turning on to slide five for a review of our top line performance by segment. Consolidated revenues increase year on year by eight point five percent, mainly reflecting the continuous recovery of the other segments, more affected by the pandemic restriction and the growth of our core segment business. Cement, masonry cement, and lime segment was up 2.4% with volumes expanding 8.4% with softer pricing dynamic. Concrete and aggregates show sharp revenues recovery of one hundred seventeen percent and forty seven percent year on year, respectively. As we mentioned before, these segments suffer more deeply the effects of the pandemic restrictions. In the case of concrete volume expansion of 111% was underpinned by a positive pricing recovery in performance. Regarding aggregates, the segment volume was up 7.2%, boosted by a recovery in pricing and a positive pricing mix. Finally, railroad revenues increased by 25.4% in this quarter versus the same quarter in 2020enty as the high transported volumes were coupled with a good pricing performance and a positive product mix. Moving on to slide seven. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter slightly declined zero point one percent year on year, with margin contracted by two hundred twenty two basis points, mainly impacted by the dominization of seasonality cost and higher energy inputs. Seven gross margin contracted by five five hundred seventy seven basis points from thirty five point five percent to twenty nine point eight percent, with the comparison affected by regular add on maintenance cost this quarter against the fourth quarter of twenty twenty with a maintenance schedule affected by the pandemic restriction. We also experienced some pressure and from seasonal energy charges as winter production in 2020 was abnormally low due to the sharp drop in the month of last year. For the next year, the brand new line built in La Mali plant will give us the flexibility to maximize production out of the winter months, avoiding higher energy charges. SGNA expenses as a percentage of revenues remain almost flat, decreasing by five basis points to seven point six percent from seven point seven percent, value due to cost illusion from higher sales volume. Please turn to slide eight. Our adjusted DBTA was down nine point one percent in the quarter, reaching four point seven billion pesos we've consolidated the Vita margin contracted by five hundred twelve basis points to twenty-six point four percent, mainly explained by a lower segment segment adjusted the BTA and the impact of the recovery of the other excitement, which as they have lower margins, contributed negatively to the consolidated margin. In a nine-month basis, the Justed BTA margin expanded 55 basis points to 30.7%. When measured in US dollars, our third quarter VITA reached $51 million, up 6.5% from 48 million in the same quarter a year ago, and sequentially. Seminar segment adjusted the BTA margin contracted by four hundred eighty four basis points to twenty nine point five percent, mainly due to the impact of regular seasonality maintenance and winter energy cost, coupled by a softer pricing dynamic, partially offset by the increasing sales volume. In a per-ton basis, a BTA remains at a top notch level of $30. Concrete adjusted ABTA increased $42 million pesos compared to first quarter 20, explained by a recovery in sales volume and a positive price performance, yet margins remained at negative 4.0%. Aggregates adjusted FTA improved sharply from negative sixty-four million pesos in first quarter twenty to one million pesos in first quarter twenty-one, with margin of zero point three percent as better pricing mix and volumes at weighted cost increase. Finally, railroad adjusted BDA improved 34 million pesos to 110 million pesos for the quarter, with margin expansion from 6.3% to seven point three percent main explained by high gate transported volume, positive product mix and good pricing performance. Moving on to the bottom line on slide ten. Our profit before tax stood at two point six billion pesos with the comparison to third quarter twenty, affected by an extraordinary result in such quarter. Total finance cost stood at zero point three billion pesos in third quarter twenty-one compared to a net gain of three point one billion pesos in third quarter twenty, due to an extraordinary result in foreign exchange gain of three point one billion pesos. During that quarter. Guided net monetary position was zero point three billion in first quarter twenty one compared to zero point two billion in first quarter twenty. As a result, our net final expense increased by seventy nine million pesos to zero point three billion compared to the same quarter of last year, driven by lower effects depreciation effect compared to the evolution of the inflation rate. Finally, during the quarter, we recognize a non-cash impairment of Sierras Valle's asset facility of 131 million pesos due to its obsolescence and the future higher efficient production scheme of Loma. Moving on to the balance sheet, as you can see on slide eleven, we ended the quarter with a cash position of four point three billion pesos and a total debt of four point zero billion pesos. Consequently our net debt JA ratio stood at minus zero point zero two times compared to zero point sixteen times at the end of twenty twenty. In Faircore twenty one, we reduce our debt in sixteen million US dollars, standing at forty million, eighty three percent of which is denominated in US dollars. Additionally, as we continue with our third share repurchase program, we acquire share for a total amount of 600 million pesos in the quarter. Our operating cash generation stood at 5.4 billion pesos with a positive seasonal working capital effect. Regarding capital expenditures, we spent one point five billion pesos, of which were dedicated to the Mali expansion project. As the second line is already delivered cement, the capital requirements are almost completed. Now for our final remarks I would like to handle the call back to Sergio. Thank you, Marcos. Now to finalize the presentation, I please ask you to turn to slide thirteen. To wrap up, I would like to highlight the strong evolution of the cement demand. With accumulate volume until October almost reaching industry record. Even through, we expect this trend to continue in the forthcoming quarter, with remain caution through the medium term, as Argentine faced macroeconomic and political challenges that could affect the evolution of the economic activity. Regarding our new line at La Mali, we are glad about the advance in the project as we are already delivering cement to the market. We are enthusiastic with the preliminary results and expect to start seeing the operational efficiency and economic benefit in future quarters. Furthermore, this additional capacity will allow us to minimize production in winter, avoiding the sessionally higher energy impact. and also reducing the need for solid fuel that leads to a more environmentally friendly energy matrix. Natural gas will remain our main source of thermal energy. We continue to work analyzing alternatives for the near future to support a sustainable growth path for Loma Negre, underpinned by our highly efficient operation, standard and solid capital structure. Last but not least, I would like to thank all our people and stakeholders for the commitment to Loma Negra operational excellence, without whom this set of solid results would have been much harder to achieve.

So uh for the uh therefore for the next month we are uh optimistic uh regarding the housing uh demand, uh residential demand y comenzara salida infrastructure. And to start some uh infrastructure projects which has been approved uh to start ramping up uh in the next future. Thank you. I was just wondering if you can comment uh on whether the quarry is supplying limestone normally to Loma Negra and and if you have seen any stop of supply of our materials in the in the area or whether this is just operating at at a normal capacity. Thank you. El conflicto puntual de Ahoma fue con el con nuestro proveedor de la cantera de Olavarría. So the conflict in Olavarria with with Fueron por una diferencia menores de de criterios los cuales fueron solucionados. uh it was regarding a a small difference of criteria which has been solved already uh n no es este ilógico pensar que que puede haber otros conflictos pero le la compañía está está preparada para poder soportar esos prepared to to to deal with this kind of conflicts uh más allá de la parada de los hornos por por dos o tres días no no hemos perdido una tonelada de venta en ninguno de los conflictos que hemos tenido en Olavarrillo.

As you could see from our release yous- yesterday, we are pleased to share our third quarter results, where we observe solid demand and high historic figures as we keep our core finance margin at world-class level. inaudible the strong movement experienced in cement sales since the start of the recovery in mid 2020 has reached level most equivalent of the- those seen in record industry years. Our high efficient production standard enabled us to delivery another robust quarter. Despite the impact of the normalization of operation and the subsequent effect of regular seasonality maintenance cost and the higher energy input in our ISAC and EBITDA margins. Despite these effects, when measured in US dollar, our ISAC and EBITDA increased to 51 million from 48 million in third quarter 2020, even improving the result from last quarter, keeping the US dollar per ton above $30. Finally, regarding the expansion project of L'Amali, we are delivering cement to the market, and already seeing promising result from the first production budget. We expect to show its benefits in the coming quarters. I will now hand off the call to Marcos Gradin, who will lead you through our market review and financial results. Please, Marcos, go ahead. Thank you, Sergio. Good day everyone. As you can see on slide four, leaving behind a deep drops of GDP in 2020, we saw a sharp recovery in the second quarter, and an improvement in 2021 GDP estimated growth, reaching 8.3%. Construction activity measured by the ISAC also had a strong performance in recent months, starting to present a more moderate growth, as third quarter to 2020 showed the start of the post-pandemic recovery. Regarding cement national industry sales, they had kept on growing strongly. Even above our previous expectation. Consolidated in high figures, with 10 months accumulated volumes almost reaching industry's year record, less than 1% down from the same period of 2017. Although we do not see large private infrastructure projects, purchases recur mostly on the back of smaller projects. So, when breaking down the consumption by dispatch mode, we observe figures in line with historical pre-pandemic average. Certainly, the economy as a whole still faces different challenges, particularly on the market economic outlook that may impact our future growth expectations. Turning on to slide five for a review of our top-line performance by segment. Consolidated revenues increased year on year by 8.5%, mainly reflecting the continued recovery of the other segments more affected by the pandemic restrictions and the growth of our core seven business. Seventh measure inaudible on line segment, was up 2.4% with margins expanding 8.4% with softer pricing dynamic. Concrete and aggregates show sharp revenues recovery of 117%, or 47% year on year, respectively. As we mentioned before, these segments suffer more deeply the effects of the pandemic restrictions. In the case of concrete volume expansion of 111%, was underpinned by a positive price in recovering performance. Regarding aggregates, the segment volume was up 7.2%, boosted by recovering pricing, and a positive pricing mix. Finally, regular revenues increased by 25.4% in this quarter, versus the same quarter in 2020, as the higher transported volumes were coupled with a good price in performance and a positive product mix. Moving on to slide seven. Consolidated growth profit for the quarter slightly declined, 0.1% year on year, with margin contracted by 222 basis points, mainly impacted by the demonetization of seasonality cost and higher energy inputs. Seventh growth margin contracted by five- 577 basis points from 35.5% to 29.8% with the comparison affected by regular inaudible maintenance cost this quarter against the third quarter of 2020, with the maintenance schedule affected by the pandemic restrictions. We also experienced some pressure and… from seasonal energy charges as winter production in 2020 was abnormally low, due to the sharp drop in demand in last year. For the next year, the brand new line built in L'Amali plant will give us a flexibility to maximize production out of the winter months, avoiding higher energy charges. inaudible expenses a percentage of revenues remain almost flat, decreasing by five basis points to 7.6% from 7.7%, mainly due to cost inaudible from higher sales volume. Please turn to slide eight. Our adjusted EBITDA was down 9.1% in the quarter, reaching $4.7 billion pesos with consolidated EBITDA margin, contracted by 512 basis points to 26.4%, mainly explained by lower a seventh segment adjusted EBITDA and the impact of the recovery of the other segments. Which, as they have lower margins, contributed negatively to the consolidated margin. In a nine-month basis, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 55 basis points to 30.7%. When measured in US dollars, our third quarter EBITDA reached 51 million dollars, up 6.5% from 48 million in the same quarter a year ago, and sequentially. Seventh segment adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 484 basis points to 29.5%, mainly due to the impact of regular seasonality maintenance and winter energy costs, coupled by a softer price in dynamic, partially offset by the increase in sales volume. In a inaudible basis, EBITDA remains at a top-notch level of $30. Concrete adjusted EBITDA increased 42 million pesos compared to third quarter ' 20, explained by a recovery in sales volume and a positive price performance, yet margins remained at -4.0%. Aggregate adjusted EBITDA improved sharply from -64 million pesos in third quarter ' 20, to one million pesos in third quarter ' 21, with margin of 0.3% as better price and mix in volumes outweighed cost increase. Finally, regular adjusted EBITDA improved 34 million pesos, to 110 million pesos for the quarter, with margin expansion from 6.3% to 7.3%, mainly explained by higher transported volume, positive product mix, and good pricing performance. Moving on to the bottom line on slide 10. Our profit before tax to the 2.6 billion pesos was a comparison to third quarter ' 20, affected by an extraordinary result in such quarter. Total final cost stood at 0.3 billion pesos in third quarter ' 21, compared to a net gain of 3.1 billion pesos in third quarter ' 20, due to an extraordinary result in foreign exchange gain of 3.1 billion pesos during that quarter. Again, on that margin, our position was 0.3 billion in third quarter ' 21, compared to 0.2 billion third quarter ' 20. As a result, our net final expense increased by 79 million pesos to 0.3 billion pesos, compared to same quarter of last year, driven by lower effects of recession effect, compared to the evolution of the inflation rate. Finally, during the quarter, we recognized a non-cash internment of Sierra Bayas asset facility of 131 million pesos, due to its obsolescence and the future higher efficient production scheme of Loma. Moving on to the balance sheet. As you can see in slice 11, we entered the quarter with a cash position of 4.3 billion pesos, and a total debt of 4.0 billion pesos. Consequently, our net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at -0.02 times, compared to 0.16 times at the end of 2020. In third quarter ' 21, we reduced our debt in 16 million US dollars, standing at 40 million, 83% of which is eliminated in US dollars. Additionally, as we continue with our third share repurchase program, we acquired shares for a total amount of 600 million pesos in the quarter. Our operating cash generation stood at 5.4 billion pesos, with a positive seasonal working capital effect. Regarding expenditures, we spent 1.5 billion pesos for the fix, of which was dedicated to L'Amali expansion project. Uh, the second line is already delivering cement. The capital requirements are almost completed. Now for our final remarks, I would like to hand the call back to Sergio. Thank you, Marcos. Now to finalize the presentation, I please ask you to turn to slide 13. To wrap up, I would like to highlight the strong evolution of the cement demand. With accumulated volume until October, our most reaching industry record, even through with stren… the strength to continue in the forthcoming quarter. We remain cautioned through the mean term, as Argentina faces macroeconomic and political changes that could affect the evolution of the economic activity. Regarding our new line at L'Amali, we are glad about the advance in the project as we are already delivering cement to the market. We are enthusiastic with the preliminary results, and expect to start seeing the operational efficiency and the economic benefit in future quarters. Furthermore, this additional capacity will allow us to minimize production in winter, avoiding the seasonality higher energy input, and also reducing the need of solid fuel, that will lead to a more environmental friendly energy matrix.

I- I have another question if I may, and this one is regarding the Olavarria quarry. I was just wondering if you can comment, uh, on whether the quarry is supplying limestone normally to Loma Negra, and- and if you have seen any stop of supply of her materials in the… in the area, or whether this is just operating at- at a normal capacity.

Uh, so it's- it's not illogical to- to foresee similar conflicts, but the company is prepared to- to- to deal with this kind of conflicts. Uh… Spanish. So with… beside the- the stop of- of our… of our production for around three days, we- we did not have any other impact on- in the Olavarria plant. Thank you very much. This was very clear.

Regarding cement national industry sales, they had kept on growing strongly, even above our previous expectation, consolidated in high figures with ten months accumulated volumes almost reaching industry's year record. Less than 1% down from the same period of 2017. Although we do not see large private infrastructure projects, Bulk has recovered mostly on the back of smaller projects. So when breaking down the consumption by dispatch mode, we absorb figures in line with historical pre-pandemic average. Certainly the economy as a whole still faces different challenges, particularly on the macroeconomic outlook that may impact our future growth expectations. Turning on to slide five for a review of our top line performance by segment. Consolidated revenues increase year on year by eight point five percent, mainly reflecting the continuous recovery of the other segments, more affected by the pandemic restriction and the growth of our core segment business. Cement, masonry cement, and lime segment was up 2.4% with volumes expanding 8.4% with softer pricing dynamic. Concrete and aggregates show sharp revenues recovery of one hundred seventeen percent and forty seven percent year on year, respectively. As we mentioned before, these segments suffer more deeply the effects of the pandemic restrictions. In the case of concrete volume expansion of 111% was underpinned by a positive pricing recovery in performance. Regarding aggregates, the segment volume was up 7.2%, boosted by a recovery in pricing and a positive pricing mix. Finally, railroad revenues increased by 25.4% in this quarter versus the same quarter in 2020enty as the high transported volumes were coupled with a good pricing performance and a positive product mix. Moving on to slide seven. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter slightly declined zero point one percent year on year, with margin contracted by two hundred twenty two basis points, mainly impacted by the dominization of seasonality cost and higher energy inputs. Seven gross margin contracted by five five hundred seventy seven basis points from thirty five point five percent to twenty nine point eight percent, with the comparison affected by regular add on maintenance cost this quarter against the fourth quarter of twenty twenty with a maintenance schedule affected by the pandemic restriction. We also experienced some pressure and from seasonal energy charges as winter production in 2020 was abnormally low due to the sharp drop in the month of last year. For the next year, the brand new line built in La Mali plant will give us the flexibility to maximize production out of the winter months, avoiding higher energy charges. SGNA expenses as a percentage of revenues remain almost flat, decreasing by five basis points to seven point six percent from seven point seven percent, value due to cost illusion from higher sales volume. Please turn to slide eight. Our adjusted DBTA was down nine point one percent in the quarter, reaching four point seven billion pesos we've consolidated the Vita margin contracted by five hundred twelve basis points to twenty-six point four percent, mainly explained by a lower segment segment adjusted the BTA and the impact of the recovery of the other excitement, which as they have lower margins, contributed negatively to the consolidated margin. In a nine-month basis, the Justed BTA margin expanded 55 basis points to 30.7%. When measured in US dollars, our third quarter VITA reached $51 million, up 6.5% from 48 million in the same quarter a year ago, and sequentially. Seminar segment adjusted the BTA margin contracted by four hundred eighty four basis points to twenty nine point five percent, mainly due to the impact of regular seasonality maintenance and winter energy cost, coupled by a softer pricing dynamic, partially offset by the increasing sales volume. In a per-ton basis, a BTA remains at a top notch level of $30. Concrete adjusted ABTA increased $42 million pesos compared to first quarter 20, explained by a recovery in sales volume and a positive price performance, yet margins remained at negative 4.0%. Aggregates adjusted FTA improved sharply from negative sixty-four million pesos in first quarter twenty to one million pesos in first quarter twenty-one, with margin of zero point three percent as better pricing mix and volumes at weighted cost increase. Finally, railroad adjusted BDA improved 34 million pesos to 110 million pesos for the quarter, with margin expansion from 6.3% to seven point three percent main explained by high gate transported volume, positive product mix and good pricing performance. Moving on to the bottom line on slide ten. Our profit before tax stood at two point six billion pesos with the comparison to third quarter twenty, affected by an extraordinary result in such quarter. Total finance cost stood at zero point three billion pesos in third quarter twenty-one compared to a net gain of three point one billion pesos in third quarter twenty, due to an extraordinary result in foreign exchange gain of three point one billion pesos. During that quarter. Guided net monetary position was zero point three billion in first quarter twenty one compared to zero point two billion in first quarter twenty. As a result, our net final expense increased by seventy nine million pesos to zero point three billion compared to the same quarter of last year, driven by lower effects depreciation effect compared to the evolution of the inflation rate. Finally, during the quarter, we recognize a non-cash impairment of Sierras Valle's asset facility of 131 million pesos due to its obsolescence and the future higher efficient production scheme of Loma. Moving on to the balance sheet, as you can see on slide eleven, we ended the quarter with a cash position of four point three billion pesos and a total debt of four point zero billion pesos. Consequently our net debt JA ratio stood at minus zero point zero two times compared to zero point sixteen times at the end of twenty twenty. In Faircore twenty one, we reduce our debt in sixteen million US dollars, standing at forty million, eighty three percent of which is denominated in US dollars. Additionally, as we continue with our third share repurchase program, we acquire share for a total amount of 600 million pesos in the quarter. Our operating cash generation stood at 5.4 billion pesos with a positive seasonal working capital effect. Regarding capital expenditures, we spent one point five billion pesos, of which were dedicated to the Mali expansion project. As the second line is already delivered cement, the capital requirements are almost completed. Now for our final remarks I would like to handle the call back to Sergio. Thank you, Marcos. Now to finalize the presentation, I please ask you to turn to slide thirteen. To wrap up, I would like to highlight the strong evolution of the cement demand. With accumulate volume until October almost reaching industry record. Even through, we expect this trend to continue in the forthcoming quarter, with remain caution through the medium term, as Argentine faced macroeconomic and political challenges that could affect the evolution of the economic activity. Regarding our new line at La Mali, we are glad about the advance in the project as we are already delivering cement to the market. We are enthusiastic with the preliminary results and expect to start seeing the operational efficiency and economic benefit in future quarters. Furthermore, this additional capacity will allow us to minimize production in winter, avoiding the sessionally higher energy impact. and also reducing the need for solid fuel that leads to a more environmentally friendly energy matrix. Natural gas will remain our main source of thermal energy. We continue to work analyzing alternatives for the near future to support a sustainable growth path for Loma Negre, underpinned by our highly efficient operation, standard and solid capital structure. Last but not least, I would like to thank all our people and stakeholders for the commitment to Loma Negra operational excellence, without whom this set of solid results would have been much harder to achieve. We are now ready to take your question. Operator, please open the call for question. Thank you. We will now conduct a question and answer session.

Um I have two questions. I'll I'll ask the first uh I was just wondering if you can comment please on the different trends that you're seeing across the different verticals residential, infrastructure, uh formal and informal housing, if you can help us understand how that's developing as we go into the into twenty twenty two. Thank you. Speakers, you may have yourself on mute. Hi Alejandra, thank you for the question. Eh en cuanto a la tendencia para el próximo año, eh, estamos viendo en So regarding the trends for next year, we are observing similar levels with moderate growth. muchos anuncios en obras de infraestructura que están próximos a salir y que todavía no están en marcha. So uh for the uh therefore for the next month we are uh optimistic uh regarding the housing uh demand, uh residential demand y comenzara salida infrastructure. And to start some uh infrastructure projects which has been approved uh to start ramping up uh in the next future. Thank you. I was just wondering if you can comment uh on whether the quarry is supplying limestone normally to Loma Negra and and if you have seen any stop of supply of our materials in the in the area or whether this is just operating at at a normal capacity. Thank you. El conflicto puntual de Ahoma fue con el con nuestro proveedor de la cantera de Olavarría. So the conflict in Olavarria with with Fueron por una diferencia menores de de criterios los cuales fueron solucionados. uh it was regarding a a small difference of criteria which has been solved already uh n no es este ilógico pensar que que puede haber otros conflictos pero le la compañía está está preparada para poder soportar esos prepared to to to deal with this kind of conflicts uh más allá de la parada de los hornos por por dos o tres días no no hemos perdido una tonelada de venta en ninguno de los conflictos que hemos tenido en Olavarrillo. So we besides the the stop of of of our production for around three days, we we did not have any other impact on in the Olabarrilla plant. Thank you very much. This was very clear.

      "baseline" : "Good morning everyone. I'm Santiago Donato, Investor Relations Officer of Cresut, and I welcome you to the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 Results Conference Call. First of all, I would like to remind you that both audio and slideshow may be accessed through the companies' investor relations website at www.cresut.com.ar by clicking on the banner webcast link. The following presentation and the earnings release are also available for download on the company website. After management remarks, there will be a question and answer session for analysts and investors. If you want to make a question, please click the button labeled Raise Hand or use the chat. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded and that information discussed today may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's financial and operating performance. All projections are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the detailed note in the company's earnings release regarding forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Alejandro Elstein, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning everyone. We are beginning our first quarter of this year, a new campaign for Cresud. And we are planting and in very good conditions in the region, similar size of last year's, and we are going to show you a little later about the four countries and the size of plantation. We have in this year we are budgeting and we are seeing better prices than last year and higher margins compared to last year, having some bigger input costs in some like fertilizers much more bigger, but margins since comparing this year to last year are a little higher. We related to the real estate business, so remembering that we have three lines of businesses. One is the production size and the yields on the production, the second is the real estate, and the third the services in agriculture. Related to the real estate, in the first quarter we have only news in Brazil. In this quarter we have no news in Argentina and in the rest of the countries. A lot of sales in there and a lot of liquidities in in Brazil related to the real estate business. About our segment through IRSA, the urban segment, it's recovering a lot. This quarter was all open. We saw the shopping centres open, the hotels beginning to open and Shao Shao receiving a lot of the local tourism. So there is a lot of recovery and we are going to see very much better numbers in the real estate uh and their occupation is suffering something something but comparing to last year numbers they are much better. Related to the quarter of production, we were driven by the sugarcane activity. In here the that activity gave us much better results and was mainly explained by the the frozen that the country received in the winter that made a big loss in the southern regions of of Brazil and that made an increase a very important increase in the sugar cane prices, combined with the the oil prices incor increased, so the combination of the two made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugar cane, and in our case our plantations were in regions that they were not affected in production. So that combination made us a big gain, and in the others a good quarter too. Related to the oil effect on our balance sheets, we see a net gain that was mainly explained by this gross profit finan,cial result, and income tax, and there is a loss related to the fair value of IRSA, the investment properties received loss, and Matthias will explain later about this lost. Finally we had a gain of close to two billion pesos attributable to controlling shareholders. So this is the main explanation of the of the quarter. I will introduce Carlo Bluson. Okay, thank you Alejandro. Um move to the slide number three about the spectral planted area. As uh we can see in the graph this fiscal year twenty twenty two will continue on the top of the ranking for the third years in a row. The area we are planting now is two thousand two hundred and sixty two thousand hectares distributed around the four countries you can see in the graph, similar to the last year. Forty fourteen thousand in Paraguay, forty thousand in Bolivia two, a hundred eleven thousand in Brazil, and one hundred twenty-three thousand in Argentina. About the crop proje uh breakdowns, uh the crops uh this year remained the same as the last three years forty forty six percent soybean, twenty seven percent corn, nine percent sugarcane, three percent wheat, and the others produce eight percent for total of the production. Moving to the next page about farming activity, agricultural output. In the graph to the left about stock consumptions, the soybean and the corn stocks remain globally low. Having soybean about twenty seven point seven percent and corn twenty five point four percent. In case of the United States, in this graphic show you the stocks in the United States are even lower than on the rest of the world, having soybean about seven point three percent and corn ten one percent respectively. This stock consumptions have a relation above the commodity prices. In relation about that, we can see observed in the graph how prices probably went up to reaching reaching their tops in June of twenty twenty one, about soybean sixty four percent and corn one hundred and thirteen percent. However, along the following five months there was a moderate correction in the prices, dropping seventeen percent in soybean and twenty five percent thirty three percent in corn. Now the current regional head positions uh is uh in in in prices similar to budget, is in soybeans si uh five fifty six percent and in con 51% and similar prices to the budget. About climate condition and showing process. As shown in the bottom right of the graph, the climate condition in Argentina and Brazil had a recovery in comparison to the dry season of the last year. Currently, the forecast marked neutrality as the Nina moved away. Regarding the current showing process in November twenty twenty one, the total soybean is twenty three percent, Bolivia sixty four percent, Brazil forty percent, and Argentina two percent. Total in corn is thirteen percent, Bolivia ninety nine percent, Brazil thirty percent, and Argentina twelve percent. And the last one in wheat, we have a hundred percent of the planting because now we are just starting to have us in Argentina. Thank you everybody. When we go to the next page we can see what happened in the farmland cells and these two operational transactions were done in Brazil. None of them was reflected on the balance sheet because they are we are going we are putting the transactions that they of surpassing some level of payment and giving possession, and that was not accomplished on the thirtieth of September, none in the new two cases. The two cells are in two different regions, the first one Rio de Mayo that it was done in September. Productive area that we sold is two point nine thousand hectares that we bought for forty million reales and we sold for one hundred and thirty million reais in a nominal sale. Remember that in in Brazil we sell in instalments related to bags of soybeans, so when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value and we made the internal rate of return with the present value and giving us in the first case an internal rate of return in reales of fifty six percent and in the case of dollars forty percent. That was a transaction done when we did the merge with Agri Firma that we merged through paying through shares of Brasilagro and in this case, uh only selling the third of the farm will recover what we paid for the whole farm. So it was a big gain, it is a very important gain for the first quarter doing this small transaction. The second one that it will it was done in october twenty one, still not recogn recognised, and probably will be on the third thirty of december, thirty one of december. In here we are selling a productive area of two point seven thousand hectares for a total number of five hundred eighty nine million reales. This is uh bigger than the first IPO the company did, only selling two point seven thousand hectares. So a small and look at what is that price per hectare. It is depending on a present value or nominal value, thirty thousand or more or forty thousand or more reales per hectare dollars per hectare sorry. So give us the re the the reevaluation of the land in Brazil. This is a transaction that will be recognised in two steps. First step it is more than half two point five thousand one point five thousand sorry hectares of youth uh uh uh uh of productive area in the first tranche and the second tranche would be like one point one thousand hectares in twenty twenty four. So this is a uh a big transaction, uh giving us a big gain for this year and for the twenty four twenty twenty four two. And internal rate of return, this farm we bought in two thousand and seven, if I don't remember uh incorrectly. So a a long story giving us a like twenty percent in real or twelve percent in dollars, a big gain. And again when we see a farm at a three percent return, we sell it and we begin to invest it in another area or in another activity. So first semester or first quarter with activity in Brazil, but still not reflected in our balance sheets. We can move now to page number six. Um we would like to every quarter to be mentioning some of what our agricultural services are doing. Here in this page we are reflecting the two FIO and Aglofy. FIO, where Cresut Ra owns fifty And let's see what is the commercialization status. This company became the first of the country by far. Commercializing grains inputs, uh futures and options, services. So this company that today this year surpassed six point four percent and we can see the breakdown of uh what is our participation on the on the on the corn, wheat and soybeans, this company became by more than two million tons bigger than the competitors and this is making really a big gain. The E EBT evolution, we see that uh we are achieving close to fifteen million dollars record of the company coming five, six years ago, close to break even. So this company is becoming relevant to Cresut. And to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt went to the market and raised twelve. three million dollars at a zero interest rate through the local capital capital market in two years period. So this will be for investment in fixed asset and working capital. But this company is mainly employees. This year is passing more employees than Cresud. FIO is close to three hundred employees. Cresud Agriculture in Argentina is something like that. This company is is pure services to farmers from the inputs to the exports for the commodities and the specialities. This company is growing not only in Argentina, beginning its expansion in the region, going in the inputs to the rest of South America, in the output it's beginning in Brazil through FIO in Brazil. So this companies begin to be very relevant to our strategy. And on the other side in the right, we can see the evolution of AgroFi where Cresut stake is twenty percent. AgroFi expanding not only to Argentina but to Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and going to Colombia. So growing in revenues, growing the last year in eighty seven percent, beginning the first transaction of farmers in the this is the e commerce for the agriculture business and this is the big leading company in the region with annual basis of thirty one million per participants, with a lot of monthly contacts, finishing a capital raise these days, raising more capital to expand its mission, so this is becoming the marketplace of the agriculture business. So the two growing a lot in the whole region. We are seeing much more results of Result through these two companies. I will introduce now Mr Mattia. Thank you Alejandro, good morning everyone. If we move to page seven, we can see the different performance of our segments in the urban side through our participation in ERSA. Our shopping malls we are happy that for the first time in the last one year and a half we are running without restrictions. The uh all the pandemic restrictions uh were clear by the government, so now we can run on a normal uh on a normal operation. We can see that after the effect of the pandemic we have an occupancy of almost ninety percent if we leave aside the effect of Falavela that left the country, we have ninety four point three percent. The occupancy is growing quarter by quarter, so we expect to have better numbers going. forward When we see the real sales, of course when we compare with the previous year that the operation was closed, we see a ridiculous number, three hundred and twenty two percent above last year. When we compare with pre-pandemic levels, we see a real decrease of ten point seven percent. So we hope to see better numbers going forward as well. In the case of the offices, we remain with the same size of the portfolio, uh size of the portfolio with one hundred and fourteen thousand square meters. After selling some properties and with the inauguration of Catalina's building that we did during the December last year. Um the occupancy is at levels of seventy-eight point nine percent. The average rent per square meter remains stable at levels of twenty-five dollars per square meter. We see that the companies are are coming back to the offices with a hybrid modality, but our operations never close in the office portfolio. After the closing of the quarter, we announced uh a new sale of some floors at the two hundred and sixty one de la paulera building. We sold three floors for thirty two million dollars uh that we already collected all the proceeds and we are using that money to reduce the leverage of the company. Regarding the hotels, the frontiers of Argentina just opened for foreigners in November. So the hotels in the in the city of Buenos Aires were really affected by this situation. In the south of the country, since the locals are are traveling around the country. The operation in Shaoshao was very good, and we hope to see the recovery in the city of Buenos Aires going forward. One important announcement on IRSA side was the announcement of the merge or the proposal of the merge between IRSA Commercial Properties and IRSA that was announced in September. We just call for the shareholders meeting that that will take place on december the twenty two. So after this if they are if the merge is approved, Cresut will reduce the stake in IRSA from fifty s sorry, from sixty two percent to fifty four percent. This is because we will issue shares for minority shareholders of IRSA commercial properties and we will give ERSA shares. Going to the our balance sheet and the results of the quarter in page nine, we can see that we are finishing the quarter with a gain of EUR two point eight billion compared with eleven point four billion last year, attributable to our controlling interest is two billion pesos against four point four billion pesos last year. We have here several different drivers. If we see on the left side in the agri business we have uh results that are in line with the previous year. We are finishing with an operating income of two point almost two point three billion pesos and it's the the same number last year and we will see more details in the in the next page, in the urban business we are showing a loss of four point six billion against an important gain of thirty five point one billion pesos. Last year this is related to the change in the fur value. If you see in the line six, there you have the results that last year we posted again of thirty six billion pesos and this year a loss of six point four billion pesos. This is related to the macroeconomic drivers of Argentina. We are valuing our properties basically at dollar terms similar with the previous quarter, but when we convert that into pesos and then compare with inflation, inflation was at levels of nine percent during the quarter and the evaluation of the official exchange rate was only three percent or or the blue chip swap was seven percent, so that effect generates losses in pesos term in the in the balance sheet. So we can move to the next page, page ten, that here we have the breakdown of the adjusted the data by segment, we can see very good results on the agribusiness. The main difference with the previous year was the sugarcane line, line four, that this is related to better prices and better production, so in also adjusted by inflation we have a much better gain than the previous year and then in the rest of the land lines we are similar with the previous year. The first quarter is not the most relevant quarter for grains. So we will see the results going forward. In the cattle we have the effect of the inflation that prices adjusted lower than inflation, so we are recognising a loss here, but after the quarter we see a an increase in prices, so maybe we will recover in the in the following quarter. And the results of FIO, as Alejandro mentioned, that was very good result, so we we keep increasing uh the VITA of of that segment. Regarding farmland sales, all the disposals that Alejandro mentioned will be recognised in the balance sheet probably in the next quarter, part will be in steps, but we will see better results going forward. In the previous year we we have again related to the receivables, some some farms that we sold are payable at packs of soybean, so we last year because of the increasing prices we see a recovery in that line and that that doesn't happen this quarter. Regarding the urban segment, here it's more difficult to compare. We are we are comparing with an operation in the malls that was closed with uh uh during the previous year. So here you can see that last year we posted a loss. This year we are recovering with almost normal operation in terms of revenues. We will have some concessions but going forward that uh that will disappear. So we are r now running with a complete normal operation. In the case of the offices we see a stable result. Here we have different different drivers on on increasing square meters because of the La Paluera and some that we decrease because of the disposals of two buildings. And the hotels we start to see again positive numbers and sales and development during the corridor was no significant transactions. In page eleven we see the other important effect that we have in the financial statement, we have a net financial results of three billion pesos positive against a loss last year of three point nine billion pesos of lost. The reason here is basically the effects. When we see last year we have a real devaluation of zero point four percent or a nominal devaluation of eight point one percent and this quarter we have a nominal devaluation of three point two and appreciation in real terms of five point six percent that generate that when we value our debt in dollars into pesos, we are recognizing again that is in the line two in the next exchange differences. Finally, in page twelve we have the breakdown and the debt amortization schedule that remain stable compared with the previous quarter. What we did during the quarter was to issue around sixty million dollars in the local market through two different transactions. One was related to the central bank regulation that forced companies to refinance part of the debt in order to have access to buy dollars. So we did a transaction very successful in july twenty twenty one. And then in September twenty one we issue forty one point eight million dollars to refinance uh a bond that that expired in December at three point five percent interest rate that will exp will with a maturity in September twenty twenty four. So uh last week we also announced that related to our bond that expire in december twenty one, the fifth fifty three point six million dollars. We called that bond uh in advance, so we will cancel this week all the amount in order to reduce our exposure to dollars and also to reduce the leverage. So with this we finished the formal presentation. Now we open the line to receive your questions. Thank you very much. If there is a question, you can use the chat or raise hands. If there are no questions, we conclude this presentation and we turn back to Mr. Alejandro Elstein, CEO, for his closing remarks. We are beginning a very good season, big size regionally, uh having capital for buying more land in the region too, after the capital increases that we did last year and we are growing uh so we think that it's a very good momentum for agriculture on the region. Uh prices are in much better terms than in the past and uh margins are much higher. So we expect a very good season and in the combination of real estate having closed in the first quarter two big transactions give us a big uh uh really very good forecast of the annual re result for the agricultural business for the region. And in the case of the services, in the two cases, in the FIO and in the Agrify, having the capital and the group in the sa in the case of AgroFi it's a team of more than three hundred employees too. So we have the challenge of developing that e commerce on the region. So really we are very optimistic on the twenty one, twenty two numbers. So I would like to thank you everyone and deserving to everyone have a very good week. Thank you very much.",

Please refer to the little note in the companies admins release, regarding forward look in the statements. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Alejandro Elsztain CEO. Please go ahead sir. Good morning everyone. We are beginning our first quarter of first year a new campaign for Cresud. And we are planting an uh, in very good conditions in the region. Similar size of last years, and we are going to show you a little later about the four countries and the size of plantation. Uh, we, um, in this year, we are budgeting and we are seeing better prizes than last year and higher markings comparing to last year. Having some bigger input costs, in some, like, fertilizers much more bigger. Uh, but margins since comparing this year to last year are a little higher. Um, we related to the real estate business, so remember that we have three lines of businesses, one is reproduction size, and the yields on the production. The second is the real estate and the third is services in agriculture. Relating to the real estate in the first quarter, we have on news in Brazil. In this quarter we have no news in Argentina and in the rest of the countries. A lot of sales in there and a lot of liquidities in- in Brazil related to the real estate business. About our segment through Ilsa, the Yurban segment, it's recovering a lot. This quarter was all open. Uh, we saw the shopping centers open, the hotels beginning to open and the inaudible receiving a lot of the local tourism. Uh, so there is a lot of recovery and we are going to see very much better numbers in the real estate uh, and their occupation suffered something, but comparing to last year numbers, they are much better. Uh, related to the quarter of production, we were driven by the sugar cane activity and here the dark activity gave us much better research and was mainly explained by the- the frozen than the country received in the winter, that made a big lost in the southern regions of- of Brazil and that made an increase, a very important increase in the sugar cane prices combined with the- the oil prices in- increase. So the combination of the two, made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugar cane. And in our case, our plantations were in regions that they were not affected in production, so that combination made us a big gain and in the others a good quarter too. Uh, related to the m- oil effect on our balance sheet, we see a net gain, that was mainly explained by this gross profit, financial result and income tax and there is a loss related to the fair value of I- Ilsa. The investment property received a lost, and Mathius will explain later about this loss. Finally we had a gain of close to 2 billion Pesos, attributable to controlling chair-holders. So this is the main explanation of the- of the quarter. I will introduce <unk> Okay, thank you Alejandro, move to the slide number three, about the spread of inaudible Uh, we can see on the graph, this Fiscal year, 2022, we'll continue on the top of the ranking for the third years in a row. The area we are planting now, is 2000- 2000, uh, 262,000 hectors, inaudible around the full country, you can see in the graph. Similar to the last year. 40… 14,000 Paraguay, 14,000 inaudible 111,000 Brazil, and 123,000 in Argentina. About the cropters, uh, breakdowns. Uh, the crops, uh, this year remain to some of the last three years, for a- for a 6% soy bean 27% corn, 9% sugar cane, 3% wheat, and the other inaudible 8% for a total inaudible Moving to the next slide about farming activity, inaudible Uh, in the graph to the left, uh, about store consumptions, the soy bean and the corn is tout, remaining globally low, uh, having soy bean about 27.7% and corn 25.4%. In case of inaudible in this graphic, show you that there's inaudible are even lower than of the rest of the world. Having soy bean of about 7.3% and corn 10.1% respectively. This start-up consumptions, have a relation about the inaudible prices. In relation about that, we can see a- a up-surge in the graph. inaudible prices probably… previously went up to reaching- reaching the tops in inaudible 2021 uh, about soy beans, 64% and corn 113%. However, along the following five months there was a moderate corrosion in the biases drop in. 17% in Soy bean and 25% in corn. inaudible in corn. Now the current version on Hit precissions uh, is uh, in- in- in prices similar as the budget. inaudible soy beans inaudible five and 56% and in corn 51% and- and similar prices to the budget. About climate condition and showing process. It's showing the bottom ride of the graph, the climate condition of Argentina and Brazil, categorically in comparison to the inaudible season of the last year. Currently the focus mark neutrality as they inaudible move away. Regarding to the current inaudible in process, November 2021, the total soy bean is 23%, Bolivia, 64%, Brazil, 40% and Argentina 2%. Total in corn is 13%, Bolivia, 99%, Brazil 30% and Argentina 20%. And the last one wheat, we have 100%, uh, of the planting because now we are adjusting and starting to harvest in Argentina. Thank you everybody. Very good. The next page we can see what happened in the farmland sales and these two operation transactions were done in Brazil. Uh, none of them was reflected on the balance sheet, uh, because they… We are going… We are putting transactions a day of… surpassing some level of payment, and giving possession and uh, that was not accomplished on the 30 of September, in the… none in the n- two crisis. Uh, the two sales are, in two different regions. The first one, Rio de Mayo, uh, it was done in September. Uh, productive area that we sold is 2,900 hectors, uh, but we bought for 40 million Reals, and we sold for 130 million Reals in a nominal sale. Remember inaudible in Brazil, we sell in installments, relating to sa- to tax of soy beans. So when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value and we might, the internal rate of return is the… with the present value. I'm giving us in the first case, an internal rate of returning Real is of 56% and in the case of tourist 40%. That was a transaction done when we did the merge with Agrifirma that we merged through paying through shares of Brasilagro. And in this case, uh, all is telling the third of the farm will recover what we paid for the whole farm. So it was a big gain, it is a very important gain for the first quarter doing this small transaction. The second one, uh, that it will… It was done in October 21, still not recog- recognized and it probably will be on the 3rd, 30 of December, 31 of December. Uh, in here we are selling a productive area of 2,700 hectors. For a total number of 589 million Reals. This is uh, bigger than the first IPO the company did, only selling 2,700 hectors. So a small, a look at what is that price per hector, it is depending in a present value or nominal value. 30,000 or more, or 40,000 or more Reals per he- Dollars per hector, sorry. So $40,000 or $30,000 are inaudible more in the present or nominal value. So give us the rea- the- the real valuation of the land in Brazil. This is a transaction that will be recognized in two steps. Uh, first step, it is more than half, 2,500, uh, uh, 1,500, sorry, hectors of yo- uh, of productive area in the first trudge, and the second trudge will be like, 1,100 hectors in 2024. So this is a big transaction, uh, giving us a big gain for this year, uh, for the 24- 2024 too. And internal rate of return, this farm was bought in 2007 if I don't remember incorrectly. So, a- a long story, giving is a… like 20% in Reals or 12% in Dollars, a big gain. And again, when we see a farm has a 3% return, we sell it and we begin to invest it in another area or in another activity. So first semester or first quarter with activity in Brazil, but still not reflecting in our balance sheets. We can move now to page number six. Um, we would like to… ever quarter to be mentioned in some of… What our agricultural services are doing. Here in this page, we are reflecting the two field on Agrifi. Uh, field inaudible owns 50.1% And lets see what is the common satisfaction status. This company became the first of the country by far. Commercializing the grains, inputs, future inaudible services, so this company, that today, this year surpassed 6.4%, uh, we can see the breakdown of uh, what is our participation on the- on the- on the corn, wheat and soy beans. This company became, by more than 2 million tons, bigger than the competitors, and this is really making a gain the e- the EFT- EFT- EBT Evolution, we see that, uh, we are achieving close to $15 million record of the company coming five, six years ago, close to break-even, so this company is becoming relevant to Cresud. I am to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt, went to the market and raised $12.3 million at a zero interest rate, through the local capital market in two years period. So this will be for the investment in fixed asset and working capital. But this company is mainly employees, this year is passing more employees than Cresud, feel it is close to 300 employees, Chris with agriculture in Argentina is something like that. This company's is pure, services to farmers, from the input to the experts, from the commodities and the specialities. This company is growing not only in Argentina, they gaining their expansion in the region. Growning to the inputs to the rest of South America. In the outward it's beginning in Brazil, through Filho in Brazil. So this company is beginning to be very inaudible onto our strategy. And on the other slide in the right, we can see the evolution of Agrifi were pursuit stake is 20%. Agrifi not only expanding to Argentina, but Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and going to Columbia. So growing in revenues, growing the last year in 87%. They give him the first transaction of farmers in the… This is the A-commerce for the agriculture business. And this is the leading country in the region. With annual basis of 31 million per- per participants with a monthly contacts. Finishing a capital race this stage. Raising more capital to expand information. So this is becoming the marketplace of the agriculture business. So the two were in lot in the whole region. We are seeing much more result of Cresud through these two companies. inaudible hierarchy. Thank you, Alejandro, good morning everyone. If we move to page seven, we can see the different performance of our segments in the Yuban side through our participation in Ilsa. Our shopping malls, we are happy that for first time in the last one year and a half, we are running without restrictions that, uh, all the pandemic restrictions were clear by the inaudible So now we can run on the normal, uh, on the normal operation. We can see that after the affect of the pandemic, we have an occupancy of almost 90%, if we leave aside the of Valerela that left the country. We have 94.3%, the acute policy is grouwing. Quarter by quarter, so we expect to have better numbers by going forward. When we see the real sales, of course when we compare with the previous year, now the operation was closed, we see, uh, uh, a inaudible number 322% above last year. When we compare with pre-pandio- 0. So we help to- to see better numbers going forward as well. For those at the offices, we remain with the same size of the portfolio. Size of the portfolio, inaudible 114.000 square meters. After selling some properties, And with in our relation of Catalinas building, that we did during the December. The Cubans say, service levels of 77.9%. The average, rent per square meter remains stable at the levels of 25% for square metter. We saw companies are back to the officers with a inaudible morality. But our operation never close in the- in the office portfolio. Uh, after the closing of the quarter, we announced a new sail of some Florest of the 261 inaudible building. We saw three floors for $32 million, um, beut we already collected all the inaudible on the way here, are you saying that moeey who relvelas the leve. Uh, inaudiblehotels, they from inaudiblein Argentina, just opened for foreigners in November. In the city of inaudible we're really affected by this situation, in the south of the country since the local started traveling around their country, they are brave, even the inside shower was very good. And we hope to see the recover in the city of inaudible going forward. Uh, one important announcement on Ilsa side was the announcement of the merge, or the proposal of the merge that was ounch of something in September. Uh, we should call for the shareholders meeting that will take place on December 22. So after this, they are- If the merch sis approved, inaudible will reuse the stake in Urss from 62%… This is because we don't hany issuest. This is because we will issue shares for minorities shareholders of years of shats. Going to our final sheet and the results of the quarter in page 9. We can see that we are finishing the quarter with a gain of 2.8 million Peeoz compared with 11.4 billion peso last year, inaudible 2 million pesos, against 4.4 billion pesos last year. We have here several different drivers. If we see on the left side in the agribusiness, we have results that are in line with a previous year. We are finishing with an operating income of almost 2.3 million pesos and that's the same number last year, we will see more details in the- in the next page. In the Yuban business, we are showing a loss of 4.6 million pesos, against a important gain of 35.1 million pesos. Last year this is related to the change in the fur value. If you see in line six, there you have the results, that last year we posted a gain of 36 million pesos and this year a loss of 6.4 million pesos. This is related to the macro economic drivers of Argentina. We are running our properties basically at Dollar chance, similar with the previous quarter. But when we convert that into pesos and then compare with inflation, inflation was, let us hope 9% during the quarter. And the evaluation of the official exchange rate was only 3% of- or the inaudible swap was 7%. So that effect generate losses in pesos terms in the balance sheet. Um, so we can move to the next page, page inaudible that here we have the great inaudible segment. We can see very good results of the agribusiness. Um, we campaign different with the previous year, was the sugar cane line, line four. That this is related to better price, um, um, um, better production so… Also adjusted by inflation, we have a much better gain than the previous year. And then in the rest of the land… Lines, we are similar with the previous year, the first quarter is not the most inaudible on quarter for grapes, um, so we will see the results going forward. In the capital we have the fact of inflation that price is adjusted inaudible inflation so we are recognizing a loss here, but after the quarter we see a, uh, the increasing prices of a… where will we go in the following quarter. And the results of inaudible as Alejandro mentioned it was very good results, so we- we keep increasing the inaudible gap of that segment. inaudible farmer says, all that inaudible that Alejandro mentioned will be recognized in the balance sheet probably in the next quarter. But will inaudible in steps. But we will see better results going forward. In the previous year, we- we have again, related to inaudible some- some farms that we sold are payable at max of soy beans, so we, last year, also the increasing prices, we see recovery in that line and that- that doesn't happen this quarter. Regarding the Yuban segment. Here is more difficult to compare. We are comparing with an operation in the malls that was closed, uh, uh, during the previous year. So here you can see that last year we inaudible that loss. This year we are recovering, with almost normal operation in terms of revenues, we will have some concessions, but, going forward, that, uh, that will disappear, so we are now running that complete normal operation. In the case of the offices, we seeing stable results, here we have different drivers on increasing score meals, because of the inaudible and some that will increase because of the inaudible And the hotels with inaudible again, positive numbers, uh, and inaudible development during the quarter that was now significant inaudible In page 11 we see the, uh, the other important effect that we have in the financial statements. We have a net financial results of 3 million pesos positive, against a loss last year of 3.9 million pesos of loss. Um, the recent theory is basically the facts, and we see last year we have uh, real evaluation of 0.4% inaudible evaluation of 8.1% and this quarter we have a nominal evaluation of 3.2, and appreciation in real terms of 5.6%. That generate that when we value our debt in dollars into pesos, we are recognizing again, inaudible line to the next exchange inaudible Uh, finally in page 12 we have the breakdown inaudible and um, that remain stable compared with the previous quarter. What we did during the quarter was to issue around $60 million in the local market, through two different transactions, one was related to the central bank regulation that force companies to refinance part of the debt, in order to have access, uh, to buy dollars. So we did the transaction very successfully in July 2021. And then in September 21, we issued $41.8 million, uh, to refinance, uh, a bond that- that expired in December at 3.5% interest rate, that will- will… with a maturity in December 2024. Uh, last week we also announced that related to our bond that expire in December 21, the 53… $53.6 million. We call that bond, uh, in advance, so we will cancel this week, uh, all the amount in order to reduce our exposure to dollars and also to use the leverage. So with this we finish the formal presentation now, we open the line to receive your questions. Thank you very much. Thank you, nows the time for the Q and A session. If you got uh, if you have a question, you can use the- the chat, or uh, the bottom label raise hand. We will take the questions in the order we receive them. If there is a question you can use the chat, or the raise hand. If there are no questions, we conclude this presentation and we turn back to Mr. Alejandro Elsztain CEO for his closing remarks. Thank you Santi. Uh, we are beginning, uh, very good season, big size, inaudible uh, having capital for buying more land in the region too, after the capital increases that we did last year. Um, we are growing, uh, so we think that's it's a very good mine too for agricultural division. Prizes have been much better terms than in the past and the margins are much higher. So we expect a very good season, and in the combination of real estate, having closed in the first quarter two big transactions. Give us a big, really good forcast of the annual result for the agricultural business operation. And in the case of the services, in the two cases in the field inaudible having the capital and the group inaudible its a team of more than 300 employees too. So we have the challenge of developing that e-commerce in the region. So really we are optimistic on the 21-22 now. So I would like to thank everyone and deserving to everyone have a very good week. Thank you very much.",
      "withCtc" : "Good morning everyone. I'm Santiago Donato, Investor Relations Officer of Cresut, and I welcome you to the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 Results Conference Call.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded and that information discussed today may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's financial and operating performance. All projections are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the detailed note in the company's earnings release regarding forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Alejandro Elstein, CEO. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning everyone. We are beginning our first quarter of this year, a new campaign for Cresud. And we are planting and in very good conditions in the region, similar size of last year's, and we are going to show you a little later about the four countries and the size of plantation. We have in this year we are budgeting and we are seeing better prices than last year and higher margins compared to last year, having some bigger input costs in some like fertilizers much more bigger, but margins since comparing this year to last year are a little higher. We related to the real estate business, so remembering that we have three lines of businesses. One is the production size and the yields on the production, the second is the real estate, and the third the services in agriculture. Related to the real estate, in the first quarter we have only news in Brazil. In this quarter we have no news in Argentina and in the rest of the countries. A lot of sales in there and a lot of liquidities in in Brazil related to the real estate business. About our segment through IRSA, the urban segment, it's recovering a lot. This quarter was all open. We saw the shopping centres open, the hotels beginning to open and Shao Shao receiving a lot of the local tourism. So there is a lot of recovery and we are going to see very much better numbers in the real estate uh and their occupation is suffering something something but comparing to last year numbers they are much better. Related to the quarter of production, we were driven by the sugarcane activity. In here the that activity gave us much better results and was mainly explained by the the frozen that the country received in the winter that made a big loss in the southern regions of of Brazil and that made an increase a very important increase in the sugar cane prices, combined with the the oil prices incor increased, so the combination of the two made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugar cane, and in our case our plantations were in regions that they were not affected in production. So that combination made us a big gain, and in the others a good quarter too. Related to the oil effect on our balance sheets, we see a net gain that was mainly explained by this gross profit finan,cial result, and income tax, and there is a loss related to the fair value of IRSA, the investment properties received loss, and Matthias will explain later about this lost. Finally we had a gain of close to two billion pesos attributable to controlling shareholders. So this is the main explanation of the of the quarter. I will introduce Carlo Bluson. Okay, thank you Alejandro. Um move to the slide number three about the spectral planted area. As uh we can see in the graph this fiscal year twenty twenty two will continue on the top of the ranking for the third years in a row. The area we are planting now is two thousand two hundred and sixty two thousand hectares distributed around the four countries you can see in the graph, similar to the last year. Forty fourteen thousand in Paraguay, forty thousand in Bolivia two, a hundred eleven thousand in Brazil, and one hundred twenty-three thousand in Argentina. About the crop proje uh breakdowns, uh the crops uh this year remained the same as the last three years forty forty six percent soybean, twenty seven percent corn, nine percent sugarcane, three percent wheat, and the others produce eight percent for total of the production. Moving to the next page about farming activity, agricultural output. In the graph to the left about stock consumptions, the soybean and the corn stocks remain globally low. Having soybean about twenty seven point seven percent and corn twenty five point four percent. In case of the United States, in this graphic show you the stocks in the United States are even lower than on the rest of the world, having soybean about seven point three percent and corn ten one percent respectively. This stock consumptions have a relation above the commodity prices. In relation about that, we can see observed in the graph how prices probably went up to reaching reaching their tops in June of twenty twenty one, about soybean sixty four percent and corn one hundred and thirteen percent. However, along the following five months there was a moderate correction in the prices, dropping seventeen percent in soybean and twenty five percent thirty three percent in corn. Now the current regional head positions uh is uh in in in prices similar to budget, is in soybeans si uh five fifty six percent and in con 51% and similar prices to the budget. About climate condition and showing process. As shown in the bottom right of the graph, the climate condition in Argentina and Brazil had a recovery in comparison to the dry season of the last year. Currently, the forecast marked neutrality as the Nina moved away. Regarding the current showing process in November twenty twenty one, the total soybean is twenty three percent, Bolivia sixty four percent, Brazil forty percent, and Argentina two percent. Total in corn is thirteen percent, Bolivia ninety nine percent, Brazil thirty percent, and Argentina twelve percent. And the last one in wheat, we have a hundred percent of the planting because now we are just starting to have us in Argentina. Thank you everybody. When we go to the next page we can see what happened in the farmland cells and these two operational transactions were done in Brazil. None of them was reflected on the balance sheet because they are we are going we are putting the transactions that they of surpassing some level of payment and giving possession, and that was not accomplished on the thirtieth of September, none in the new two cases. The two cells are in two different regions, the first one Rio de Mayo that it was done in September. Productive area that we sold is two point nine thousand hectares that we bought for forty million reales and we sold for one hundred and thirty million reais in a nominal sale. Remember that in in Brazil we sell in instalments related to bags of soybeans, so when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value and we made the internal rate of return with the present value and giving us in the first case an internal rate of return in reales of fifty six percent and in the case of dollars forty percent. That was a transaction done when we did the merge with Agri Firma that we merged through paying through shares of Brasilagro and in this case, uh only selling the third of the farm will recover what we paid for the whole farm. So it was a big gain, it is a very important gain for the first quarter doing this small transaction. The second one that it will it was done in october twenty one, still not recogn recognised, and probably will be on the third thirty of december, thirty one of december. In here we are selling a productive area of two point seven thousand hectares for a total number of five hundred eighty nine million reales. This is uh bigger than the first IPO the company did, only selling two point seven thousand hectares. So a small and look at what is that price per hectare. It is depending on a present value or nominal value, thirty thousand or more or forty thousand or more reales per hectare dollars per hectare sorry. So give us the re the the reevaluation of the land in Brazil. This is a transaction that will be recognised in two steps. First step it is more than half two point five thousand one point five thousand sorry hectares of youth uh uh uh uh of productive area in the first tranche and the second tranche would be like one point one thousand hectares in twenty twenty four. So this is a uh a big transaction, uh giving us a big gain for this year and for the twenty four twenty twenty four two. And internal rate of return, this farm we bought in two thousand and seven, if I don't remember uh incorrectly. So a a long story giving us a like twenty percent in real or twelve percent in dollars, a big gain. And again when we see a farm at a three percent return, we sell it and we begin to invest it in another area or in another activity. So first semester or first quarter with activity in Brazil, but still not reflected in our balance sheets. We can move now to page number six. Um we would like to every quarter to be mentioning some of what our agricultural services are doing. Here in this page we are reflecting the two FIO and Aglofy. FIO, where Cresut Ra owns fifty And let's see what is the commercialization status. This company became the first of the country by far. Commercializing grains inputs, uh futures and options, services. So this company that today this year surpassed six point four percent and we can see the breakdown of uh what is our participation on the on the on the corn, wheat and soybeans, this company became by more than two million tons bigger than the competitors and this is making really a big gain. The E EBT evolution, we see that uh we are achieving close to fifteen million dollars record of the company coming five, six years ago, close to break even. So this company is becoming relevant to Cresut. And to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt went to the market and raised twelve. three million dollars at a zero interest rate through the local capital capital market in two years period. So this will be for investment in fixed asset and working capital. But this company is mainly employees. This year is passing more employees than Cresud. FIO is close to three hundred employees. Cresud Agriculture in Argentina is something like that. This company is is pure services to farmers from the inputs to the exports for the commodities and the specialities. This company is growing not only in Argentina, beginning its expansion in the region, going in the inputs to the rest of South America, in the output it's beginning in Brazil through FIO in Brazil. So this companies begin to be very relevant to our strategy. And on the other side in the right, we can see the evolution of AgroFi where Cresut stake is twenty percent. AgroFi expanding not only to Argentina but to Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and going to Colombia. So growing in revenues, growing the last year in eighty seven percent, beginning the first transaction of farmers in the this is the e commerce for the agriculture business and this is the big leading company in the region with annual basis of thirty one million per participants, with a lot of monthly contacts, finishing a capital raise these days, raising more capital to expand its mission, so this is becoming the marketplace of the agriculture business. So the two growing a lot in the whole region. We are seeing much more results of Result through these two companies. I will introduce now Mr Mattia. Thank you Alejandro, good morning everyone. If we move to page seven, we can see the different performance of our segments in the urban side through our participation in ERSA. Our shopping malls we are happy that for the first time in the last one year and a half we are running without restrictions. The uh all the pandemic restrictions uh were clear by the government, so now we can run on a normal uh on a normal operation. We can see that after the effect of the pandemic we have an occupancy of almost ninety percent if we leave aside the effect of Falavela that left the country, we have ninety four point three percent. The occupancy is growing quarter by quarter, so we expect to have better numbers going. forward When we see the real sales, of course when we compare with the previous year that the operation was closed, we see a ridiculous number, three hundred and twenty two percent above last year. When we compare with pre-pandemic levels, we see a real decrease of ten point seven percent. So we hope to see better numbers going forward as well. In the case of the offices, we remain with the same size of the portfolio, uh size of the portfolio with one hundred and fourteen thousand square meters. After selling some properties and with the inauguration of Catalina's building that we did during the December last year. Um the occupancy is at levels of seventy-eight point nine percent. The average rent per square meter remains stable at levels of twenty-five dollars per square meter. We see that the companies are are coming back to the offices with a hybrid modality, but our operations never close in the office portfolio. After the closing of the quarter, we announced uh a new sale of some floors at the two hundred and sixty one de la paulera building. We sold three floors for thirty two million dollars uh that we already collected all the proceeds and we are using that money to reduce the leverage of the company. Regarding the hotels, the frontiers of Argentina just opened for foreigners in November. So the hotels in the in the city of Buenos Aires were really affected by this situation. In the south of the country, since the locals are are traveling around the country. The operation in Shaoshao was very good, and we hope to see the recovery in the city of Buenos Aires going forward. One important announcement on IRSA side was the announcement of the merge or the proposal of the merge between IRSA Commercial Properties and IRSA that was announced in September. We just call for the shareholders meeting that that will take place on december the twenty two. So after this if they are if the merge is approved, Cresut will reduce the stake in IRSA from fifty s sorry, from sixty two percent to fifty four percent. This is because we will issue shares for minority shareholders of IRSA commercial properties and we will give ERSA shares. Going to the our balance sheet and the results of the quarter in page nine, we can see that we are finishing the quarter with a gain of EUR two point eight billion compared with eleven point four billion last year, attributable to our controlling interest is two billion pesos against four point four billion pesos last year. We have here several different drivers. If we see on the left side in the agri business we have uh results that are in line with the previous year. We are finishing with an operating income of two point almost two point three billion pesos and it's the the same number last year and we will see more details in the in the next page, in the urban business we are showing a loss of four point six billion against an important gain of thirty five point one billion pesos. Last year this is related to the change in the fur value. If you see in the line six, there you have the results that last year we posted again of thirty six billion pesos and this year a loss of six point four billion pesos. This is related to the macroeconomic drivers of Argentina. We are valuing our properties basically at dollar terms similar with the previous quarter, but when we convert that into pesos and then compare with inflation, inflation was at levels of nine percent during the quarter and the evaluation of the official exchange rate was only three percent or or the blue chip swap was seven percent, so that effect generates losses in pesos term in the in the balance sheet. So we can move to the next page, page ten, that here we have the breakdown of the adjusted the data by segment, we can see very good results on the agribusiness. The main difference with the previous year was the sugarcane line, line four, that this is related to better prices and better production, so in also adjusted by inflation we have a much better gain than the previous year and then in the rest of the land lines we are similar with the previous year. The first quarter is not the most relevant quarter for grains. So we will see the results going forward. In the cattle we have the effect of the inflation that prices adjusted lower than inflation, so we are recognising a loss here, but after the quarter we see a an increase in prices, so maybe we will recover in the in the following quarter. And the results of FIO, as Alejandro mentioned, that was very good result, so we we keep increasing uh the VITA of of that segment. Regarding farmland sales, all the disposals that Alejandro mentioned will be recognised in the balance sheet probably in the next quarter, part will be in steps, but we will see better results going forward. In the previous year we we have again related to the receivables, some some farms that we sold are payable at packs of soybean, so we last year because of the increasing prices we see a recovery in that line and that that doesn't happen this quarter. Regarding the urban segment, here it's more difficult to compare. We are we are comparing with an operation in the malls that was closed with uh uh during the previous year. So here you can see that last year we posted a loss. This year we are recovering with almost normal operation in terms of revenues. We will have some concessions but going forward that uh that will disappear. So we are r now running with a complete normal operation. In the case of the offices we see a stable result. Here we have different different drivers on on increasing square meters because of the La Paluera and some that we decrease because of the disposals of two buildings. And the hotels we start to see again positive numbers and sales and development during the corridor was no significant transactions. In page eleven we see the other important effect that we have in the financial statement, we have a net financial results of three billion pesos positive against a loss last year of three point nine billion pesos of lost. The reason here is basically the effects. When we see last year we have a real devaluation of zero point four percent or a nominal devaluation of eight point one percent and this quarter we have a nominal devaluation of three point two and appreciation in real terms of five point six percent that generate that when we value our debt in dollars into pesos, we are recognizing again that is in the line two in the next exchange differences. Finally, in page twelve we have the breakdown and the debt amortization schedule that remain stable compared with the previous quarter. What we did during the quarter was to issue around sixty million dollars in the local market through two different transactions. One was related to the central bank regulation that forced companies to refinance part of the debt in order to have access to buy dollars. So we did a transaction very successful in july twenty twenty one. And then in September twenty one we issue forty one point eight million dollars to refinance uh a bond that that expired in December at three point five percent interest rate that will exp will with a maturity in September twenty twenty four. So uh last week we also announced that related to our bond that expire in december twenty one, the fifth fifty three point six million dollars. We called that bond uh in advance, so we will cancel this week all the amount in order to reduce our exposure to dollars and also to reduce the leverage. So with this we finished the formal presentation. Now we open the line to receive your questions. Thank you very much. If there is a question, you can use the chat or raise hands. If there are no questions, we conclude this presentation and we turn back to Mr. Alejandro Elstein, CEO, for his closing remarks. We are beginning a very good season, big size regionally, uh having capital for buying more land in the region too, after the capital increases that we did last year and we are growing uh so we think that it's a very good momentum for agriculture on the region. Uh prices are in much better terms than in the past and uh margins are much higher. So we expect a very good season and in the combination of real estate having closed in the first quarter two big transactions give us a big uh uh really very good forecast of the annual re result for the agricultural business for the region. And in the case of the services, in the two cases, in the FIO and in the Agrify, having the capital and the group in the sa in the case of AgroFi it's a team of more than three hundred employees too. So we have the challenge of developing that e commerce on the region. So really we are very optimistic on the twenty one, twenty two numbers. So I would like to thank you everyone and deserving to everyone have a very good week. Thank you very much."

      "baseline" : "Good morning and welcome to the Desperate Third Quarter 21 Earnings Conference Call. A slide presentation is accompanying today's webcast and is available in the investor section of the company's website, investor.despigar.com. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today's presentation. This conference call is being recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in listen only mode. Now I would like to turn the call over to Miss Natalia Mirenberg, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning everyone and thanks for showing us today for the discussion of our third quarter twenty twenty one results. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles, we discussed certain non-gap financial measures from operating metrics, including foreign exchange user calculations. Investors should read the definition of these measures and metrics, including in our relatives carefully, to ensure that they understand them. Non-GAP financial measures and operating metrics should not be considered in isolation as substitute for or superior two gas financial measures and are provided as supplementary information only. Before we begin, our preferred remarks, allow me to remind you that certain statements made during the course of the discussion may constitute forward looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ, including factors that may be beyond the company's control. These include, but are not limited to, expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID nineteen pandemic and the integration and performance of the businesses we acquire, including the SA and COM. For the description of the team, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our press release. Speaking on today's call is our CEO, Damian Scockin, who will provide an overview of the third quarter and update you on our strategic priorities. Alberto Lopez Afini, our CSO, will then discuss the quarter's financial results. After that, we'll all we open the call to your questions. Danielle, please go ahead. Thank you, Natalia, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the spirit. Our third quarter results demonstrate that the strategic initiatives undertaken since the start of the pandemic and their successful execution are delivering improved margins when compared to twenty nineteen. Our performance this quarter underscores the future earnings power of the company. I'd like to touch on some highlights. We show strong recovery across most of our markets, mainly driven by increased demand for domestic travel. International tourism is just starting to pick up as many countries begin opening their borders to fully vaccinated tourists. Thus, our international transactions increased one hundred and twenty percent sequentially, coming from very low levels. As a result, we reported sequential increases of thirty four percent in gross booking and forty four percent in transactions. This was driven by, first of all, capturing the pickup in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, countries that were impacted in the prior quarter with the second wave of the virus. Second, another strong quarter in Colombia, where we observed significant tent up demand. Mexico was standout in the prior quarter, but had a weaker performance in July and August, and some of best day stores could not open due to the restrictions that impacted some key touristic destinations. On a positive tone, our Mexican operations began to recover in September. This has continued into October. Our geographic diversification has allowed us to capture growth across the region as market recovers. We continue to closely monitor the key levers of the company, namely price, marketing expenses and instalments. After improvements in our management revenue toolkit, we have been able to report stronger take rates than pre pandemic, reaching twelve point seven percent as reported, and thirteen point seven percent, excluding extraordinary cancellations. Similar to past quarters, our take rate benefited from the investments we have made in technology and analytics, which allowed us to price more accurately, improving algorithms to capture more profitable transactions and the positive impact from Best Day, which has a higher take rate, were also key contributors. At the same time, on a quarter on quarter basis, revenue growth was more than double the increase in cost of revenues. Lastly, operating expenses increased only three percent sequentially, even as business leverages the actions taken last year to improve profitability. This has allowed us to be very close to achieving adjusted evidently given when excluding extraordinary charges, even with gross bookings at only fifty six percent of the third quarter of twenty eighteen level. Importantly, for the month of September, we achieve positive adjusted EBITDA, excluding extraordinary charges. This was an important milestone for us. We remain well capitalised with a healthy tax position of two hundred seventy six million dollars, turning to slide four for a discussion on a few of our key markets. As various geographies have reopened post pandemic, consumers have shifted some spend towards travel and entertainment. Along these lines, Brazil and Colombia posted the highest level of cross booking since the start of the pandemic. With most states in Brazil listing restrictions in July, ROS bookings in the quarter were up one hundred and twenty six percent sequentially, and ASPs up thirty three percent in the same period. By mid September, several countries lifted restrictions allowing fully vaccinated Brazilians to travel overseas. Furthermore, as of november eighth november, fully vaccinated Brazilians are now allowed to travel to the US show improve of full vaccination. In Mexico, although borders remained open for flights, activities in main cities were particularly restricted to control and increase in COVID cases. These restrictions affected best day offline source performance in July and August. On a positive note, ROS bookings have been increasing month over months since August and international travel was stable on a sequential basis. Regarding the rest of LATAM, noteworthy Colombia was thirty two percent above the third quarter of twenty nineteen, pre pandemic levels, reflected pent up demand as travel restrictions were listed earlier in the year. In Argentina, we observed a sequential one hundred and fifty percent increase in gross bookings. Finally, in Chile, gross bookings nearly doubled sequentially, and this significant growth trend continued in October. As we entered the fourth quarter, October continued with this positive trend across the region. Just to summarize, our geographic diversification has been key in providing a more consistent overall performance for the company. Turning to slide five, we have two really strong initiatives that we continue to deliver on and that I will discuss today. First, our loyalty programme has been widely accepted and we have reached the one million member milestone. Today, as a porte especiality available in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. In this regard, we recently signed an agreement to launch a co branded credit card in Mexico in partnership with Index and MasterCard, also capitalising on increased travel demand, we launched our first offline marketing campaign since twenty twenty. It's time to travel again and can be seen across all media in Latin America. In Brazil, we have been offered more financing options to customers. With coin, we have further deepened penetration in the collar, accounting for six point five percent of all transactions in the third week of October, with a record total purchase volume. Additionally, five or five percent of the collar transactions in October were paid through PICs, which results in much lower cost of revenue for the collar given that these transactions are processed internally. We also completed implementation of risk-based pricing in the travel vertical, which allows us to match the interest rate chart to the risk profile of different customers. On Coins B2B business, we continue expanding the number of merchants in the e-commerce sector, to which we now provide the alternative means for customers to pay via boleto parasilila and by now pay later payment solutions. We now have thirty merchants signed up. We also added four new merchants in payments and fraud, bringing the total number of merchants to ten year today, notably, coin's total purchase value for the quarter tripled sequentially. As we look ahead, we expect to be adding more industries to our two verticals in the very near future. We see a very attractive potential for coin services, by now pay later and fraud prevention, which have a total addressable market of between fifteen and twenty billion dollars in Latin America. I will now turn the call over to Alberto to discuss this quarter's financial results. Thank you, Damian, and thank you all for joining us today. Turning to page six, A reSported revenues increased thirty two percent sequentially to thirty seven percent below third quarter nineteen pre pandemic levels, compared with thirty nine percent below second quarter nineteen levels in the prior quarter. Excluding extraordinary cancellations in connect in connection with the COVID nineteen pandemic, revenues would have been thirty two percent below third quarter 19 levels. Note that this quarter we also saw lower cancellations. The ratio of cancellations to gross bookings decreased 33 basis points quarter on quarter. Importantly, our take rate remains strong, reaching 12.7% as reported, and 13.7% when excluding extraordinary cancellations. Key factors in this development were the contribution from Bell Day and improvements in revenue management implemented since last year, which have allowed us to further optimize pricing through more advanced algorithms. Now please turn to slide seven. Moving on to profitability, we achieved the best quarterly adjusted EVIDA since the start of the COVID nineteen pandemic in seventh quarter twenty twenty. Despite posting growth bookings forty four percent below third quarter nineteen, we were very close to break even when excluding extraordinary charges. This is proof of the initiatives launched during this period, particularly in terms of cost reduction. Excluding extraordinary charges, comparable adjusted DB data near breakeven, reaching a loss of three point six million, improving from losses of ten and a half million in the final quarter, and nearly seventeen million in third quarter twenty twenty. This compares with a comparable adjusted dividend gain of over nine million dollars in third quarter nineteen. Note that one-time charges were nearly seven million dollars in the quarter, mainly in connection with extraordinary cancellations resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, compared to non-reentcurr charges of twelve million in second quarter twenty twenty one. We are confident that the Spegar will be coming out of the pandemic as a more profitable company, better diversified both from a geographic and product mixed perspective, backed by a more sustainable business model. Now please turn to slide eight. We closed the quarter with a solid cash position of two hundred and seventy six million dollars. As travel conditions improved, use of cash during the quarter increased to nearly 40 million. Recall that in the second quarter we had granted a higher number of vouchers to customers whose travel plans were impacted by a spike in COVID cases, mainly in Brazil. While this resulted in a lower use of cash of close to ten million in second quarter twenty one, with better travel conditions in this past quarter, we saw a pickup in demand with customers redeeming travel vouchers. The redemption of these vouchers added 15 million to the cash burn that we have been posted recently of 25 million. In turn, our net payable position decreased nearly twenty million dollars in the quarter. Now please turn to slide nine for the key takeaways of the quarter. First, we delivered a strong sequential recovery, driven by better performance across our key markets, except for Mexico Disnoted. Brazil led the recovery with gross bookings up one hundred and twenty six percent sequentially, but still sixty percent below nineteen levels. Colombia also showed a strong pend up with gross bookings exceeding third quarter nineteen levels by thirty two percent. Second, EBITDA excluding cancellations here break even, even with gross booking still forty four percent below nineteen levels. As the initiatives implemented since the start of the pandemic have significantly strengthened the earnings power of the company. This positive trend in profitability continued into September, with adjusted DP DAI reaching break even levels when excluding extraordinary cancellations. Fourth, we continue to deepen customer engagement with our loyalty program, reaching the one million member milestone in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico combined. As the money has picked up, we also launched our first offline marketing campaign since the second quarter last year. Finally, on the ESG front, we launched our materiality survey last month and look forward to sharing the results in our next ESG report. Now, please turn to slide ten for final remarks. Despite ongoing volatility and some macro murkiness, our long term vision is, if anything, a sharper focus. The initiatives required to realize it are fully underway even as we work through near-term macro challenges and consumer behavior continues to adjust. Looking at the fourth quarter, the strong recovery observed in gross bookings in September continued into October, reaching 72% of 19 booking levels. In addition, we expect November and December to continue with these positive trends, benefiting from industry marketing events such as the Buenfillment Campaign in Mexico and Black Friday in Brazil. December also marks the start of the summer season in LATAM, which would also contribute to higher demand in the region. In this context, we are stepping up our marketing efforts while keeping a heightened focus on affordability. To illustrate the point, on a weekly basis we are launching a minimum of four unbeatable deals by country while carefully balancing the price financing perception. With respect to Belday, we are on track with integration of the in-destination activity segment and expect to fully finalise the integration of this acquisition as planned by 1st autumn next year. We are also making steady headway in expanding coins acquisitions operations. In addition to adding new logos in the B2B business segment in Brazil, we're taking the first steps to launch coin in Mexico early next year. Finally, we are in conversation with several suppliers across the region to expand our vacation rental inventory to meet current higher demand in this product segment. In summary, our continued focus on execution and our improved performance to date, together with the positive progression in demand, are quite encouraging. We believe that while forecasting future performance still presents some challenges due to the ups and downs of the pandemic. We expect that the developments in vaccination front will generate the confidence to go back to normal travel patterns. The third quarter and year-to-date results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and represent focus and discipline in executing our long-term strategic plan. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star than one on your touchstone phone. If you are using a speaker phone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If your question has been addressed and you'd like to remove yourself from queue, please press star than two. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that's star than one if you have a question. And today's first question comes from Ed Yeruma with KeyBank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and nice to see the sequential improvement. I guess a couple of things for me. Um first, I think you guys have done a really good job of, you know, right size in the business during the pandemic and making yourselves more efficient. Is there a way that we should think as bookings rebuild from an incremental margin perspective and how the shape may differ than what we've seen previously? And second, um, kind of as expected, you you're gonna draw down on the cash a bit, I guess, as people redeem vouchers. How should we think about the cash usage progression over the next couple quarters and when will that trough? Thank you. to reiterate what we discussed in prior calls. I re actually re I recall your question. Okay, we are looking at the similar levels to what we have discussed, let's say like a minimum cash value for the year of around two hundred and fifty. Okay. In particular driven for the same reasons that you that you highlighted. Okay. We are uh in the trajectory that we are actually reaching break even point. Okay, we we already uh in the month of October that we are closing those figures, okay, we're seeing um uh already uh blue lines when it comes to at an EBDA level that is particularly encouraging. When you start looking at margins, let's say top to bottom, okay, we we are seeing um take rate at similar levels to to the ones we we we have been discussing. Okay, let's recall what we have mentioned in prior calls about having let's say a a long term trajectory on on take it at around uh uh twelve percent. With regards to structural cost, what we have said is that the structural cost uh should actually benefit from let's say uh uh around sixty percent uh operating leverage, meaning that if orders were to grow around a hundred, okay, structural cost shoulds be growing no more than than forty percent. And that uh I would say points to a picture uh on what could be the profitability of the company going forward, that is should be in excess of what we were discussing pre pandemic in the long run. Got it. And maybe one other follow up. Um you indicated you're looking to kind of rebuild inventory for packages given some of the demand signals you're seeing. Um I guess how quickly can that happen and do you expect that you'll be able to um to have enough kind of capacity for the peak travel seasons. Thank you. We currently see um I I think that w that answer has maybe two two two different ideas. Number one is uh the company uh um continues to be let's say on the sidelines when it comes to uh let's say securing inventory uh as we have done pre pan pre pandemic. Okay, remember that uh we were actually at around let's say five percent uh or n no uh between five to ten percent no, more than that. Uh of all the gross bookings were selling were actually uh secured or ke paid in advance on capacity at hotels uh and or airlines. Okay. Since the pandemic struck we we were completely on the sidelines of that and we are not thinking about starting to push into that arena um uh as of let's say the the next few quarters. And we do not see a reason to do it given number one uh the ups and downs of the business and number two the we see we see capacity so there's no need to do it. Okay? Of course we see that as a profitable business and that will be uh we put'll the the um um our our foot on the on on on the gas pedal uh as the we are fully recovered because we see there's there are there's opportunity to gain extra margins. But for for the time being we will not do it. In addition, Ed and in in general inventory, what we are seeing is that uh airlines are uh increasing their network significantly in Latin America for the upcoming two to three months. So everything that's uh available from the airlines and the hotel is gonna be in the spegar and we are seeing increased levels of uh of inventory on both areas. So we are confident that the pace of the recovery will be sustained over the next few months. Very good. Thanks much. And ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press start and one. Our next question comes from Kevin Koppelman with Cowan and Company. Please go ahead. Uh good morning. This is Emily on for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. Um you mentioned a new marketing campaign uh launching in Q four focused on affordability. And I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that will affect um revenue take rate installments and sales and marketing expenses in the quarter. Thanks. Hi Emily, thanks for your question. This is Damian. Um the the new campaign was uh extremely effective, it's been extremely effective though it's still running. And uh what we are pointing towards is uh getting back to travel and being able to afford the travel uh as as we always have been positioned in the minds of consumers. We do not expect that this will represent or be reflected in any lower take rates. Remember that as we mentioned during the remarks, uh we have enhanced significantly our revenue management capabilities. So we are being much more effective than in the past in increasing uh demand without having to give up uh significantly on the tech rate. So the the numbers that Alberto referred to in the previous question should be uh sustained over the next few months. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer. session I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for the final remarks. Thank you very much. And just wanted to thank all of you uh for your participation and interest in this cigar. We hope you all uh remain healthy and safe and thanks for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing you on our next call. Bye. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may not disconnect your minds and have a wonderful day.",

There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today's presentation. This conference is being recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in listen only mode. Now I would like to turn the call over to Miss Natalia Nuremberg, investor relations. Please go ahead. Good morning everyone and thanks for showing up today for a discussion of our third quarter 2021 return. In our recent reporting financial returns and performance in US, generally accepted accounting principal, we'll discuss certain longterm financial metrics and operating metrics, including for administrations and calculations. Investment secures the definition of these measures and metrics, inaudible to ensure that they understand them. Longer financial measures and operating metrics should not be considered to inaudible to the financial measures, and are provided as supplementary information only. Before we begin, I would like to remind, allow me to remind you that certain statements made in the course of the discussion will constitute correlating statements which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs, and as such you'll see a number of risks and uncertainties that the report's actual inaudible may be beyond the company's control. This includes but are not limited to expectations on our functions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the intervention and performance of the businesses we acquired during inaudible. For a discussion of this list, prefer to our filing with the securities and exchange commission and our press release. Speaking on our next call is our CEO Damian Scokin, who is inaudible on our specific priorities. Lastly, our CSO will then discuss the third quarter's financial return. After that we'll all- we'll open the call to your questions. Damian, please go ahead. Thank you, Natalia, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and your interest in Despegar. Our third quarter result demonstrates that the strategic initiatives and the stake in since the start of the pandemic, and there's a careful execution and delivery improvement in, when compared to 2018, our performance this quarter and this course, the future earnings power of the company. I would like to start with some highlights, which are strong recovery across most of our markets, mainly demand for increased demand for domestic travel. International tourism is just starting to pick up as many countries begin opening their borders to fully vaccinated tourists. Thus, our international transactions increased 120% sequentially coming from very low levels. As a result, we reported sequential increases of 34% in gross booking, and 44% in transactions. These were driven by first of all, capturing the pick up in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, countries that were impacted in the prior quarter with the second wave of the virus. Second, another strong quarter in Colombia, where we observed significant pent up demand. Mexico was the standout in the prior quarter, but had a weaker performance in July and August, and some of inaudible could not open due to the restrictions that impacted some tourist destinations. On a positive tone, our Mexican operations began to recover in September, and this has continued into October. Our geographic diversification has allowed us to turn to growth across the region as the market recovers. We continue to closely monitor the deliveries of the company, mainly price, market and expenses, and installments. After improvements in our management revenue toolkit, we have been able to report stronger takeaways than pre-pandemic, reaching 12.7% as reported, and 13.7%, excluding extraordinary cancellations. Similar to past quarters, our take rate benefited from the investments we have made in technology and analysis, which allowed us to price more accurately, improving algorithms to capture more process development sections, and the positive impact from that day, which has the highest take rate, were also the contributors. At the same time, on a quarter on quarter basis, revenue growth was more than double the increase in cost of revenues. Lastly, operating expenses increased only 3% sequentially, even as the investments in selling and marketing during the quarter was 36% up sequentially, and in line with increase in gross bookings. Our business leverages, the actions taken last year to improve profitability. This has allowed us to be very close to achieving adjusted EBITDA we were given, when excluding extraordinary charges. Even with gross bookings at 56% on the third quarter of 2018 levels. Importantly, for the month of September, we achieved positive adjusted EBITDA, excluding extraordinary charges. This was an important milestone for us, we will remain well capitalize with a healthy cash position of $276 million. Turning to slide four for discussion on a few of our key markets. As various geographies have reopened post-pandemic, consumers have shifted some trends towards travel and entertainment. Along these lines, Brazil and Colombia posted the highest level of gross bookings since the start of the pandemic. With most states in Brazil listing restrictions in July, gross bookings in the quarter were up 106% sequentially, and ASPs up 33% in the same period. By mid September, several countries listed restrictions, allowing fully vaccinated Brazilians to travel overseas. For the month, as of November the 8th, fully vaccinated Brazilians are now allowed to travel to the US showing proof of full vaccination. In Mexico, although borders remained open for flights, activities in the main cities were particularly restricted to control an increase in COVID cases. These restrictions affected inaudible offline stores performance in July and August. On a positive note, those bookings have been increasing month over month since August, and international travel was stable on a sequential basis. Regarding the rest of LATAM, inaudible Colombia was 32% above the third quarter of 2019, pre-pandemic levels, reflected pent up demand as travel restrictions were lifted earlier in the year. In Argentina, we observed a sequential 150% increase in gross bookings. Finally, in Chile, gross bookings nearly doubled sequentially, and the significant growth trend continues in October. As we entered the fourth quarter, October continued with its positive trend across the regions. Just to summarize, our geographic diversification has been key in providing a more consistent overall performance the company. Turning to slide five, we have two really strong initiatives that we continue to deliver on, and that I will discuss today. First, our loyalty program has been widely accepted and we have reached the one million milestone. Today, the support of Despegar available in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. In this regard, we recently signed an agreement to launch a co-branded credit card in Mexico in partnership with INVEX and MasterCard. Also, capitalizing on the increased travel demand, we launched our first offline marketing campaign since 2020. It's time to travel again, and can be seen across all media in Latin America. In Brazil, we have been offering more financial options to customers. Accordingly, we have further deepened penetration in the Colares, accounting for 6.5% of all transactions in the third week of October, with a record total purchase volume. Additionally, 5.5% of the Colares transactions October were paid through inaudible, which results in much lower cost of revenue for the Colares, given that these transactions are processed internally. We also completed implementation of risk based pricing in the travel vertical, which allows us to match the interest rates charged to the rich profile of these end customers. On Colares B2B business, we continued expanding the number of merchants in the eCommerce sector, which we now provide alternative means for customers to pay the foreign language. They can now pay by their payment solutions. We now have 30 merchants signed up, we also have at least four new merchants in payments and fraud, bringing the total number of merchants to 10, year to date. Notably, current total purchase value for the quarter tripled sequentially. As we look ahead, we expect to be adding more industries to our two verticals in the very near future. We see a very attractive potential for coin services, buy now pay later, and fraud prevention, which have a total addressable market of between 15 and 20 boards in Latin America. I will now turn the call over to Alberto to discuss this quarter's financial results. Thank you Damian, and thank you also for joining us today. Turning to page six, as reported revenues increased 32% sequentially, to 37% below third quarter ' 19 pre-pandemic levels, compared with 39% below second quarter ' 19 levels in the current quarter. Excluding extraordinary considerations in connect- in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues would have been 32% below third quarter ' 19 levels. Note that this quarter, we also saw lower cancellations. The ratio of cancellations to gross bookings decreased 33 basis points quarter on quarter. Importantly, our take rate remains strong, reaching 12.7% as reported, and 13.7% when excluding extraordinary cancellations. These factors and this development were a contribution from building and improvements in revenue management, implemented since last year, which have allowed us to further optimize pricing through more advanced algorithms. Now, please turn to slide seven. Moving on to profitability, we achieved the best quarterly adjusted EBITDA since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in second quarter, 2020. Despite posting gross bookings 44% below third quarter ' 19, we were very close to break even when excluding extraordinary targets. This is proof of the initiatives launched new in the this period, particularly in terms of cost reduction. Excluding extraordinary charges, comparable adjusted EBITDA neared break even, reaching a loss of 3.6 million, improving from losses of 10 and a half million in the third quarter, and nearly 17 million in third quarter 2020. This compares with a comparable adjusted EBITDA gains over $9 million in third quarter ' 19. Note, that one time charges were nearly $7 million in the quarter, mainly in connection with extraordinary cancellations resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, compared to non-regarding charges of 12 million in second quarter t- 2021. We are confident that Despegar will be coming out of the pandemic as a more profitable company, very diversified from both a geographic and product mix perspective, backed by a more sustainable business model. Now, please turn to slide eight. We closed the quarter with a sold cash position of $276 million. As travel conditions improved, use of cash during the quarter increased to nearly 40 million. Recall that in the second quarter, we had granted a higher number of vouchers to customers who's travel plans were impacted by a spike in COVID cases, mainly in Brazil. While this resulted in a lower use of cash of close to 10 million in second quarter ' 21, with better travel conditions in this past quarter, we saw a pick up in demand with customers redeeming travel vouchers. The redemption of these vouchers added 15 million to the cash burn that we have been posting recently, of 25 million. In turn, our net payable position decreased nearly $20 million in the quarter. Now please turn to slide nine for the key takeaways of the quarter. First, we delivered a strong sequential recovery, driven by better performance across our key markets, except for Mexico this quarter. Brazil led the recovery with gross bookings up 126% sequentially, but still 60% below ' 19 levels. Colombia also showed a show inaudible with gross bookings exceeding third quarter ' 19 levels by 32%. Second EBITDA, excluding cancellations, we neared break even, even with gross bookings still 44% below ' 19 levels, as the initiatives implemented since the start of the pandemic have significantly strengthened the earnings power of the company. This positive trend in profitability continued into September with adjusted EBITDA reaching break even levels when excluding extraordinary cancellations. Fourth, we continued to deepen customer engagement with our loyalty program reaching the one million member milestone in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico combined. As demand has picked up, we also launched our first offline marketing campaign since second quarter last year. Finally, on the ESG front, we launched our materiality survey, and look forward to sharing the results in our next ESG report. Now, please turn to slide 10 for final remarks. Despite ongoing volatility and some macro inaudible, our longterm vision is if anything, in sharper focus. The initiatives required to realize it are pulling away even as we work through near term macro challenges and consumer behavior continues to adjust. Looking at the fourth quarter, the strong recovery observed in gross bookings in September continued into October, reaching 72% of ' 19 booking levels. In addition, we expect November and December to continue with these positive trends, benefiting from industry marketing events, such as the Buen Fin campaign in Mexico, and Black Friday in Brazil. December also marks the start of the summer season in LATAM, which would also contribute to higher demand in the region. In this context, we are stepping up our marketing efforts, while keeping a heightened focus on profitability. To illustrate the point, on a weekly basis we are launching a minimum of four unbeatable deals by country, while carefully balancing the price financing perception. With respect to inaudible we are on track with integration of the in destination activities segment, and expect to fully finalize the integration of this acquisition as planned by first quarter next year. We are also making steady headway in expanding coins acquisitions operations, in addition to adding new logos in the B2B business segment in Brazil, we are taking the first steps to launch coin in Mexico early next year. Finally, we are in conversation with several suppliers across the region to expand our vacation rental inventory, to meet current higher demand in this third segment. In summary, our continued focus on enough and our improved performance to date, together with a positive progression in demand, are quite encouraging. We believe that while forecasting future performance did present some challenges due to the ups and downs of the pandemic, we expect that the developments in vaccination front will generate the confidence to go back to normal travel levels. The third quarter and year to date results bring forth our confidence in our strategy and represent focus on discipline in executing our longterm strategic plan. This concludes our prepared remarks, we are ready to answer your questions, operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question you may past star then one on our touch type phone. If you are using a speaker phone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If your question has been addressed and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, please press star then two. Once again, ladies and gentleman, that's star then one if you have a question, and today's first question comes from Ed Uromo with Key Bank, please go ahead. Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question and nice to see the sequential improvements. I guess, a couple of things from me. Um, first, I think you guys have done a really good job of you know, inaudible business during the pandemic and making yourselves more efficient. Is there a way that we should think, as bookings rebuild from an incremental margin perspective and how the shape may differ than what we've seen previously? And second, um, kind of as expected, you- you're gonna draw down on the cash a bit I guess, as people redeem vouchers. How should we think about the cash usage progression over the next couple of quarters, and when will that trough? Thank you. Ed, Alberto, good morning. Thanks for your question. On cash, I think, allow me to reiterate what we discussed in prior calls, uh, I r- actually, re- recall your question. Okay, we are looking at the similar levels to what we have discussed, let's say like, a minimum cash value for the year of around 250, okay? In particular driven for the same reasons that you highlighted. With regards to margins, clearly we are in the trajectory that we're actually break even point. We already, in the month of October, that we are closing those figures, okay, we're seeing, um, um, already, um, blue lines when it comes to at an EBITDA level, that is particularly encouraging. When you start looking at margins, let's say top to bottom, okay, we, we are seeing, um, take rate at similar levels to, to the ones we have been discussing. Okay, let's recall what we have mentioned in prior calls about having, let's say, a- a longterm trajectory on ticket at around, uh, uh 12%. Okay, 12% plus, that is higher in around 50 basis points we will discuss, uh, pre-pandemic. With regards to, um, uh, structural cost, uh, while we are, what we have said is that the structural cost, uh, should actually benefit from, let's say, a- uh, around 60%, uh, operating leverage. Meaning that if orders were to grow around 100, okay, structural cost should be growing no more than, than 40%. Uh, and that, uh, I would say points to a picture, uh, on what could be the profitability of the company going forward. That is, should be in excess of what we were discussing pre-pandemic in the long run. Got it, and maybe one other followup. Um, you indicated you're looking to kind of, rebuild inventory for packages, given some of the demand signals you're seeing. Um, I guess how quickly can that happen and do you expect that you'll be able to, um, to have enough kind of capacity for the peak travel seasons? Thank you. We currently see, um, I think that, that answer has maybe t- two, two, two different ideas. Number one is, uh, the company, uh, um, continues to be, let's say, on the sidelines when it comes to, uh, let's say, secured inventory, uh, as we have done pre-pan- pandemic, okay? Remember that, uh, we were actually at around, let's say, 5%, uh, on n- n- n- no, uh, between 5-10 %, no more than that, uh, of all the gross bookings we're selling, were actually secured, occupying advance on capacity at hotels, uh, and\/or airlines, okay? Uh, since the pandemic struck, we, we were completely on the sidelines of that, and we are now thinking about starting to push into that arena, um, uh, as of, let's say, the, the next few quarters, and we do not see a reason to do it given, uh, number one, uh, uh the ups and downs of the business, and number two, the, we, we see capacity so there's no need to do it. Okay? Of course, we see that as a profitable business and that will be, uh, will put the, the, um, um, our, our foot on, on, on, on the gas pedal, uh, as the, uh, we are fully recovered, because we see there's, there are, there's opportunity to gain extra margin. But for, for the time being, we will not do it. In uh, region in, and in regional inventory, what we are seeing is that, uh, airlines are, uh, increasing their network significantly, Latin America for the upcoming two to three months. So everything that's, uh, available from the airlines and the inaudible is gonna be in Despegar, and we are seeing in- increases levels of, uh, of inventory on both areas. So we are confident that the pace of this recovery will be sustainable the next few months. Very good, thanks so much. And ladies and gentleman, as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from Kevin Coupleman, with Talent and Company. Please go ahead. Uh, good morning. This is Emily on for Kevin, thanks for taking my question. Um, you mentioned a new marketing campaign, uh, launching in Q4 focused on affordability, and I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that will affect, um, revenue take rate, installments and sales and marketing expenses in the quarter? Thanks. Hi Emily, thanks for your question. This is Damian. Um, uh, t- the new campaign was, uh, extremely, this has been extremely successful, inaudible, and uh, what we are pointing towards is, uh, getting back to travel and being able to afford the travel, uh, as, as always have been positioned in the market section. We do not expect that this will represent or be reflected in any lower take rate. Remember that as we mentioned during the observed remarks, uh, we have a higher significant r- revenue margin capabilities. So we are being much more effective than in the past in increasing, uh, demand without having to give up, uh, significantly on the take rate. So the numbers that Alberto referred to in this question should be, uh, sustained over the next few months. Very clear, thank you. Thank you, and ladies and gentleman, this concludes our question and answer session, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management team for any final remarks. Thank you very much. Um, just wanted to thank all of you, uh, for your participation and interest in this regard. We hope you all, uh, remain healthy and safe, and thanks for joining us today, looking forward to seeing you on our next call, bye. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation, you may not disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
      "withCtc" : "Good morning and welcome to the Desperate Third Quarter 21 Earnings Conference Call. A slide presentation is accompanying today's webcast and is available in the investor section of the company's website, investor.despigar.com. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of today's presentation. This conference call is being recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in listen only mode. Now I would like to turn the call over to Miss Natalia Mirenberg, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning everyone and thanks for showing us today for the discussion of our third quarter twenty twenty one results. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles, we discussed certain non-gap financial measures from operating metrics, including foreign exchange user calculations. Investors should read the definition of these measures and metrics, including in our relatives carefully, to ensure that they understand them. Non-GAP financial measures and operating metrics should not be considered in isolation as substitute for or superior two gas financial measures and are provided as supplementary information only. Before we begin, our preferred remarks, allow me to remind you that certain statements made during the course of the discussion may constitute forward looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ, including factors that may be beyond the company's control. These include, but are not limited to, expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID nineteen pandemic and the integration and performance of the businesses we acquire, including the SA and COM. For the description of the team, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our press release. Speaking on today's call is our CEO, Damian Scockin, who will provide an overview of the third quarter and update you on our strategic priorities. Alberto Lopez Afini, our CSO, will then discuss the quarter's financial results. After that, we'll all we open the call to your questions. Danielle, please go ahead. Thank you, Natalia, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the spirit. Our third quarter results demonstrate that the strategic initiatives undertaken since the start of the pandemic and their successful execution are delivering improved margins when compared to twenty nineteen. Our performance this quarter underscores the future earnings power of the company. I'd like to touch on some highlights. We show strong recovery across most of our markets, mainly driven by increased demand for domestic travel. International tourism is just starting to pick up as many countries begin opening their borders to fully vaccinated tourists. Thus, our international transactions increased one hundred and twenty percent sequentially, coming from very low levels. As a result, we reported sequential increases of thirty four percent in gross booking and forty four percent in transactions. This was driven by, first of all, capturing the pickup in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, countries that were impacted in the prior quarter with the second wave of the virus. Second, another strong quarter in Colombia, where we observed significant tent up demand. Mexico was standout in the prior quarter, but had a weaker performance in July and August, and some of best day stores could not open due to the restrictions that impacted some key touristic destinations. On a positive tone, our Mexican operations began to recover in September. This has continued into October. Our geographic diversification has allowed us to capture growth across the region as market recovers. We continue to closely monitor the key levers of the company, namely price, marketing expenses and instalments. After improvements in our management revenue toolkit, we have been able to report stronger take rates than pre pandemic, reaching twelve point seven percent as reported, and thirteen point seven percent, excluding extraordinary cancellations. Similar to past quarters, our take rate benefited from the investments we have made in technology and analytics, which allowed us to price more accurately, improving algorithms to capture more profitable transactions and the positive impact from Best Day, which has a higher take rate, were also key contributors. At the same time, on a quarter on quarter basis, revenue growth was more than double the increase in cost of revenues. Lastly, operating expenses increased only three percent sequentially, even as business leverages the actions taken last year to improve profitability. This has allowed us to be very close to achieving adjusted evidently given when excluding extraordinary charges, even with gross bookings at only fifty six percent of the third quarter of twenty eighteen level. Importantly, for the month of September, we achieve positive adjusted EBITDA, excluding extraordinary charges. This was an important milestone for us. We remain well capitalised with a healthy tax position of two hundred seventy six million dollars, turning to slide four for a discussion on a few of our key markets. As various geographies have reopened post pandemic, consumers have shifted some spend towards travel and entertainment. Along these lines, Brazil and Colombia posted the highest level of cross booking since the start of the pandemic. With most states in Brazil listing restrictions in July, ROS bookings in the quarter were up one hundred and twenty six percent sequentially, and ASPs up thirty three percent in the same period. By mid September, several countries lifted restrictions allowing fully vaccinated Brazilians to travel overseas. Furthermore, as of november eighth november, fully vaccinated Brazilians are now allowed to travel to the US show improve of full vaccination. In Mexico, although borders remained open for flights, activities in main cities were particularly restricted to control and increase in COVID cases. These restrictions affected best day offline source performance in July and August. On a positive note, ROS bookings have been increasing month over months since August and international travel was stable on a sequential basis. Regarding the rest of LATAM, noteworthy Colombia was thirty two percent above the third quarter of twenty nineteen, pre pandemic levels, reflected pent up demand as travel restrictions were listed earlier in the year. In Argentina, we observed a sequential one hundred and fifty percent increase in gross bookings. Finally, in Chile, gross bookings nearly doubled sequentially, and this significant growth trend continued in October. As we entered the fourth quarter, October continued with this positive trend across the region. Just to summarize, our geographic diversification has been key in providing a more consistent overall performance for the company. Turning to slide five, we have two really strong initiatives that we continue to deliver on and that I will discuss today. First, our loyalty programme has been widely accepted and we have reached the one million member milestone. Today, as a porte especiality available in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. In this regard, we recently signed an agreement to launch a co branded credit card in Mexico in partnership with Index and MasterCard, also capitalising on increased travel demand, we launched our first offline marketing campaign since twenty twenty. It's time to travel again and can be seen across all media in Latin America. In Brazil, we have been offered more financing options to customers. With coin, we have further deepened penetration in the collar, accounting for six point five percent of all transactions in the third week of October, with a record total purchase volume. Additionally, five or five percent of the collar transactions in October were paid through PICs, which results in much lower cost of revenue for the collar given that these transactions are processed internally. We also completed implementation of risk-based pricing in the travel vertical, which allows us to match the interest rate chart to the risk profile of different customers. On Coins B2B business, we continue expanding the number of merchants in the e-commerce sector, to which we now provide the alternative means for customers to pay via boleto parasilila and by now pay later payment solutions. We now have thirty merchants signed up. We also added four new merchants in payments and fraud, bringing the total number of merchants to ten year today, notably, coin's total purchase value for the quarter tripled sequentially. As we look ahead, we expect to be adding more industries to our two verticals in the very near future. We see a very attractive potential for coin services, by now pay later and fraud prevention, which have a total addressable market of between fifteen and twenty billion dollars in Latin America. I will now turn the call over to Alberto to discuss this quarter's financial results. Thank you, Damian, and thank you all for joining us today. Turning to page six, A reSported revenues increased thirty two percent sequentially to thirty seven percent below third quarter nineteen pre pandemic levels, compared with thirty nine percent below second quarter nineteen levels in the prior quarter. Excluding extraordinary cancellations in connect in connection with the COVID nineteen pandemic, revenues would have been thirty two percent below third quarter 19 levels. Note that this quarter we also saw lower cancellations. The ratio of cancellations to gross bookings decreased 33 basis points quarter on quarter. Importantly, our take rate remains strong, reaching 12.7% as reported, and 13.7% when excluding extraordinary cancellations. Key factors in this development were the contribution from Bell Day and improvements in revenue management implemented since last year, which have allowed us to further optimize pricing through more advanced algorithms. Now please turn to slide seven. Moving on to profitability, we achieved the best quarterly adjusted EVIDA since the start of the COVID nineteen pandemic in seventh quarter twenty twenty. Despite posting growth bookings forty four percent below third quarter nineteen, we were very close to break even when excluding extraordinary charges. This is proof of the initiatives launched during this period, particularly in terms of cost reduction. Excluding extraordinary charges, comparable adjusted DB data near breakeven, reaching a loss of three point six million, improving from losses of ten and a half million in the final quarter, and nearly seventeen million in third quarter twenty twenty. This compares with a comparable adjusted dividend gain of over nine million dollars in third quarter nineteen. Note that one-time charges were nearly seven million dollars in the quarter, mainly in connection with extraordinary cancellations resulting from the surge in COVID-19 cases, compared to non-reentcurr charges of twelve million in second quarter twenty twenty one. We are confident that the Spegar will be coming out of the pandemic as a more profitable company, better diversified both from a geographic and product mixed perspective, backed by a more sustainable business model. Now please turn to slide eight. We closed the quarter with a solid cash position of two hundred and seventy six million dollars. As travel conditions improved, use of cash during the quarter increased to nearly 40 million. Recall that in the second quarter we had granted a higher number of vouchers to customers whose travel plans were impacted by a spike in COVID cases, mainly in Brazil. While this resulted in a lower use of cash of close to ten million in second quarter twenty one, with better travel conditions in this past quarter, we saw a pickup in demand with customers redeeming travel vouchers. The redemption of these vouchers added 15 million to the cash burn that we have been posted recently of 25 million. In turn, our net payable position decreased nearly twenty million dollars in the quarter. Now please turn to slide nine for the key takeaways of the quarter. First, we delivered a strong sequential recovery, driven by better performance across our key markets, except for Mexico Disnoted. Brazil led the recovery with gross bookings up one hundred and twenty six percent sequentially, but still sixty percent below nineteen levels. Colombia also showed a strong pend up with gross bookings exceeding third quarter nineteen levels by thirty two percent. Second, EBITDA excluding cancellations here break even, even with gross booking still forty four percent below nineteen levels. As the initiatives implemented since the start of the pandemic have significantly strengthened the earnings power of the company. This positive trend in profitability continued into September, with adjusted DP DAI reaching break even levels when excluding extraordinary cancellations. Fourth, we continue to deepen customer engagement with our loyalty program, reaching the one million member milestone in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico combined. As the money has picked up, we also launched our first offline marketing campaign since the second quarter last year. Finally, on the ESG front, we launched our materiality survey last month and look forward to sharing the results in our next ESG report. Now, please turn to slide ten for final remarks. Despite ongoing volatility and some macro murkiness, our long term vision is, if anything, a sharper focus. The initiatives required to realize it are fully underway even as we work through near-term macro challenges and consumer behavior continues to adjust. Looking at the fourth quarter, the strong recovery observed in gross bookings in September continued into October, reaching 72% of 19 booking levels. In addition, we expect November and December to continue with these positive trends, benefiting from industry marketing events such as the Buenfillment Campaign in Mexico and Black Friday in Brazil. December also marks the start of the summer season in LATAM, which would also contribute to higher demand in the region. In this context, we are stepping up our marketing efforts while keeping a heightened focus on affordability. To illustrate the point, on a weekly basis we are launching a minimum of four unbeatable deals by country while carefully balancing the price financing perception. With respect to Belday, we are on track with integration of the in-destination activity segment and expect to fully finalise the integration of this acquisition as planned by 1st autumn next year. We are also making steady headway in expanding coins acquisitions operations. In addition to adding new logos in the B2B business segment in Brazil, we're taking the first steps to launch coin in Mexico early next year. Finally, we are in conversation with several suppliers across the region to expand our vacation rental inventory to meet current higher demand in this product segment. In summary, our continued focus on execution and our improved performance to date, together with the positive progression in demand, are quite encouraging. We believe that while forecasting future performance still presents some challenges due to the ups and downs of the pandemic. We expect that the developments in vaccination front will generate the confidence to go back to normal travel patterns. The third quarter and year-to-date results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and represent focus and discipline in executing our long-term strategic plan. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are ready to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star than one on your touchstone phone. If you are using a speaker phone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If your question has been addressed and you'd like to remove yourself from queue, please press star than two. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that's star than one if you have a question. And today's first question comes from Ed Yeruma with KeyBank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and nice to see the sequential improvement. I guess a couple of things for me. Um first, I think you guys have done a really good job of, you know, right size in the business during the pandemic and making yourselves more efficient. Is there a way that we should think as bookings rebuild from an incremental margin perspective and how the shape may differ than what we've seen previously? And second, um, kind of as expected, you you're gonna draw down on the cash a bit, I guess, as people redeem vouchers. How should we think about the cash usage progression over the next couple quarters and when will that trough? Thank you. to reiterate what we discussed in prior calls. I re actually re I recall your question. Okay, we are looking at the similar levels to what we have discussed, let's say like a minimum cash value for the year of around two hundred and fifty. Okay. In particular driven for the same reasons that you that you highlighted. Okay. We are uh in the trajectory that we are actually reaching break even point. Okay, we we already uh in the month of October that we are closing those figures, okay, we're seeing um uh already uh blue lines when it comes to at an EBDA level that is particularly encouraging. When you start looking at margins, let's say top to bottom, okay, we we are seeing um take rate at similar levels to to the ones we we we have been discussing. Okay, let's recall what we have mentioned in prior calls about having let's say a a long term trajectory on on take it at around uh uh twelve percent. With regards to structural cost, what we have said is that the structural cost uh should actually benefit from let's say uh uh around sixty percent uh operating leverage, meaning that if orders were to grow around a hundred, okay, structural cost shoulds be growing no more than than forty percent. And that uh I would say points to a picture uh on what could be the profitability of the company going forward, that is should be in excess of what we were discussing pre pandemic in the long run. Got it. And maybe one other follow up. Um you indicated you're looking to kind of rebuild inventory for packages given some of the demand signals you're seeing. Um I guess how quickly can that happen and do you expect that you'll be able to um to have enough kind of capacity for the peak travel seasons. Thank you. We currently see um I I think that w that answer has maybe two two two different ideas. Number one is uh the company uh um continues to be let's say on the sidelines when it comes to uh let's say securing inventory uh as we have done pre pan pre pandemic. Okay, remember that uh we were actually at around let's say five percent uh or n no uh between five to ten percent no, more than that. Uh of all the gross bookings were selling were actually uh secured or ke paid in advance on capacity at hotels uh and or airlines. Okay. Since the pandemic struck we we were completely on the sidelines of that and we are not thinking about starting to push into that arena um uh as of let's say the the next few quarters. And we do not see a reason to do it given number one uh the ups and downs of the business and number two the we see we see capacity so there's no need to do it. Okay? Of course we see that as a profitable business and that will be uh we put'll the the um um our our foot on the on on on the gas pedal uh as the we are fully recovered because we see there's there are there's opportunity to gain extra margins. But for for the time being we will not do it. In addition, Ed and in in general inventory, what we are seeing is that uh airlines are uh increasing their network significantly in Latin America for the upcoming two to three months. So everything that's uh available from the airlines and the hotel is gonna be in the spegar and we are seeing increased levels of uh of inventory on both areas. So we are confident that the pace of the recovery will be sustained over the next few months. Very good. Thanks much. And ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press start and one. Our next question comes from Kevin Koppelman with Cowan and Company. Please go ahead. Uh good morning. This is Emily on for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. Um you mentioned a new marketing campaign uh launching in Q four focused on affordability. And I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that will affect um revenue take rate installments and sales and marketing expenses in the quarter. Thanks. Hi Emily, thanks for your question. This is Damian. Um the the new campaign was uh extremely effective, it's been extremely effective though it's still running. And uh what we are pointing towards is uh getting back to travel and being able to afford the travel uh as as we always have been positioned in the minds of consumers. We do not expect that this will represent or be reflected in any lower take rates. Remember that as we mentioned during the remarks, uh we have enhanced significantly our revenue management capabilities. So we are being much more effective than in the past in increasing uh demand without having to give up uh significantly on the tech rate. So the the numbers that Alberto referred to in the previous question should be uh sustained over the next few months. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer. session I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for the final remarks. Thank you very much. And just wanted to thank all of you uh for your participation and interest in this cigar. We hope you all uh remain healthy and safe and thanks for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing you on our next call. Bye. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may not disconnect your minds and have a wonderful day."

Afterwards, at the Relo Miney, we'll provide an overview of the key elements of our ESD strategy and goals. Maria Noviglia, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Anna. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide four of our earning presentation. While we saw our prebound in economic activity to pre pandemic levels this quarter, we continue to operate under challenging market conditions, with high inflation, negative real interest rates and industry loans at historical lows and growing below inflation. In addition, Central Bank regulations continue to wait on NIM. We delivered sequentially improved results, reporting an attributable loss of sixty million pesos in third two twenty one compared to a three hundred forty eight million pesos in the prior quarter. It was mainly driven by lower load of provisions reflecting our strong underwriting and collection policies, along with a pickup in economic activ.ities Lower breaking expenses also contributed to the performance, but we continue to resign our branch network, accelerate telephone efficiency and executing our digital and channel transformation strategy. Our comparable efficiency ratio, excluding non recurrent severance payments and early retirement charges, improved to seventy one percent this quarter from seventy two percent in the second quarter, also significantly impacted by a low revenue base. Looking at the first nine months of the year and excluding non recurring charges, expenses were down nearly seven percent year on year. We also maintained a solid capital base with year one ratio of fourteen point one percent at quarter end and a strong liquidity to navigate the current environment and implement our strategic transformation. Patricio will provide shortly an update of our progress on our digital and channel transformation agenda, followed by Atio who will present our key ESG milestones and goals. Now please turn to slide five. We expanded our learning book by five percent sequentially, growing above industry levels and recovering market share. Loan growth was mainly driven by higher mandatory credit lines to S and E, which rose to a financial of nearly twenty billion pesos, accounting for over thirty percent of total loans this quarter from a balance of fourteen million pesos in the prior quarter. Short term financing to corporate also contributed to loan growth, along with strong origination in personal loans, which reached the record high in October. US total loans in original currency in turn declined ten percent sequentially. Now moving to funding on class six. The loan to deposit ratio remains relatively stable border on border at fifty-three percent with liquidity at solid levels. Back to deposites increasing the high single digits sequentially, driven mainly by institutional funding from liquidity management and corporate checking accounts. Core deposits were stable quarter on quarter. Dollar deposits in original currency were at 1.5% sequentially, accounting for slide B over eleven percent of total deposits. Turning to slide seven, MIM contracted two percentage points to seventeen from nineteen percent in the second quarter. While GDP growth returns to pre pandemic level allowing us to capture standard growth, over rated man remains weak. This, together with a lower yield and inflation linked mortgages zones, given the disaceleration in the price index, and regulatory controls continues to exert pressure on it. Turning to also quality on file eight. Our strong enterprising and collection policies, together with improved economic conditions, allowed us to release a portion of the COVID nineteen specific provisions created last year. As a result, download provisions declined to one point four billion from two billion in the prior quarter. In turn, cost of risk net improved to three point five percent from five point seven percent in the second quarter. At quarter end, COVID nineteen anticipatory provisions amounted to one point six billion pesos versus two point four billion as of june thirty. Our total provisioning ratio is two that six point six percent in September, above the pre pandemic level of six point four percent post in january twenty twenty. The total NPR ratio for the border increased twenty major point sequentially to five point five percent, but declined after peaking to five point five percent in July. The sequential increase was mainly driven by the consumer finance segments. As anticipated, we saw an increase in delinquency and instalments were due after the expiration of the grace period with, the consumer finance and feel ratio reaching a peak of nearly twenty one percent as quarrellan. To consign delinquency we have timed operate policies as you do so that new originators don't have a better rating. To a lesser extent, NPL also increased to five point one percent from two point two percent at the bank's personal loan segment after the expiration of the grade period and the mandatory reclassification of customers performing with SuperB but non-performing with other banks. By contrast, corporate SMEs and bank credit cards offered a sequential improvement in MPS ratio. Slide nine. Although guidance remains suspended due to sustained and immediate visibility on slide nine, we share our views on the main drivers of our business for the remainder of the year and twenty twenty two. Starting with speculative eliminated loans, we expect to see growth in line or below inflation in twenty twenty one, both commercial and consumer loans, and above inflation in twenty twenty two. We also expect to end the year with deposits growing above inflation, fostered by affects restrictions and to a lower extent by interest rate scores and time deposits. We expect deposits to continue growing above inflation, driven by the same trends. With respect to assess quality as anticipated, NPLs leave this order and are expected to remain instable or decline in following quarters. We also expect coverage to decline as COVID nineteen provisions are used for rebirth. Cost of risk in turn is expected to be below twenty twenty and twenty nineteen levels, but in line with historical levels of five to six percent. In terms of margins, for the remainder of the year and twenty twenty two, we expect means to remain pressured by higher cost of funds resulting from the impact of the plural interest rates on time deposits and subsidized rates on loans. This would be partially offset by higher inflation together with credit demand anticipated to gradually pick up from historical loans. Personal and administrative expenses are likely to grow with inflation, while also reflecting additional restructuring costs and expenses as well as healthcare deficiencies from the execution of our digital and channel recycling. Higher turnover taxes and the extension of the turnover tax reach to the leaks and reports in the city of West Ide will continue to negatively impact expenses. At the same time, the INCAP is expected to grow in line with inflation. Finally, we continue to expect capital and liquidity to remain at profitable levels, supporting long term sustainability. As noted earlier, one hundred percent of our capital is hedged against inflation. Now let me call turn the call to Francis Bartiel, who will provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Patricio, please go ahead. Thank you Mariano. You heard Mariano present our financial results and views for the remainder of the year in twenty twenty two. In this challenging context, we remain fully focused on advancing on our transformation strategy. Starting with the transformation of our branch channels, using best in class technologies to facilitate self-service banking and expand SME reach with a vision of everywhere and anytime banking. First, digitised customers have increased consistently over the past two years and were up 76% since March last year. Second, keeping a strong focus on the customer experience, we recently deployed an upgraded version of the bank's mobile app, rated four point four in the PlayStation and four point three in the after store. Third, with the successful performance of a virtual hub MPTs for individuals in the province of Pan San Luis, we are starting to scale this hybrid model to other regions and segments and expanding our footprint while offering a superior customer experience, combining the strength of our face-to-face approach with the high efficiency of our virtual hub. This also allows us to expand our footprints through our national territory without needing practice. And fourth, in the in the past four months we modernised and expanded services to SMEs and related segments in eleven branches that were previously solely dedicated to senior citizens, and expect we expect to convert four additional branches to multi segment format before year end. Now please turn to slide eleven. At the same time, we have been introducing technological innovation at our senior citizen branches, facilitating self service banking for this customer segment, which was the least advanced in terms of digital adoption. Let me share some examples of the success of these initiatives. To allow for extended banking hours and higher efficiencies, we enlarged our twenty four hour lobbies increasing the number of biometric cash dispensers located in these lobbies. As of September cash December dis dispensers in twenty four lobbies, thirty four hour lobby accounted for fifty-three percent of total country spends that up for around twenty four percent before the pandemic and nearly four forty percent a year ago. As a result, the number of transactions at human channels declined sharply to two percent of total transactions from eleven percent a year ago and twenty two percent before the pandemic. We are also seeing continued adoption of our digital digital app dedicated ninety days locked in customers through the app, increasing over a hundred and forty four percent when compared This turn to slide twelve. As you can see, we are also advancing on the right size of our branch network. The introduction of best in class technologies to extend service hours, facilitating self service banking in some branches, while converting others to full service format is allowing us to enhance customer service and productivity. As a result, we closed one branch in the second quarter and plan to close another sixteen between the remainder of twenty twenty one and next year, subject to central bank authorization. These initiatives have allowed us to lower headcount by nearly six percent year on year. Thisase now turn to slide thirteen. Our IT infrastructure strategy includes creating an API environment to accelerate service development and time to market to transform our customer journey. So in the first nine months of the year we added a total of ninety five ACIs and plan to add another one hundred and fifty three by the end of twenty twenty two. We are also advancing on the implementation of Adal the Data Lake to become a data driven enterprise while migrating technology to a hybrid multi cloud to provide the flexibility to grow efficiently. By October twenty, uh by October, twenty percent of our technology would already already migrated to the cloud and we expect to reach thirty percent by year end, with seven seventy percent of our technology anticipated to be migrated to the cloud by the the end of year twenty twenty four. Please now turn to page fourteen. We are also making progress on deploying our growth strategy for UDO and UDO servicios. Next week we are formally launching Udo Mobile Retail Digital Saving Account that will enable us to grow our current days and attract low casting, low cost funding at this subsidiary. After a successful soft launch in last August, UDO has already opened two hundred and thirty thousand accounts among current customers. Udoo clients also have access to a wide range of digital banking services, insurance and wellness offerings, and we will continue adding new features and services in the coming months. We also have made progress in our goal of diversifying revenue origination beyond Argentina by deploying well being and health services under the B two C or B to B to C format in certain countries in LATAM, excluding Brazil. We are in this time advancing with Grupo Assistir and Europe assistance to implement in second quarter twenty twenty two B2C Wbeelling and health Services in Paraguay. The offering will consist of health, dentistry, pharmacy, medical emergency, and veterinary veterinary services. Services will be marketed through the U Do Wellness Marketplace, which will host a variety variety of well wellness services under one platform, offering customers a simple and convenient and seamless experience. Additional information on the progress of our digital TPIs and a more detailed description of all these initiatives and timelines can be found at the back of our earnings call presentation. In summary, we will we while we saw improved activity in the quarter, near term profitability is expected to remain impacted by overall weak credit demand, pressure on NIMS, together with the constant investments required to continue building our ecosystem and execute our transformation strategy. This strategy positions us to retain and enhance our customer relationship uh our current customer relationships while attracting new digital clients and driving operational efficiency in the longer term when Now before opening the call to QA, let me turn the call to Attila De Doro, one of our board members, and responsible for for leading our EC ESG strategy, who will provide an update on of our initiatives and ambitions on this front. Patrio, please go ahead. Thank you. Patricio. As Grupo Superior we understand the need for a more long term and more sustainable view of shareholder value creation. Until not long ago, a more philanthropic vision prevailed in our corporate social responsibility model. As of twenty nineteen, CSR is integrated into the group's core business through a responsible management model oriented towards sustainability. CSR is no longer a goal contribution per year to NGOs. It is a way of doing business. We believe that how, not just what, matters in the business value creation process. In this new phase, we have assumed a commitment to grow sustainably, protecting the environment and pursuing our business strategy in a socially responsible manner. We believe that enhanced disclosure of non financial information such as environmental, social and governance-related factors satisfies the growing demand for an alignment of corporate financial performance with the company's performance in non-financial factors. To develop our EST strategy, we have defined our pillars and commitments shown on slide 15. In slide 16, we present our ESG recent and most relevant highlights. In terms of our environmental responsibility, we work to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment by implementing a responsible environmental management system. We have been measuring our carbon footprint since twenty nineteen and we compensate our greenhouse emissions to protect forest ecosystems. Renewable energy represents fourteen four percent of total energy consumption in our buildings. In addition, we have implemented a plastic waste management programme to eliminate single use plastics, and we have reduced paper consumption by forty six com per cent compared with twenty nineteen. Note that seventy-five percent of the paper consumed maternity is responsibly source paper to protect forest ecosystems. In connection with social responsibility, we focus on financial education, which is the tier set of financial inclusion. More than eighty eight thousand senior citizens' clients attended digital literacy and financial education programmes conducted in alliance with twenty one universities in seven provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. 95% of transactions are conducted through our digital and automated channels. Diversity is also a key aspect of our social responsibility. In twenty twenty-one, we launched a comprehensive program to promote a diverse and inclusive work culture. We also work on more than twenty-six corporate philanthropy programs with focus on education, childhood, senior people, and civic strengthening initiatives. With respect to our responsibility with good governance, we believe a robust corporate finance is uh is key for guaranteeing a sustainable business model over a long term. As Sun Yang recently conducted a risk regulatory assessment and verified ninety-seven percent compliance with the inventory of obligations applicable to Groupus Perviene. The area of compliance monitors the correction prevention program and our whistle blowing hotline allows employees, suppliers and clients to report any malpractice unlawful or unethical behaviour. We have defined quantifiable metrics for our sustainability initiatives. On slide seventeen you will see the key and not relevant ESC goals for twenty twenty four. In relation to our environmental responsibility, we have set the following goals. We will continue to measure our carbon footprint, set in a goal of six percent reduction and fifty percent carbon compensation to protect millinary forests. And on the other hand, a target of forty five percent of our total portfolio screened and analysed through our environmental and social risk policy. With respect to our social responsibility, we have set the following goals. Thirty-three percent of women in senior executive possessions by twenty twenty four, and one hundred and twenty thousand people attending our financial education programmes. Finally, our responsibility with good governance goals include publishing fully integrated sustainability reports by twenty twenty three, prepared according to the global reporting initiative and in addition we aim to have ten hundred percent of our strategic suppliers submitting a self evaluation form assessing compliance with our policies related to human rights, diversity and governance practice. Thank you, Adelio. At this time we will be conducting the question and answer session. questions by voice, please press the raise your hand button and press it again to withdraw your question. You can also send your questions in written form via the QA box. We would ask you to limit yourself to one question and follow up after after we're going what we follow for questions. The first question comes from Ernesto uh Gami Gamilondo at Bank of America. Please go ahead Ernesto thank you Anna. Uh good morning, uh Patricio, Mariano, Batilio, uh good morning everyone. Uh thank you for your presentation uh and for the opportunity. Uh m my first question is on uh the political outlook in Argentina. Um after the midterm elections uh I would like to know uh which do you think are the key challenges ahead uh and if you think there are like potential key dates uh that we should be following. So that that's my first question. Um well f first of all um there was a clear uh there was a a clear win of of uh the opposition and um what uh I believe that uh uh I mean the President has announced uh that in in December uh this December they will present a multi year uh economic programme um in order to um to have the the approval of Congress. And uh what uh we uh expect um I mean we we we know that uh there is uh a deadline with the IMF so the there is uh a short time frame uh for the government to negotiate this multi year plan in order to to to make it uh to to have more sustainable fiscal policies effects more more realistic uh also effects um um uh levels in order to uh enhance uh export oriented industries and to strengthen the the f the the the the reserves of the central bank. Um uh I uh what is uh not uh yet really clear is uh whether um um there is a a clear line uh in in the government in order to to to to to make uh this uh let's say a commitment for this uh uh economic plan we will see this is a very it's gonna be an inter interesting period. Uh but uh um I think also the attitude what is important is the attitude of the of the IMF, whether they they will uh let's say uh allow for um uh sort of a a mu um mudle through um uh economic policy until twenty twenty three or they will be strict in the sense that they want to have um a lessening of of expenditures, public expenditures and and reduction of subsidies and so on. So so this is I think the the what we are looking for. I don't know if uh you want to add something Alejandro on that? I think you you've hit on most of the points, uh Patricia. As you said, it's key to understand what the scope and the depth of the agreement with the IMF will be and uh going back to Ernesto's question as to dates, I think that you should follow carefully these talks to be able to establish when an agreement is reached. you so much. Then I just a second question on the FinTech uh competitive landscape. Uh I would appreciate if you can share with us uh who you see as the main players. Uh the one I have on top of my mind is UALA. Uh and how do you think Yugo and your new digital initiatives are against the other syntaxes? Okay. Um uh I I think that um uh that I mean Walla basically is is focusing on on on on providing solutions for people who don't have uh bank accounts and uh and uh they they are giving uh a value proposition on that. Uh and um but uh the the mi the main the main problem is that uh they don't have deposits. Uh no this is the reason why now they they are applying for a banking license. In order to to to reach scale in Argentina uh you need to have uh a a license to to get deposits and uh uh you can see this for instance uh if you look at uh the size of uh uh the funds that were collected by the the uh by by Bancado Pago in uh the in relation to the the the fund industry is is um is nearly irrelevant and they've been working on and this uh so this is an e this is an extreme example that uh um the let's say only uh working uh with uh transactionality um as a fintech player in Argentina is not is is is not um uh they don't they're not able to to to reach um um they they need to to have let's say the this a bank a bank license in order to to become a player in Argentina because of the restrictions we have in Argentina. In the case of Udoo, uh Udoo is uh is is transforming itself from a consumer finance operation uh fully almost fully focused in uh in providing uh financial services, credit cards and personal loans to uh people, customers who um uh who come to Tango to the Walmart uh Tango Mass um supermarket stores uh to what's now uh to a full digital service and uh we for for me our main goal now now will be to attract deposits, retail deposits, and this will have a significant impact for us, uh to um I I believe to to lower our cost of funds and to have a more sus much more sustainable business and I hope and I think it will impact a lot in in in the overall uh net net income revenue of uh uh on capital creation of Grupo Superviel. I don't know if you want to add something on the scene text, uh Alejandro. I think I think you mentioned the key issue of funding and access to funding. Uh I also think that you do have done a terrific job at uh enhancing customer experience and putting together a very superior product offering. And I think those two things combined with the strength of of the funding capability will will make a very strong um positioning in the market in the next quarters. Thank you Patricio and Alessandro. Very helpful. Thank you, Ernesto. Our next question comes from Gabriel Nobrega at City. Hello, good morning, Gabriel. Please go ahead. Sorry about that. Um I was having some technical difficulties. So uh thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Um my first question is actually on loan demand. Um if you could elaborate further uh what's driving um this higher demand uh which we're seeing um I know that you say in in your press release that um it's undue um to the government programs um um focused on um SMEs. Um but I just wanted to understand um if you think that um we are at an inflection point uh where loan demand isn't going to um start increasing and um how um are you going to be able to control your adverse uh selection in this uh scenario? And ask a second question afterwards. Thank you. Okay. Gabriel uh it's real that we are in a very low point of low of uh of low demand, credit lone demand, and uh we believe that it has uh mainly to do with the lack of of business business confidence and and uh also consumer confidence. Um so um um we need these signals to to reignite the the the the known demand. Having having said that, there are certain um uh particular enterprises that are uh export oriented and uh and uh they they continue to perform well in the economy and uh they they they are asked I mean they we we continue to to serve them uh with uh with different kinds of credits, uh particularly pre export financing. Um uh also um there there are enterprises that uh take advantage of stock child loans to to to to take uh leasing lines where we are very strong in leasing in order to replace equipment. Um but um um and for individuals uh it's I think it's the same problem. Uh very very very lack a lot I mean lack of uh of uh of appetite for for long demand. Um what we see uh um eventually is uh an an uh an an interest in in car financing because people see Arg in Argentina today cars to be a protection of value. So used card financing is uh is driving um um some um uh a n certain number of loans uh in in in uh at b at bank at the bank level and also at you. I I don't know if you want to add on on that, uh Alexandro. Oh uh basically I would I would uh mention that what we've seen during most of the pandemic until there was a turning point in which the economy started to pick up was that the working capital of most of of SMEs and and corporates had been going down. So there is an effect of replenishing working capital as the economy picks up, and that's uh basically what we are supporting. In terms of the adverse selection, which I believe is the second part of your question. We are focusing on on c first on our own cats and helping them take off and regain much of the economic activity and in many sectors we're seeing that the level of economic activity is backed with pre pandemic levels and in some sectors even beyond that. So the first focus in is on trends that we know on sectors which we've operated on and the value chains that we've worked in. The other focus is really supporting a pickup in some sec export oriented sectors, for example meat packing, which are really picking up and are showing good progress too. So so we believe that there is significant room for growth from, as Patisha pointed out, very low credit penetration levels. Uh in addition, uh um in order to uh to to uh control um um let's say uh con credit risk also uh um a large substantial part of uh in for instance in the case of individuals, a substantial part of our personal loans uh um are given to individuals that collect their salaries in in the bank. It's around seventy percent of all person all uh personal financing in uh is is is uh is with uh you know with um debiting their their their accounts at the bank. So this this also uh lowers uh let's say an adverse selection. And for enterprises, for corporations, um I I also say in addition pro in complement to what Alejandro mentioned, is that uh we we do we continue to do a lot of uh cash flow uh cash flow based financing which is um uh by itself uh you know i don't it's a way of controlling risks. Um uh but inflection points I think we need to wait a a truly inflection point. I think we'll we'll we will reach it in twenty twenty twenty twenty twenty twenty three with a politic political change is my opinion. Um that's very clear. Thank you. Uh and I actually have a follow up um from from the previous question on the FinTech um uh uh landscape. Um I understand you um talked about Walla uh and what I wanted to understand um is that uh you um showed us that you have around five hundred thousand uh um digital customers. Um but when you compare with Umwala, um they already issued more than two million um um prepaid cards. Um and so I wanted to understand here um is there a strategy from from you to um some growth lower the um number of um clients um may maybe try to monetize them faster um or are you um still aiming um at um adding clients in a faster manner in the coming quarters? Yes, you know what one thing that you have to bear in mind when you look at these qu uh these figures, Gabriel, is is whether these operations are making money or not and how long it will take to monetize all this customer acquisition. What we've seen in financial services is just recruiting clients is not enough to be able to have a sustainable strategy for the time. This is why we've we we emphasize in our strategy the ability of having the right funding, particularly in the Argentine environment. And secondly, in trying to have uh a a uh principle or uh an integral relationship uh cross selling several products. Uh we we approach this this segment with this more comprehensive view and we we aim absolutely at having a this this relationship of uh you know several products with the right funding to be able to uh drive uh growth. We believe that that the cost to income um proportion it would be much better and that the leverage we can have on our capital over the deposit base that we would capture would allow us to scale adequately with with a very um efficient model. All right, thank you so much. Thank you, Gabriel. Our next questions come from Rodrigo and Hestor from our partners. Hello Rodrigo, go ahead. Hi, good morning and thank you for the opportunity. Um I have a question regarding the the income tax rate. If you could explain part of the reasons behind the the highly effective tax rate and what should we expect going forward and then have a a follow up. Maria know do you want to go on that? Yes, I I can comment on that, uh Rodrigo. Um for for the income tax uh rate um we have um two two main sources uh that that increase the effective uh tax rate. You know the statutory inc income tax rate is thirty five percent, but there are certain differences between the uh statutory income segment and the income segment for tax return. The main differences arise from the value of uh fixed assets acquired before twenty fifteen. Uh that defense uh are are permanent, uh so they create uh an an increase in cost uh as the as the income uh for income tax purposes is higher uh than our profits before income tax in our statutory uh income statement. And second and um probably more important, uh have to do with um with referred tax assets and tax laws carry forward which they are not according to the income tax law, they are not adjusted and they are they don't accrue uh any interest. So we have uh mainly as you do, we have one point two billion pesos in in defer tax assets and tax loss carry forward and these assets uh lose value over time uh with inflation. Uh so that loss of value as it relates to income tax according to IFRA is recognized in the income income tax line item. So that increases the charge in the income tax line item and creates in turn a an a higher uh effective tax rate. Both effects have a larger impact when profit before income tax is lower. And we had as last year, a profit before income tax of four billion pesos, this impacts would only increase effective tax rates maybe from thirty five percent to forty percent. But when profit before income tax is lower, it has a greater impact and it's attorneys uh up to one hundred percent eventually. Okay, thank you. Uh and then if I may I have a a more strategic question and maybe to to Patricio. I w I would like to know very briefly what makes him uh more enthusiastic about the future of the industry and what concerns him the most about today's Argentina banking system? Well uh I think that uh um the financial the financial industry is is bearing um is bearing the the the let's say the the cost of of the the uh an economy which is not in in equilibrium. And uh and uh the um what uh of course what uh worries me is that uh the let's say uh main business which is providing loans to the private sector um has diminished over the last three years. Um and you can see this in the loan to deposit ratio which is a m minimum uh in historic levels uh and and I think it reflects what is happening in the financial industry as a whole. So it's there's lack of demand uh and um and also uh uh there's another aspect which also worries me is there is lack of sales. So uh it's uh and the lack of sales is it's has also to do with uh with the with the absolute lack of confidence in our in our currency. We we we have a we we we have a confidence problem, we need to uh get clear signals for investment, clear signals signals for redire re deregulation, uh clear signals for export industries, clear signals for for for having an equilibrium in uh in a monetary I mean a in the monetary um uh uh policies in order to to have a currency that uh I mean that basically is good to lower inflation. The part of the enthusiastic now. For me? The first question was what makes you enthusiastic? Well I what makes me enthusiastic is is basically I mean my enthusi enthusiasm I think has to has basically um is related to uh let's say um if um I think if there is a what we have seen on the political side now is that I think uh is that a request of the society to have a more pro market uh a political economy and uh and uh I hope that uh they will I mean the government will will hear these requests of uh of of the of of the society to to have a pro more pro market stance. Thank you very much. Thank you, Rodrigo. Good morning, Juan. Go ahead. Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is related to NIM and the second one related to the international expansion. So in terms of NIM, you mentioned that you expect name pressure to continue given the low gross uh loan demand and regulations. So my question there is does this quarter reflect the full regulatory pressure or can we expect MIM to continu to to go down in the in the coming quarters? And related to that, how is how is the bank working to limit the new pressure? And the second question related to international expansion, can you help us understand the strategy for expanding outside Argentina. Are there any goals that you can share with us and also can can the bank free can the group freely move capital outside the country with the current regulations? Okay. Um okay. Uh let's let's first uh um uh answer the uh about the names. Uh Mariano will help but this simply I would like to s state that uh there is a pressure, there's a continuous pressure of news uh and mainly to do uh with uh the punitive regulations of the central bank uh but also uh it has a lot to do with the lack of demand of loans. Uh when uh loans resumes it will help us uh definitely it and to to to let's say it's uh better means. But uh you want to do you want to answer the first question on on in Mariano. Sure, Patricio. Um hello everyone. Um well in effect uh this quarter we are seeing the the full impact of uh central bank regulations and also an an adverse um agroeconomic environment. So we have uh very negative interest interest rates uh with the leaks uh paying uh thirty thirty eight percent interest rate, uh request thirty point five and that compares with an inflation of more than fifty percent last whole month. Uh so so this uh this leads also to a very low credit demand and in that in that environment uh we have uh regulated uh floors for high deposits because we wouldn't normally lower the interest rate on the pay on time deposits so we make positive uh trend. Uh so it's a it's a very challenging environment and we are seeing uh definitely the the the folding part of it in this quarter where as you can see we have the uh the the the lowest team in the last uh five quarters. Uh so uh regarding the the second part of your question, uh what we can do to to sustain and increase technology in the future. Uh we we aim to uh to grow in in deposits, not uh regulated ten deposits but from maybe for instance in in savings accounts and corporate uh current accounts uh we have increased the the average volume of uh corporate economic accounts this quarter and we are seeing that also uh in the first month of the of the fourth quarter. So so that is uh very important. Um also then uh uh we need to increase our our loan portfolio as rate remand demand resumes. We've seen um in the last quarter particularly the uh the third two uh we we see uh we saw a growth of five percent in real terms uh so so we gain a bit of uh market share there and it's still uh in the in the SMEs program the subsidies uh loans uh that are mandatory so it it doesn't have uh still uh a a very large positive income in in new but uh uh it it's still uh a long road w where which we replace uh central bank instruments by uh loans to the private sector and that's what we we intend to to do in the future and we uh expect twenty twenty two to be a year where we'll we resume growth above inflation uh and that will lead us to to increase needs. In terms of uh the the international expansion that we we want to pursue beyond Argent um Argent I mean we're creating revenues beyond Argentina um uh at Udo Servicios uh which is basically um a platform to deliver um uh health health services and also services, well being services to to individuals. We we will uh we we will start uh deploying uh we've reached a re agreements uh with two companies uh um Europe Assistance and uh Assistil is an Argentine company uh that uh provides health services and um Europe Assistance is more dear to well being services in in the home of each of an individual. So with both companies we we reached an agreement to start deploying in part why uh in a lot of the s in the second second quarter of uh of uh twenty twenty two and um basically what they are doing is they are they will be funding they will be providing uh commercial I mean commercial funding uh um uh which uh uh this um i it's it's this is basically we will use this funding in order to deploy uh m um digital marketing in order to attract customers. Um in and it's gonna be like like um uh our first uh um bridgeheads in in in Latin America beyond Argentina. And from there on we could we we we plan to continue to to to go other countries. Uh it's um it's a business that uh I mean our goal there our goal in in U Do servicios is uh in in in three years from now to re to to uh let's say tr to have two hundred thousand customers in um in five countries. Um so uh this this will give us um um Um uh they uh a million customers in in three years, this is what we plan to to to get and uh and it it this is basically uh uh um just to give you an idea, in Argentina with the same lines of businesses we already have three hundred and twenty thousand three hundred and twenty thousand customers that we developed providing these services. So we believe that we can reach that and uh and and get revenues beyond Argentina. Um then um for invertir online um invertir online is uh is um uh we we are working on a on a on a on a business plan. Uh we already said that uh we we requested an authorisation to in uh the Central Bank of Uruguay to to pursue um um um a regional to to provide regional um uh investment services for in Latin America, excluding Brazil, uh for particularly for the providing um services or investment services in the US market. Um and so we are working on on the on the technology technological um platform to deliver this uh in uh from Uruguay from with this license of uh proper license in Uruguay. Um and in addition to in addition we we in order to to start our deployment we already have secured um um uh around um five million dollars that are already in uh in uh in uh and a holding out of Argentina. So basically um uh dividends that were paid from from uh inver inverted online in Argentina and they they they were paid and basically they are in uh in uh in a holding outside of Argentina we we will start exploiting this uh with with with this um capital. That's you uh Juan uh our next Hello, good morning Alejandra. Hi, good morning and thank you for the opportunity. Um I have two questions if I may. Uh the first one is related to the costs. I mean I was positively surprised by by the performance this quarter and and given um that the outlook is challenging on the income side, I was wondering what to expect going forward, especially given the the right sizing that you've that you've been doing. Okay. Um do you want to go on that then Mariano or you prefer I can start and then Mariano correct. Um hello. Um we see lots of opportunities for uh enhancing Many have been triggered by the acceleration of the adoption of digital and automated channels throughout our branch network. The others come from the digital transformation process we've been discussing over the large quarters, and all these boil down to a reduction in the total amount of headcom we need to operate and a reduction in the total amount of branches. We also see opportunities on the revenue side because the digital capabilities are giving us an opportunity to expand our footprint without actually having to deploy a physical branch network. So this combination is is helping, as you've noticed, and we foresee this trend to continue throughout twenty twenty two. Okay, but but in terms of of of a level of efficiencies that we should be looking at for the next couple of quarters? Well, um, you know, you've seen then um a six percent increase sorry decrease in in headcount and I think that we will probably be around that level moving forward. Okay. Okay, I think yes Alejandra also to um to uh to to complement what Alejandro said also uh at U two uh U two is is is also in the middle of a huge transformation from a consumer finance company uh where business was done uh mainly in the traffic of of supermarkets uh and uh towards um um uh a digital banking full digital banking service and that entails a change of the way we do business even in the um in for instance the case of supermarket uh the the people that are in the supermarket, we will we will we will foster a much more um let's say um uh um the the way clients they they interact will be much more digital and so this in in we will see in uh in in twenty twenty two um um A substantial efficiency in terms of head count also at U2 because of this transformation that we we are working on. And so you will see this in overall Group Superviel uh we have um um um um significant reduction of headcounts in twenty twenty two besides the bank. Thank you. I if if I may I follow uh up follow up on that. Um I mean there's a huge demand for for for digital jobs and and um digitally native uh workers. How are you how are you seeing uh the market there? How are you competing with the fintechs and also with with the the so called uh blue labor with with other companies from abroad coming and and and taking the opportunity to to hire people uh at the group chip swap. Alright that's a very good question. Uh Alejandro you you want to uh two to big techs and also with international companies that are hiring Argentine talents uh for work abroad. So so it is becoming challenging. What we've done is uh basically um first uh focus on the key areas where we're getting most attrition. This is basically digital channel uh talent as you pointed out. We're working there on value proposition and uh there are several aspects of the way that we work and the ability to uh address the different needs that our uh workforce hard under these challenging times. So part of it has to do with adjusting the the way we work and the workplace. Second, as I mentioned before, the value proposition, adjusting it to market and keeping track on on these changes, but also introducing other um different uh alternatives in the way in which we compensate and in the way that we motivate. Some of these are basically out of focus focus groups that we do with with the teams and also require a greater involvement in the digital transformation of some of the seniors of the organization to help uh the new talent navigate. So um we think that this this problem will actually become greater over time because the transformation we're doing at Super Liel is getting more and more uh visibility. So we we are getting prepared for it and we are having um so far uh good success in retaining some of the cases that that um have been brought forward. But but it is getting tougher going forward. Okay, thank you. May I do a third one? Yes. Short one. What what's the minimum level that you feel comfortable in terms of coverage. Uh if I can I can comment on that. Um as you know we work with expected those models according to to a IFRA. Um it's so there's no uh l like like a magic percentage like to like say one hundred percent or one hundred and fifty. Uh it will depend uh on on the loan portfolio, uh on the mix of that portfolio, the the outlook, uh looking forward. You know that that's also a component of the expected law, uh that is the the the forward looking uh part of of of the model. Uh so we are we are comfortable with the level we have uh right now. Uh we we think it's it's adequate as we thought it was uh adequate to have uh a larger coverage in the past uh where we had uh less visibility um and and also the the automatic risk coding was in place. Uh so leaving forward I would expect to gradually uh decrease coverage as as we as we feel for comfortable um um Um uh using the the COVID specific provisions that we created during last year. Uh last year we had uh two point four two point four billion uh COVID specific provisions, now they decrease to one point six million and that should uh decrease in the futures of of course always that that the situation uh gets back to normal. Okay, thank you. Thank you Alexandra. Thanks uh for all your questions as well. Uh we have reached today's uh question and answer session. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you uh for the interest in our company. We look forward to meeting more of you over the coming months and providing financial and business updates next quarter. In the interim, we remain available to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you and stay safe and healthy.",

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide four for our earning presentation. When we go to rebound inaudible this quarter, we continue to operate under challenging market conditions with high inflation, negative interest rate, and interest-free loans at historical lows and growing inflation. In addition, inaudible regulations inaudible reporting and attributing inaudible in 2021, compared to 348 in the prior quarter. It was inaudible by lower provisions reflecting a strong right here in collection policies along with a inaudibleeconomic activity. Somewhere inaudible expenses, also contributed to this performance when we continue to reside our inaudible and executing our inaudible challenge information strategies. Our comparative efficiency rating excluding inaudible severance payments on early retirement charges improved to 31% inaudible from 72% in the second quarter. inaudible by it's own revenue base. Looking at the first nine months of the year and excluding recurring charges, expenses were down nearly 7% year on year. We also maintain a solid cash inaudible with year one rating of 14.1% at quarter end and a inaudible current environment and implement inaudible strategic transformation. Patricia will provide, shortly, an update of our progress on our inaudible information agenda followed by a video which will present our key inaudible and inaudible. Now please turn to slide five. We expanded our inaudible by 5% inaudible in this level and recovering market share. New growth was mainly driven by higher mandatory credit inaudible which rose to inaudible accounting for over 30% of total loss this quarter from inaudible in the prior quarter. Short term finances corporate also contributed to low growth along with inaudible, personal loans which released the inaudible 10% sequentially. Now, moving to funding on slide six. inaudible remained relatively stable quarter on quarter at 63% with liquidity at solid levels. inaudible sequentially through the inaudible funding from the management and corporation accounts. According to policy, we're stable quarter on quarter. inaudible were at 1.5% sequentially, accounting for plenty, over 11% of total deposits. Turning to slide seven, inaudible two percentage points to 17 from 19% in the second quarter. inaudible returns inaudible over management with main inaudible when inflation inaudible given that inaudible price index inaudible continued to attract pressure on it. Turning to inaudible quantity on slide eight. Our strong and inaudible collection policies together with improved economic conditions allowed us to release a portion of the COVID-19 specific provisions created last year. As a result, loan provisions declined to 1.4 billion from two billion in the prior quarter. In turn, customer net improved to 3.5% from 5.7% in the second quarter. At quarter end, COVID-19 and it's provisions amounted to 1.6 billion pesos versus 2.4 billion as of June 30. Our total provision in inaudible is 2.6% in September, about the previous level of 6.4% posted in February 2020. The total inaudible for the quarter increased 20 points sequentially to 5.5% inaudible in July. Sequential increase was mainly driven by consumer segments. inaudible we saw an increase in the inaudible of the great period with a consumer finance inaudible nearly 21% this quarter end. inaudible. To another extent, NDL also increased to 5.1% from 2.2% inaudible segment inaudible of customers performing with inaudible, but none performing with inaudible. By contrast, corporate is a means and bank credit card also is sequential and appropriate inaudible. Slide, uh, slide nine. Although payments remain suspended, you do inaudible that inaudible are the main drivers of our business for the remainder of the year and 2022. Starting with inaudible loans, we expect to see both inaudible in 2021 inaudible super loans and allow inflation in 2022. Both expect 20 year with deposit growing above inflation fostered by inaudible and to a lower extent by interest rates inaudible. We expect deposits to continue growing above inflation, driven by the same strength. With inaudible quality, participation, NPL'sinaudible quarter are expected to remain stable or decline in fourth quarter. We also expect coverage to decline as COVID-19 provisions are used or reversed. inaudible is expected to be below 2020 and 2019 levels, but in line with historical levels of 5-6 %. inaudible margin for the remainder of the year 2022 inaudible higher cost of funds presented from the impact of the the prior interest rate inaudible for loss. This is upset by higher inflation inaudible demand and inaudible pick up from historical low. Personal and interest expenses are likely to grow with inflation. inaudible reflecting economic struggle in inaudible competition is from the execution of our inaudible and extension of the turnover tax inaudible and inaudible, we continue to negatively impact expenses. At the same time, inaudible is expected to grow in languid inflation. Finally, we continue to expect inaudible liquidity to remain at comfortable levels, supporting those inaudible. 100% of our capital is inaudible inflation. Now, let me call inaudible who will provide an update for our strategic initiatives. Patricio, please go ahead. Thank you, Mariano. You heard Mariano present our financial results and views for the remainder of the year in 2022. In this challenging context, we remain fu-fully focused on advancing on our transformation strategy. Starting with the transformation of our branch channels, using best and fast technologies to facilitate inaudible banking and expand inaudible everywhere and anytime banking. First, digitized customers have increased consistently over the past two years and were up 76% since March last year. Second, keeping a strong focus on the customer experience, we recently deployed an upgraded version of the advanced mobile app, rated 4.4 on the place or, and 4.3 in the App store. Third, with a successful performance of our inaudible for individuals in the province of inaudible, we're starting to scale this high inaudible model to other regions and segments and expanding our footprint while offering a superior customer experience combining the strength of our face to face approach with the high efficiency of our virtual app. This also allow us to expand our footprint throughout national territory without inaudible. And fourth, the, in the past four months, we're modernizing an expanded services to inaudible and related segments in 11 branches that were previously, solely dedicated to senior citizens. And expect, we expect to convert four additional branches to multi-segment format, format, before year end. Now please turn to slide 11. At the same time, we have been introducing technology for the innovation of our senior citizen branches because inaudible banking for these customer segment, which was indeed advanced in terms of digital adoption. Let me share some examples of the success of these initiatives. To allow for extended banking hours and higher efficiencies, we enlarged our 24 hour lobbies, increasing the number of biometric cash dispensers located in these lobbies. As of September 27, disciplinary-dispensers in our 24 hour lobbies, 34 lobbies, accounted for 53% of total cash dispensers, up for around 24% before the pandemic and nearly 40% a year ago. As a result, the number of transactions at human tellers declined sharply to 2% of total transactions from 11% a year ago and 22% before the pandemic. We are also seeing continued adoption of our digital, digital app dedicated to senior citizens with 90 days locked in customers through the app increasing over 144% when compared to first Q 2020. Please turn to slide 12. As you can see, we're also advancing on the right section of our branch network. The introduction of best in plastic technologies to extend service hours, facilitating self-service banking in some branches while converting others to full service home which is allowing us to enhance customer service and productivity. As a result, we closed one branch in second quarter and then closed another 16 between the remainder of 2021, the next year, subject to essential bank authorization. inaudible allow us to lower inaudible by nearly 6% here in Europe. Please now turn to, to slide 13. Our IT infrastructure strategy includes creating an, an APR environment to accelerate service development and come to market and our customer journey. In the first nine months of the year, we added a total of 95 APIs and plan to add another 153 by the end of 2022. We are also advancing inaudible data driven enterprise while migrating technology to a hybrid multi-cloud to provide the inaudible to grow efficiently. By October 20, 20% of our technology was already, already migrated to the cloud and we expect to reach 30% by year end. With 70% of our technology anticipated to be migrated to the cloud by the, the end of year 2024. Please now turn to page, page 14. We are also making pro-progress on, on the current, our growth strategy for inaudible. Next week, we are formally launching inaudible Mobile inaudible that will enable us to grow our-… of savings accounts that will enable us to grow our client base and attract low-costing, low-cost funding at this subsidiary. After a successful soft launch in last August, IUDU has already opened 230,000 accounts among current customers. IUDU clients also have access to a wide range of digital banking services, insurance and wellness offerings. And we will continue adding new features and services in the coming months. We also have made progress in our goal of diversifying revenue origination beyond Argentina by deploying wellbeing and health services under the B2C or B2B to C format in certain countries in Lat-Am, excluding Brazil. We are, in this sense, advancing with Grupo-assisted and Europe assistance, uh, to implement in second quarter 2022, B2C wellbeing and health services in Paraguay. The offering will consist of health, dentistry, pharmacy, medical emergency, and veterinary, ve- ve- veterinar- veterinary services. Services will be marketed through the IUDU Wellness marketplace, which will host a varie- variety of well, wellness services under one platform, offering customers a simple and convenient and seamless experience. Additional information on the progress of our digital KPIs and, and a more detailed description of all these initiatives and timeline can be found in the back of our earnings call presentation. In summary, we will, we, while we saw improved activity in the quarter, near-term profitability is expected to remain impacted by overall weak credit demand, pressure on NIMs, together with the cost and investments required to, to continue building our ecosystem and execute our transformation strategy. This strategy positions us to retain and enhance our customer relation, or our current customer relationships while attracting new digital clients and driving operational efficiencies in the longer term, when demand resumes. Now before opening the call to Q&A, let me turn the call to Atilio Dell'Oro, one of our Board members and responsible for, for leading our EC- ESG strategy, who will provide an update on, of our initiatives and ambitions on this front. Uh, Atilio, please go ahead. Thank you, Patricio. At Grupo Supervielle, we understand the need for more long-term and more sustainable view of shareholder value creation. Until not long ago, a more philanthropic vision prevailed in our corporate social responsibility model. As of 2019, CSR is integrated into the group's core business through a responsible management model, oriented towards sustainability. CSR is no longer a goal contribution per year to NGOs. It is a way of doing business. We believe that how, not just what, matters in the business value creation process. In this new phase, we have assumed a commitment to grow sustainably, protecting the environment and pursuing our business strategy in a socially responsible manner. We believe that enhanced disclosure of nonfinancial information such as environmental, social and governance-related factors satisfies the growing demand for an alignment of corporate's financial performance with the company's performance in nonfinancial factors. To develop our ESG strategy, we have defined our pillars and commitments shown on slide 15. In slide 16, we present our ESG recent and most relevant highlights. In terms of our environmental responsibility, we work to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment by implementing a responsible environmental management system. We have been measuring our carbon footprint since 2019, and we compensate our greenhouse emissions to protect forest ecosystems. Renewable energy represents 44% of total energy consumption in our buildings. In addition, we have implemented a plastic waste management program to eliminate single-use plastics, and we have reduced paper consumption by 46 com- percent compared with 2019. Note that 75% of the paper consumed internally is responsibly sourced paper to protect forest ecosystems. In connection with social responsibility, we focus on financial education, which is the gear shift of financial inclusion. More than 88,000 senior citizens clients attended digital literacy and financial education programs conducted in alliance with 21 universities in seven provinces and the City of Buenos Aires. 95% of transactions are conducted through our digital and automated channels. Diversity is also a key aspect of our social responsibility. In 2021, we launched a comprehensive program to promote a diverse and inclusive work culture. We also work on more than 26 corporate financial programs, with focus on education, childhood, senior people and civic strengthening initiatives. With respect to our responsibility with good governance, we believe a robust corporate finance, uh, is, uh, is key for guaranteeing a sustainable business model over the long term. Ernst & Young recently conducted a risk regulatory assessment and verified 97% compliance with the inventory of obligations applicable to Grupo Supervielle. The area of compliance monitors the correction, prevention program and our whistleblower hotline allows employees, suppliers and clients to report any malpractice, unlawful or unethical behavior. We have defined quantifiable metrics for our sustainability initiatives. On slide 17, you will see the key and most prevalent ESG goals for 2024. In relation to our environmental responsibility, we have set the following goals. We will continue to measure our carbon footprint, setting a goal of 6% reduction and 50% carbon compensation to protect millenary forests. And on the other hand, a target of 45% of our total portfolio screened and analyzed through our environmental and social risk policy. With respect to our social responsibility, we have set the following goals. 33% of women in senior executive positions by 2024 and 120, 000 people attending our financial dedication programs. Finally, our responsibility with good governance goals include publishing fully integrated sustainability report by 2023, prepared according with the Global Reporting Initiative. And in addition, we aim to have 100% of our strategic suppliers submitting a self-evaluation form, assessing compliance with our policies related to human rights, diversity and governance practice. Thank you, Atilio. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you need to be connected to the Zoom platform. We will not be able to take your questions if you are connected from a home line. To ask a question by host, please press the Raise Your Hand button, and press it again to withdraw your questions. You cannot just send your questions in written form via the Q& A box. We would like you to limit your talk to one question and then followup after, uh, afterwards. One moment while we poll for questions. The first question, uh, comes from Ernesto, uh, Gabi- uh, Gabilondo at Bank of America. Please go ahead, Ernesto. Well, thank you, Ana. Uh, good morning, uh, Patricio, Mariano, Atilio. Uh, good morning, everyone. Uh, thank you for your presentation, uh, and for the opportunity. Uh, my, my first question is on, uh, the political outlook in Argentina. Um, after the midterm elections, uh, I would like to know, uh, which do you think are the key challenges ahead? Uh, and if you think there are, like, potential key dates, uh, that the, we should be following? So, that, that's my first question. Um, well, fi- first of all, um, there was a clear, uh, there was a, a clear win of, uh, of, uh, the opposition. And, um, what, uh, I believe that, uh, uh, I mean, the president has announced, uh, that in, in December, uh, this December, they will present a multiyear, uh, economic program, um, in order to, um, to have the, the approval of Congress. And, uh, what, uh, we, uh, expect, um, I mean we, we, we, we know that, uh, there is, uh, a deadline with the IMF. So, there is, there is a short timeframe, uh, for the government to negotiate this multiyear plan in order to, to, to make it, uh, to have more sustainable fiscal policies, FX, more, more realistic, uh, also FX, um, um, levels in order to, uh, enhance, uh, export-oriented industries and to strengthen the, the, the, the, the reserves of the Central Bank. Um, uh, I, uh, what is, uh, not yet, yet really clear is, uh, whether, um, um, there is a, a clear line, uh, in, in the government in order to, to, to, to make, uh, this, uh, let's say, a commitment for this, uh, uh, economic plan. We will see. This is a very, it, it's going to be an in, in, in, interesting period. Uh, but, uh, um, I think also the attitude, what is important is the attitude, yeah, of the IMF, whether they, they will, uh, let's say, uh, allow for, um, uh, sort of a, a mo- a model through, um, uh, economic policy until 2023 or they will be strict in the sense that they want to have, um, a lessening of, of expenditures, public expenditures and, and reduction of subsidies, and so on. So, so, this is, I think, the, the, what we are looking for. I don't know if, uh, you want to add something, Alejandro, on that? I think you, you've hit on most of the points, uh, Patricio. As you said, it's key to understand what the scope and the depth of the agreement with the IMF will be. And, uh, going back to Ernesto's question, as to date, I think that you should follow carefully these talks to be able to establish when an agreement is reached. Perfect. Thank you so much. Then, uh, just a second question on the FinTech, uh, competitive landscape. Uh, I will appreciate if you can share with us, uh, who you see as the main players. Uh, the one I have on top of my mind is Uala. Uh, and how do you think IUDU and your new digital initiatives are against the other FinTechs? Uh, okay. Um, uh, I, I think that, um, uh, the, I mean, Uala basically is, is focusing on, on, on, on providing solutions for people who don't have, uh, bank accounts and, uh, and, uh, they, they are giving, uh, a value proposition on that. Uh, and, um, but, uh, the, I mean, the main, the main problem is that, uh, they don't have deposits. Uh, now, this is the reason why now they, they are applying for, uh, a banking license. Uh, in order to, to, to reach scale in Argentina, uh, you need to have, uh, uh, a license to, to get deposits. And, uh, uh, you can see this, for instance, uh, if you look at the, the size of, uh, uh, the funds that were collected by the, the, the, by, by Mercado Pago in, uh, the, uh, relation to the, the, the fund industry is, is, um, is nearly irrelevant, and they've been working on, on this. Uh, so, this is an en- this is an extreme example that, uh, um, the tran- um, let's say, only, uh, working, uh, with a transactionality, um, as a FinTech player in Argentina is not, is, is, is not, um, uh, they don't, they are not able to, to, to reach, um, um, uh, they need to, to have, let's say, that is a bank, a bank license in order to, to become a player in Argentina because of the restrictions we have in Argentina. Um, uh, in the case of IUDU, uh, IUDU is, uh, is, is transforming itself from a consumer finance operation, uh, fully, uh, almost fully focused in, uh, in providing financial services credit card and personal loans to, uh, people, customers, um, uh, uh, who come to Chango- to the Walmart, uh, Changomas, um, Supermarket stores, uh, towards now, uh, uh, to a full digital service. And, uh, we, for, for our main goal now, now will be to attract deposits, retail deposits. And this will have a significant impact for us, uh, to, um, I, I believe, to, to lower our co- cost of funds and to have a more, much more sustainable business. And I hope, and I think it will impact a lot in, in, in the overall, uh, net, net income revenue of, uh, uh, on capital creation of Grupo Supervielle. I don't know if you want to add something on the FinTechs, uh, Alejandro? I think, I think you mentioned the key issue of funding and access to funding. Uh, I also think that IUDU has done a terrific job at, uh, enhancing customer experience and putting together a very superior product offering. And I think those two things, combined with the strength of, of the funding capability, will, will make a very strong, um, positioning in the market in the next quarters. Thank you, Patricio and Alejandro. Very helpful. Thank you, Ernesto. Uh, our next co- uh, question comes from Gabriel Nobrega at Citi. Hello. Good morning, Gabriel. Please go ahead. Sorry about that, um I was having some technical difficulties. So uh, thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Um, my first question is actually on loan demand, if you could elaborate further, what's driving the higher demand which we are seeing? I know that you are saying in your press release that um it's due to the government programs, um focused on SME's, but I just wanted to understand if you think that we are at an inflection point where loan demand isn't going to start increasing? And then how are you going to be able to control your adverse selection in that scenario? And I'll ask the second question afterwards, thank you. Okay. We, in fact, I mean Gabriel it's real that we are in a very low point of loan demand, inaudible loan demand. We believe that it has maybe to do with the lack of business confidence and also consumer confidence. Um, so, um we need these signals to reignite the loan demand. Having said that, there are certain, um particular enterprises that are export oriented, and they continue to perform well in the economy, and they are… I mean we continue to serve them with uh different kinds of credit, particularly pre-export financing. Um, also there are enterprises that take advantage of subsidized loans to take leasing lines, where we are very strong in leasing, in order to replace equipment. Um, but uh… and for individuals I think it's the same problem uh, very lack… lack of appetite for loan demand. Um, what we see eventually, and it's interesting, in car financing. Because people see, in Argentina today, cars to be a protection of value, so used car financing is driving some… a certain number of loans uh at the bank level and also at inaudible. I don't know if you want to add on that, but I'm good. Oh, um, basically I would mention that what we've seen during most of the pandemic, until there was a turning point in which the economy started to pick up, was that the working capital of most jobs, of SME's and corporates, have been going down. So there is an effect of replenishing working capital as the economy picks up, and that's basically what we are supporting. In terms of the adverse reaction, which I believe is the second part of your question, we are focusing on first on our clients, and helping them take off and regain much of the economic activity. In many sectors we are seeing that the level of economic activity is back to pre pandemic levels, and in some sectors even beyond that. So the first focus is on clients that we know, in sectors which we operated on, and find a change that we work with. The other focus is really supporting a pick up in some export oriented sectors. For example, inaudible, which are really picking up, and are showing good progress too. So, we believe that there is significant room for growth from, as Patricio pointed out, very low credit inaudible levels. Uh in addition… in order to control, let's say, credit risk also, a large… for instance if individuals, a substantial part of personal loans, are given to individuals that collect their salaries in the bank, it's around 70 percent of all personal financing is… you know, with debiting their accounts at the bank. So, this also lowers, let's say, an adverse selection. And for enterprises or corporations, I also said in addition, in complement to what Alejandro mentioned, is that we continue to do a lot of cash flow, cash flow based financing. Which is by itself, you know, it's a way of controlling risk. Um, but inflection points, I think we need to wait. A truly inflection point, I think we will reach it in 2023, with a political change, in my opinion. All right, that's very clear, thank you. And I actually have a follow up from the previous question on the inaudible landscape. I understand you talked about Uala, and what I wanted to understand is that uh, you showed us that you have around 500,000 digital customers. Um, but when you compare with Uala, they already issued more than 2 million prepaid cards. And so I wanted to understand here, um is there a strategy from you, to grow the members of clients, maybe try to monetize them faster? Or are you still aiming at adding clients in a faster manner in the coming quarters? You want to answer? Yeah yeah. You know, what one thing that you have to bear in mind when you look at these figures Gabriel is whether these operations are making money or not, and how long it will take to monetize all this customer acquisition. Um, what we've seen in financial services is that recruiting science is not enough to be able to have a sustainable strategy of this time. This is why we emphasize in our strategy, the ability of having the right funding, particularly in the Argentine environment, and secondly, trying to have a, uh a principal or integral relationship, crossing several parts. We approach this segment with this more comprehensive view, and we aim absolutely at having this relationship of you know several products, with the right funding, to be able to drive uh growth. We believe that the cost to income proportion will be much better, and that the leverage we can have on our capital over a deposit base that we will capture, will allow us to scale adequately with a very efficient model. All right, thank you so much. Thank you Gabriel. Our next question comes from Rodrigo Nesto from inaudible. Hello Rodrigo, go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. Um, I have a question regarding the income tax rate, if you could explain part of the reasons behind the high effective tax rate and what should we expect going forward, and then I have a follow up. Mari I know you can go on that. Yeah, I can comment on that. Uh, you know Rodrigo, for the income tax rate, we have too many sources that increase tax rate. You know, the statutory income tax rate is 35 percent, but there are certain differences between the statutory income statement and then for tax return. The main differences arrive from the value of fixed assets acquired before 2018, that differences are permanent, so they create an increasing cost at the income… for income tax purposes, you hire inaudible before income tax in our statutory uh income statement. But the second and probably more important uh has to do with inaudible and as we carry forward, which they are not, according to the income tax law, they are not taxes and they don't accrue any interest. So we have, as many as you do, we have 1.2 billion Pesos in… you first have assets, and start those coming forward. And these are the use values over time with inflation. Uh, so that loss of value, as it relates to income tax, according to whatever is recognized in the income tax line item. So that increases the charge in the income tax line item, and creates, in turn, a higher effective tax rate. inaudible, a larger in but when brought in before income tax, slower, have we had as last year, a inaudible. 4 Billion Pesos, income tax would only increase effective tax rate maybe from 35 percent to 40 percent, but probably before income tax it's lower, has a greater impact, and can turn in up to 100 percent eventually. Thank you. And then if I may have a more strategic question, maybe to Patricio. I would like to know, very briefly, what makes him more enthusiastic about the future of the industry, and what concerns him the most about today's Argentina ranking system. Well, uh I think that the financial industry is bearing, let's say the cost of the… the economy, which is not in a clear groove. And uh, the um… but of course what worries me is that uh… let's say um, a main business which is providing loans to the private sector, um has diminished over the last three years, and you can see this in the loans to deposits ratio, which is a minimum at historical levels. And I think it reflects what is happening in the financial industry as a whole. There is lack of demand, and um also another aspect which also worries me is there is lack of savings. So, uh… and the lack of savings it has also to do with the absolute lack of confidence in our currency. We have a, we have a confidence problem, we need to get clear signals for investment, clear signals with the regulation, clear signals for export industries, clear signals for having an equilibrium in a monetary, I mean in a monetary, uh policies, in order to have a currency that uh, I mean that basically, it gets to lower inflation. The part about enthusiastic. Pardon me? The first question was, 'What makes you enthusiastic? ' What makes me enthusiastic is, is basically… I mean instinct has basically… is related to, uh let's say, if um there is a… what we have seen on the political side now, is I think a request of the society to have a more pro-market political economy, and uh I hope they will, I mean the government will hear these requests of the society to have a more pro-market stance. Thank you very much. Thank you, Rodrigo. Our next question comes from Juan Ricarde inaudible. Good morning Juan, go ahead. Hi, good morning everyone, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions, one it's related to inaudible, and the second one related to the international expansion. So in terms of inaudible, you mentioned that you felt inaudible pressure to continue, even the low uh low demands and regulations. So my question there is, does this quarter reflect the full regulatory pressure, or can we expect inaudible to cont… to go down in the coming quarters? And related to that, how is the bank working to limit the inaudible pressure? And the second question, related to international expansion, can you help us understand the strategy for expanding outside Argentina? Are there any goals that you can share with us, and also can the bank, can the group freely capital outside the country with the current regulations? Okay, um, let's first answer about the inaudible. Mariano will help but quickly I would like to state that there is a pressure, there is a continue pressure of inaudible, and mainly to do with the punitive regulations of the central bank, but also it has a lot to do with the lack of demand of loans. When loans resumes, it will help us, definitely it can, to let in, to have better means. But do you want to, do you want to answer the first question on this Mariano? Sure Patricio. Hello Juan. Well, in effect, this quarter we are seeing the full impact of central bank regulations, and also an adverse inaudible environment. So we have a very negative interest rate, with inaudible interest rate, repo at 36.5, and that compares with an inflation of more than 50 percent last whole month, so uh, this leads also to a very low credit demand. In that environment, we have regulative flaws for deposits crosstalk normally lower, the interest rate you have to pay on deposit, so uh we make positive trends. Uh, so it's a very challenging environment, and we are seeing that there needs to be a pulling back of it in this order, whilst you can see we have a lower theme in the last five quarters, um so regarding the second part of your question, what we can do to sustain and increase inaudible in the future, uh… mm, and increase that in, uh, in the future. Uh, we, we aim to, uh, to grow in the inaudible distance, uh inaudible for this inaudible in, in savings accounts and corporate, uh, savings accounts. Uh, we have to increase the, the average volume of corporate calent-… accounts. This quarter, uh, we are seeing that also, uh, in the front half of the, of the fourth quarter, so, so that is, uh, very important. Um, also then, uh, uh, we need to increase our, our loan portfolio as great reman-… demand inaudible. We've seen, uh, in the last quarter, particularly, uh, the virtue, uh, with the, uh… uh, we saw a growth of 5%, real terms. Uh, so, so we gain a, you know, f-… a market share there. And it's still, uh, in the, in the inaudible program inaudible uh, loans, uh, that are mandatory, so it… that will have, uh, still a, a, a very large inaudible incoming inaudible, but, uh, uh, it is still a long road w- w-… for which we'll replace, uh, several valuable instruments by, uh, loans to the private sector, and of course, we, we intend to, to bring the future. We expect 2022 to be a year where we'll… we resume growth above inflation, uh, and that will lead us to, to increase inaudible. In terms of, uh, the international expansion, that's good. We want to pursue to an Argent-… um, Argent… I mean, recreating revenues beyond Argentina. Um, uh, at inaudible, uh, which is basically, um, a platform to deliver, um, uh, health, health services and also services… well-being services to, to individuals, we, we will, uh, we, we will start, uh, deploying, uh… we reach agree- agreements, uh, with two companies, uh, um, Yorba Systems, and A- Asistir is an Argentine company, uh, that, uh, provides health services. And, um, Y- Yorba Systems is more geared to well-being services in, in the home of inaudible individual. So, with both companies, we've, we've reached an agreement to start deploying, in part inaudible, uh, in inaudible in sec- second quarter of, uh, of, uh, 2022. And, uh, basically, what they are doing is they are… they will be funding… they will be providing, like, commercial f-… I mean, commercial funding, uh, um, uh, which, uh, uh, this, um, it's, it's, it's, it's basically, we need this funding in order to deploy, uh, uh, digital marketing in order to attract customers. Um, in… and it's gonna be, like, like, um, our first, uh, uh inaudible in, in, in Latin America beyond Argentina. Um, from there on, we will, we will… we plan to continue to, to inaudible other countries. Uh, it's, um, it's a business that, uh… I mean, our goals are… our goals in, in inaudible is, uh, in, in, in three years from now, to re-… to, to, uh, let's say, t- to have 200,000 customers in, um, in five countries. Um, so, uh, this, this will give us, um, um, uh, say, a, a million customers in, in inaudible countries to get, and, uh, and it… this is definitely, uh… just to give you an idea, in Argentina, with the same lines of businesses, we already have 320,000, 320,000 customers that we developed providing these services, so we believe that we can reach that and, uh, and, and get to revenues beyond Argentina. Um, then, um, for inaudible Online, um inaudible Online is a… is, um, a… we, are working on a, on a, on a, on a business plan. Uh, we've already said that, uh, we, we request an authorization to… in, uh, the Central Bank of Uruguay to, to pursue, um, um, um, original… to, to provide original, um, investment services for in Latin America, excluding Brazil, uh, for… particularly for the, eh… providing, um, services for… investment services in the U.S. market. Um, and, uh, so we are working on, on the, on the technology… technological, um, platform to deliver this, uh, in a… from Uruguay, from b- business license of Ur-… focalizing in Uruguay. Um, and in addition to… in additio-… we, we… in order to, to start our… the government will already have secured, um, um, uh, around, um, $5 million that are already in a, in a, in a, in a holding part of Argentina, so basically, um, uh, dividends that were based from, from, uh, inaudible Argentina, and they, they, they were based… and basically they are in a, in a, in a holding outside of Argentina. We, we will start growing this w- w-… this, um, capital. That's helpful. Thank you. Thank you, eh, Juan. Eh, our next questions come from Alejandra inaudible at the inaudible. Hello. Good morning, Alejandra. Hi, good morning, and thank you for the opportunity. Um, I have two questions if I may. Uh, the first one is related to the cost. I mean, I was positively surprised by, by the performance this quarter, and, and given, eh, that the outlook is challenging on inaudible side, I was wondering what to expect going forward, especially given the, the inaudible that you've, that you've been doing. Okay, um, do you, do you want to go on that, uh, Mariano, or do you prefer crosstalk. I can start, and then Mariano can correct. Um, hello, Alejandra. We see lots of opportunities for, eh, enhancing our efficiency. Uh inaudible have been triggered by the acceleration of digital and automated channels throughout our inaudible network. The others come from the digital transformation process we've been discussing over the last quarters, and all these inaudible to a a reduction in the total amount of head count we need to operate, eh, and a reduction in the total amount of inaudible. We also see opportunities on the revenue side because the digital capabilities are giving us an opportunity to expand our footprint without actually having to deploy a physical branch network, so this combination is, is helping as a blueprint, and we foresee this, uh, trend to continue throughout 2022. Okay, but, but in terms of, of, of a level of efficiency that we should be looking at for the next couple of quarters? Well, um, you know, we inaudible um, a inaudible increase… sorry, increase in, in head count, and I think that we will probably around that level moving forward. Okay. Okay crosstalk. And… yes, Ale- Alejandra, also to, um, to, uh, to, to complement what Alejandro said also, uh, as usual, uh inaudible is, is, is also in the middle of a huge transformation from a consumer finance company, uh, where business was done, uh, mainly in the traffic of, uh, of supermarkets, uh, and, uh, towards um, um, uh, a digital banking… full digital banking purpose. And that entails a change of the way we do business, e- even in the, um, in inaudible of supermarkets, uh, in… the, the people that are in supermarket, we will, we will, we will foster a much more, um, let's say, um, uh, uh… the, the way clients say the inaudible will be much more digital, and so this, in, in… we will see in a… in 2022, um, um, a substantial, uh, efficiency in terms of head count also at inaudible, eh, because of these transformations that we, we are working on. And, uh, so you will see this in, you know, overall inaudible, uh, we have, um, um, um, so- some, uh, significant reduction of head count in 2022. If I had to inaudible. Thank you. I- i- if I may, uh, follow, uh, uh, follow up on that, um, I mean, there's a huge demand for, for, for digital jobs, and, and, and digital native, uh, workers. How are you, how are you feeling, uh, the market there? How are you competing with the fintechs and also with, with the, the so-called inaudible labor with, with other companies from abroad coming and, and, and taking the opportunity to hire people, eh inaudible? All right. It's a very good question. Uh, Alejandro do you, do you want to, uh, to, to inaudible retention of talent, basically. Yeah, yeah, yeah, quite right, Alejandra. It's, it's becoming more and more challenging and, yes, we, we are competing with fintechs, with fintechs and also with international companies that are hiring Argentine talent, uh, for work abroad, so, so it is becoming challenging. What we can is, uh, basically, eh, first, eh, focus on the key areas where we're getting most efficient. This is basically digital inaudible, as you pointed out. We're working, uh, on finding proposition, and, uh, there were several aspects of the way that we work and the ability to, uh, uh, address the different needs that our, eh, workforce had under these challenging times. So, part of it has to do with adjusting the, the way we work at workplace. Second, as I mentioned before, the guiding proposition, adjusting it to market and keeping inaudible on these changes but also introducing other, um, different, uh, alternatives in the way in which we compensate and in the way that we motivate. Um, some of these, um, are, eh, basically, out of focu- focus groups that we do with, with the teams, um, and also require a greater involvement, uh, in the digital transformation of some of the seniors of the organization to have, uh, the new talents navigate. That, so, um, we think that this, this forum will actually in-… become greater over time because the transformation between inaudible is getting more and more, uh, visibility. So, we, we are getting prepared for it, and we are having, uh, so far, uh, good success in retaining some of the cases that, that, um, have been brought forward, but, but it is getting tougher going forward. Okay. Mm, thank you. May I do a third one? Yes, uh… Short one. Eh, wha- what's the inaudible level that you've been comfortable in terms of coverage? Uh inaudible. Yes, I can, I can comment on that. Um, that you know, we work with the, the expected loss models according to, to ac-… inaudible. Um, so there's no, uh, li- li- like, a magic person just, like, to explain what kind of percent or inaudible. Uh, it will depend, uh, on, on the loan portfolio, uh, or on the inaudible of that portfolio, the, the outlook looking forward. You know, that… that's inaudible comprehensive inaudible loan, and that is the, the forward-looking, uh, part of, of the inaudible. Uh, so we are, we are comfortable with the level we have right now. Um, we, we think it's, it's adequate, uh, uh, with us. It was adequate to help, uh, larger corporates in the past, uh, where we had, uh, less inaudible, um, and, and also the… there was a inaudible was in place. Uh, so even in inaudible I will expect to probably, uh, decrease coverage as, as we, as we feel f-… comfortable, um, um, uh, using that inaudible provisions that we created during last year. Uh inaudible we had, uh, 2.4, 2.4 billion, uh inaudible specific provisions. Now, they're increasing by inaudible, and that should, uh, decrease in the futures. Of, of course, always that, uh, situation ge- gets inaudible. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. And inaudible Alejandra… I'm… for your questions as well. We agreed to this question-answer session. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you, eh, for the interest in our company. We look forward to meeting more of you in the coming months and providing financial and business updates next quarter. In the meantime, we remain available to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you, and stay safe and healthy.",

Afterwards, at the Relo Miney, we'll provide an overview of the key elements of our ESD strategy and goals. Maria Noviglia, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Anna. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide four of our earning presentation. While we saw our prebound in economic activity to pre pandemic levels this quarter, we continue to operate under challenging market conditions, with high inflation, negative real interest rates and industry loans at historical lows and growing below inflation. In addition, Central Bank regulations continue to wait on NIM. We delivered sequentially improved results, reporting an attributable loss of sixty million pesos in third two twenty one compared to a three hundred forty eight million pesos in the prior quarter. It was mainly driven by lower load of provisions reflecting our strong underwriting and collection policies, along with a pickup in economic activ.ities Lower breaking expenses also contributed to the performance, but we continue to resign our branch network, accelerate telephone efficiency and executing our digital and channel transformation strategy. Our comparable efficiency ratio, excluding non recurrent severance payments and early retirement charges, improved to seventy one percent this quarter from seventy two percent in the second quarter, also significantly impacted by a low revenue base. Looking at the first nine months of the year and excluding non recurring charges, expenses were down nearly seven percent year on year. We also maintained a solid capital base with year one ratio of fourteen point one percent at quarter end and a strong liquidity to navigate the current environment and implement our strategic transformation. Patricio will provide shortly an update of our progress on our digital and channel transformation agenda, followed by Atio who will present our key ESG milestones and goals. Now please turn to slide five. We expanded our learning book by five percent sequentially, growing above industry levels and recovering market share. Loan growth was mainly driven by higher mandatory credit lines to S and E, which rose to a financial of nearly twenty billion pesos, accounting for over thirty percent of total loans this quarter from a balance of fourteen million pesos in the prior quarter. Short term financing to corporate also contributed to loan growth, along with strong origination in personal loans, which reached the record high in October. US total loans in original currency in turn declined ten percent sequentially. Now moving to funding on class six. The loan to deposit ratio remains relatively stable border on border at fifty-three percent with liquidity at solid levels. Back to deposites increasing the high single digits sequentially, driven mainly by institutional funding from liquidity management and corporate checking accounts. Core deposits were stable quarter on quarter. Dollar deposits in original currency were at 1.5% sequentially, accounting for slide B over eleven percent of total deposits. Turning to slide seven, MIM contracted two percentage points to seventeen from nineteen percent in the second quarter. While GDP growth returns to pre pandemic level allowing us to capture standard growth, over rated man remains weak. This, together with a lower yield and inflation linked mortgages zones, given the disaceleration in the price index, and regulatory controls continues to exert pressure on it. Turning to also quality on file eight. Our strong enterprising and collection policies, together with improved economic conditions, allowed us to release a portion of the COVID nineteen specific provisions created last year. As a result, download provisions declined to one point four billion from two billion in the prior quarter. In turn, cost of risk net improved to three point five percent from five point seven percent in the second quarter. At quarter end, COVID nineteen anticipatory provisions amounted to one point six billion pesos versus two point four billion as of june thirty. Our total provisioning ratio is two that six point six percent in September, above the pre pandemic level of six point four percent post in january twenty twenty. The total NPR ratio for the border increased twenty major point sequentially to five point five percent, but declined after peaking to five point five percent in July. The sequential increase was mainly driven by the consumer finance segments. As anticipated, we saw an increase in delinquency and instalments were due after the expiration of the grace period with, the consumer finance and feel ratio reaching a peak of nearly twenty one percent as quarrellan. To consign delinquency we have timed operate policies as you do so that new originators don't have a better rating. To a lesser extent, NPL also increased to five point one percent from two point two percent at the bank's personal loan segment after the expiration of the grade period and the mandatory reclassification of customers performing with SuperB but non-performing with other banks. By contrast, corporate SMEs and bank credit cards offered a sequential improvement in MPS ratio. Slide nine. Although guidance remains suspended due to sustained and immediate visibility on slide nine, we share our views on the main drivers of our business for the remainder of the year and twenty twenty two. Starting with speculative eliminated loans, we expect to see growth in line or below inflation in twenty twenty one, both commercial and consumer loans, and above inflation in twenty twenty two. We also expect to end the year with deposits growing above inflation, fostered by affects restrictions and to a lower extent by interest rate scores and time deposits. We expect deposits to continue growing above inflation, driven by the same trends. With respect to assess quality as anticipated, NPLs leave this order and are expected to remain instable or decline in following quarters. We also expect coverage to decline as COVID nineteen provisions are used for rebirth. Cost of risk in turn is expected to be below twenty twenty and twenty nineteen levels, but in line with historical levels of five to six percent. In terms of margins, for the remainder of the year and twenty twenty two, we expect means to remain pressured by higher cost of funds resulting from the impact of the plural interest rates on time deposits and subsidized rates on loans. This would be partially offset by higher inflation together with credit demand anticipated to gradually pick up from historical loans. Personal and administrative expenses are likely to grow with inflation, while also reflecting additional restructuring costs and expenses as well as healthcare deficiencies from the execution of our digital and channel recycling. Higher turnover taxes and the extension of the turnover tax reach to the leaks and reports in the city of West Ide will continue to negatively impact expenses. At the same time, the INCAP is expected to grow in line with inflation. Finally, we continue to expect capital and liquidity to remain at profitable levels, supporting long term sustainability. As noted earlier, one hundred percent of our capital is hedged against inflation. Now let me call turn the call to Francis Bartiel, who will provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Patricio, please go ahead. Thank you Mariano. You heard Mariano present our financial results and views for the remainder of the year in twenty twenty two. In this challenging context, we remain fully focused on advancing on our transformation strategy. Starting with the transformation of our branch channels, using best in class technologies to facilitate self-service banking and expand SME reach with a vision of everywhere and anytime banking. First, digitised customers have increased consistently over the past two years and were up 76% since March last year. Second, keeping a strong focus on the customer experience, we recently deployed an upgraded version of the bank's mobile app, rated four point four in the PlayStation and four point three in the after store. Third, with the successful performance of a virtual hub MPTs for individuals in the province of Pan San Luis, we are starting to scale this hybrid model to other regions and segments and expanding our footprint while offering a superior customer experience, combining the strength of our face-to-face approach with the high efficiency of our virtual hub. This also allows us to expand our footprints through our national territory without needing practice. And fourth, in the in the past four months we modernised and expanded services to SMEs and related segments in eleven branches that were previously solely dedicated to senior citizens, and expect we expect to convert four additional branches to multi segment format before year end. Now please turn to slide eleven. At the same time, we have been introducing technological innovation at our senior citizen branches, facilitating self service banking for this customer segment, which was the least advanced in terms of digital adoption. Let me share some examples of the success of these initiatives. To allow for extended banking hours and higher efficiencies, we enlarged our twenty four hour lobbies increasing the number of biometric cash dispensers located in these lobbies. As of September cash December dis dispensers in twenty four lobbies, thirty four hour lobby accounted for fifty-three percent of total country spends that up for around twenty four percent before the pandemic and nearly four forty percent a year ago. As a result, the number of transactions at human channels declined sharply to two percent of total transactions from eleven percent a year ago and twenty two percent before the pandemic. We are also seeing continued adoption of our digital digital app dedicated ninety days locked in customers through the app, increasing over a hundred and forty four percent when compared This turn to slide twelve. As you can see, we are also advancing on the right size of our branch network. The introduction of best in class technologies to extend service hours, facilitating self service banking in some branches, while converting others to full service format is allowing us to enhance customer service and productivity. As a result, we closed one branch in the second quarter and plan to close another sixteen between the remainder of twenty twenty one and next year, subject to central bank authorization. These initiatives have allowed us to lower headcount by nearly six percent year on year. Thisase now turn to slide thirteen. Our IT infrastructure strategy includes creating an API environment to accelerate service development and time to market to transform our customer journey. So in the first nine months of the year we added a total of ninety five ACIs and plan to add another one hundred and fifty three by the end of twenty twenty two. We are also advancing on the implementation of Adal the Data Lake to become a data driven enterprise while migrating technology to a hybrid multi cloud to provide the flexibility to grow efficiently. By October twenty, uh by October, twenty percent of our technology would already already migrated to the cloud and we expect to reach thirty percent by year end, with seven seventy percent of our technology anticipated to be migrated to the cloud by the the end of year twenty twenty four. Please now turn to page fourteen. We are also making progress on deploying our growth strategy for UDO and UDO servicios. Next week we are formally launching Udo Mobile Retail Digital Saving Account that will enable us to grow our current days and attract low casting, low cost funding at this subsidiary. After a successful soft launch in last August, UDO has already opened two hundred and thirty thousand accounts among current customers. Udoo clients also have access to a wide range of digital banking services, insurance and wellness offerings, and we will continue adding new features and services in the coming months. We also have made progress in our goal of diversifying revenue origination beyond Argentina by deploying well being and health services under the B two C or B to B to C format in certain countries in LATAM, excluding Brazil. We are in this time advancing with Grupo Assistir and Europe assistance to implement in second quarter twenty twenty two B2C Wbeelling and health Services in Paraguay. The offering will consist of health, dentistry, pharmacy, medical emergency, and veterinary veterinary services. Services will be marketed through the U Do Wellness Marketplace, which will host a variety variety of well wellness services under one platform, offering customers a simple and convenient and seamless experience. Additional information on the progress of our digital TPIs and a more detailed description of all these initiatives and timelines can be found at the back of our earnings call presentation. In summary, we will we while we saw improved activity in the quarter, near term profitability is expected to remain impacted by overall weak credit demand, pressure on NIMS, together with the constant investments required to continue building our ecosystem and execute our transformation strategy. This strategy positions us to retain and enhance our customer relationship uh our current customer relationships while attracting new digital clients and driving operational efficiency in the longer term when Now before opening the call to QA, let me turn the call to Attila De Doro, one of our board members, and responsible for for leading our EC ESG strategy, who will provide an update on of our initiatives and ambitions on this front. Patrio, please go ahead. Thank you. Patricio. As Grupo Superior we understand the need for a more long term and more sustainable view of shareholder value creation. Until not long ago, a more philanthropic vision prevailed in our corporate social responsibility model. As of twenty nineteen, CSR is integrated into the group's core business through a responsible management model oriented towards sustainability. CSR is no longer a goal contribution per year to NGOs. It is a way of doing business. We believe that how, not just what, matters in the business value creation process. In this new phase, we have assumed a commitment to grow sustainably, protecting the environment and pursuing our business strategy in a socially responsible manner. We believe that enhanced disclosure of non financial information such as environmental, social and governance-related factors satisfies the growing demand for an alignment of corporate financial performance with the company's performance in non-financial factors. To develop our EST strategy, we have defined our pillars and commitments shown on slide 15. In slide 16, we present our ESG recent and most relevant highlights. In terms of our environmental responsibility, we work to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment by implementing a responsible environmental management system. We have been measuring our carbon footprint since twenty nineteen and we compensate our greenhouse emissions to protect forest ecosystems. Renewable energy represents fourteen four percent of total energy consumption in our buildings. In addition, we have implemented a plastic waste management programme to eliminate single use plastics, and we have reduced paper consumption by forty six com per cent compared with twenty nineteen. Note that seventy-five percent of the paper consumed maternity is responsibly source paper to protect forest ecosystems. In connection with social responsibility, we focus on financial education, which is the tier set of financial inclusion. More than eighty eight thousand senior citizens' clients attended digital literacy and financial education programmes conducted in alliance with twenty one universities in seven provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. 95% of transactions are conducted through our digital and automated channels. Diversity is also a key aspect of our social responsibility. In twenty twenty-one, we launched a comprehensive program to promote a diverse and inclusive work culture. We also work on more than twenty-six corporate philanthropy programs with focus on education, childhood, senior people, and civic strengthening initiatives. With respect to our responsibility with good governance, we believe a robust corporate finance is uh is key for guaranteeing a sustainable business model over a long term. As Sun Yang recently conducted a risk regulatory assessment and verified ninety-seven percent compliance with the inventory of obligations applicable to Groupus Perviene. The area of compliance monitors the correction prevention program and our whistle blowing hotline allows employees, suppliers and clients to report any malpractice unlawful or unethical behaviour. We have defined quantifiable metrics for our sustainability initiatives. On slide seventeen you will see the key and not relevant ESC goals for twenty twenty four. In relation to our environmental responsibility, we have set the following goals. We will continue to measure our carbon footprint, set in a goal of six percent reduction and fifty percent carbon compensation to protect millinary forests. And on the other hand, a target of forty five percent of our total portfolio screened and analysed through our environmental and social risk policy. With respect to our social responsibility, we have set the following goals. Thirty-three percent of women in senior executive possessions by twenty twenty four, and one hundred and twenty thousand people attending our financial education programmes. Finally, our responsibility with good governance goals include publishing fully integrated sustainability reports by twenty twenty three, prepared according to the global reporting initiative and in addition we aim to have ten hundred percent of our strategic suppliers submitting a self evaluation form assessing compliance with our policies related to human rights, diversity and governance practice. Thank you, Adelio. At this time we will be conducting the question and answer session. questions by voice, please press the raise your hand button and press it again to withdraw your question. You can also send your questions in written form via the QA box. We would ask you to limit yourself to one question and follow up after after we're going what we follow for questions. The first question comes from Ernesto uh Gami Gamilondo at Bank of America. Please go ahead Ernesto thank you Anna. Uh good morning, uh Patricio, Mariano, Batilio, uh good morning everyone. Uh thank you for your presentation uh and for the opportunity. Uh m my first question is on uh the political outlook in Argentina. Um after the midterm elections uh I would like to know uh which do you think are the key challenges ahead uh and if you think there are like potential key dates uh that we should be following. So that that's my first question. Um well f first of all um there was a clear uh there was a a clear win of of uh the opposition and um what uh I believe that uh uh I mean the President has announced uh that in in December uh this December they will present a multi year uh economic programme um in order to um to have the the approval of Congress. And uh what uh we uh expect um I mean we we we know that uh there is uh a deadline with the IMF so the there is uh a short time frame uh for the government to negotiate this multi year plan in order to to to make it uh to to have more sustainable fiscal policies effects more more realistic uh also effects um um uh levels in order to uh enhance uh export oriented industries and to strengthen the the f the the the the reserves of the central bank. Um uh I uh what is uh not uh yet really clear is uh whether um um there is a a clear line uh in in the government in order to to to to to make uh this uh let's say a commitment for this uh uh economic plan we will see this is a very it's gonna be an inter interesting period. Uh but uh um I think also the attitude what is important is the attitude of the of the IMF, whether they they will uh let's say uh allow for um uh sort of a a mu um mudle through um uh economic policy until twenty twenty three or they will be strict in the sense that they want to have um a lessening of of expenditures, public expenditures and and reduction of subsidies and so on. So so this is I think the the what we are looking for. I don't know if uh you want to add something Alejandro on that? I think you you've hit on most of the points, uh Patricia. As you said, it's key to understand what the scope and the depth of the agreement with the IMF will be and uh going back to Ernesto's question as to dates, I think that you should follow carefully these talks to be able to establish when an agreement is reached. you so much. Then I just a second question on the FinTech uh competitive landscape. Uh I would appreciate if you can share with us uh who you see as the main players. Uh the one I have on top of my mind is UALA. Uh and how do you think Yugo and your new digital initiatives are against the other syntaxes? Okay. Um uh I I think that um uh that I mean Walla basically is is focusing on on on on providing solutions for people who don't have uh bank accounts and uh and uh they they are giving uh a value proposition on that. Uh and um but uh the the mi the main the main problem is that uh they don't have deposits. Uh no this is the reason why now they they are applying for a banking license. In order to to to reach scale in Argentina uh you need to have uh a a license to to get deposits and uh uh you can see this for instance uh if you look at uh the size of uh uh the funds that were collected by the the uh by by Bancado Pago in uh the in relation to the the the fund industry is is um is nearly irrelevant and they've been working on and this uh so this is an e this is an extreme example that uh um the let's say only uh working uh with uh transactionality um as a fintech player in Argentina is not is is is not um uh they don't they're not able to to to reach um um they they need to to have let's say the this a bank a bank license in order to to become a player in Argentina because of the restrictions we have in Argentina. In the case of Udoo, uh Udoo is uh is is transforming itself from a consumer finance operation uh fully almost fully focused in uh in providing uh financial services, credit cards and personal loans to uh people, customers who um uh who come to Tango to the Walmart uh Tango Mass um supermarket stores uh to what's now uh to a full digital service and uh we for for me our main goal now now will be to attract deposits, retail deposits, and this will have a significant impact for us, uh to um I I believe to to lower our cost of funds and to have a more sus much more sustainable business and I hope and I think it will impact a lot in in in the overall uh net net income revenue of uh uh on capital creation of Grupo Superviel. I don't know if you want to add something on the scene text, uh Alejandro. I think I think you mentioned the key issue of funding and access to funding. Uh I also think that you do have done a terrific job at uh enhancing customer experience and putting together a very superior product offering. And I think those two things combined with the strength of of the funding capability will will make a very strong um positioning in the market in the next quarters. Thank you Patricio and Alessandro. Very helpful. Thank you, Ernesto. Our next question comes from Gabriel Nobrega at City. Hello, good morning, Gabriel. Please go ahead. Sorry about that. Um I was having some technical difficulties. So uh thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Um my first question is actually on loan demand. Um if you could elaborate further uh what's driving um this higher demand uh which we're seeing um I know that you say in in your press release that um it's undue um to the government programs um um focused on um SMEs. Um but I just wanted to understand um if you think that um we are at an inflection point uh where loan demand isn't going to um start increasing and um how um are you going to be able to control your adverse uh selection in this uh scenario? And ask a second question afterwards. Thank you. Okay. Gabriel uh it's real that we are in a very low point of low of uh of low demand, credit lone demand, and uh we believe that it has uh mainly to do with the lack of of business business confidence and and uh also consumer confidence. Um so um um we need these signals to to reignite the the the the known demand. Having having said that, there are certain um uh particular enterprises that are uh export oriented and uh and uh they they continue to perform well in the economy and uh they they they are asked I mean they we we continue to to serve them uh with uh with different kinds of credits, uh particularly pre export financing. Um uh also um there there are enterprises that uh take advantage of stock child loans to to to to take uh leasing lines where we are very strong in leasing in order to replace equipment. Um but um um and for individuals uh it's I think it's the same problem. Uh very very very lack a lot I mean lack of uh of uh of appetite for for long demand. Um what we see uh um eventually is uh an an uh an an interest in in car financing because people see Arg in Argentina today cars to be a protection of value. So used card financing is uh is driving um um some um uh a n certain number of loans uh in in in uh at b at bank at the bank level and also at you. I I don't know if you want to add on on that, uh Alexandro. Oh uh basically I would I would uh mention that what we've seen during most of the pandemic until there was a turning point in which the economy started to pick up was that the working capital of most of of SMEs and and corporates had been going down. So there is an effect of replenishing working capital as the economy picks up, and that's uh basically what we are supporting. In terms of the adverse selection, which I believe is the second part of your question. We are focusing on on c first on our own cats and helping them take off and regain much of the economic activity and in many sectors we're seeing that the level of economic activity is backed with pre pandemic levels and in some sectors even beyond that. So the first focus in is on trends that we know on sectors which we've operated on and the value chains that we've worked in. The other focus is really supporting a pickup in some sec export oriented sectors, for example meat packing, which are really picking up and are showing good progress too. So so we believe that there is significant room for growth from, as Patisha pointed out, very low credit penetration levels. Uh in addition, uh um in order to uh to to uh control um um let's say uh con credit risk also uh um a large substantial part of uh in for instance in the case of individuals, a substantial part of our personal loans uh um are given to individuals that collect their salaries in in the bank. It's around seventy percent of all person all uh personal financing in uh is is is uh is with uh you know with um debiting their their their accounts at the bank. So this this also uh lowers uh let's say an adverse selection. And for enterprises, for corporations, um I I also say in addition pro in complement to what Alejandro mentioned, is that uh we we do we continue to do a lot of uh cash flow uh cash flow based financing which is um uh by itself uh you know i don't it's a way of controlling risks. Um uh but inflection points I think we need to wait a a truly inflection point. I think we'll we'll we will reach it in twenty twenty twenty twenty twenty twenty three with a politic political change is my opinion. Um that's very clear. Thank you. Uh and I actually have a follow up um from from the previous question on the FinTech um uh uh landscape. Um I understand you um talked about Walla uh and what I wanted to understand um is that uh you um showed us that you have around five hundred thousand uh um digital customers. Um but when you compare with Umwala, um they already issued more than two million um um prepaid cards. Um and so I wanted to understand here um is there a strategy from from you to um some growth lower the um number of um clients um may maybe try to monetize them faster um or are you um still aiming um at um adding clients in a faster manner in the coming quarters? Yes, you know what one thing that you have to bear in mind when you look at these qu uh these figures, Gabriel, is is whether these operations are making money or not and how long it will take to monetize all this customer acquisition. What we've seen in financial services is just recruiting clients is not enough to be able to have a sustainable strategy for the time. This is why we've we we emphasize in our strategy the ability of having the right funding, particularly in the Argentine environment. And secondly, in trying to have uh a a uh principle or uh an integral relationship uh cross selling several products. Uh we we approach this this segment with this more comprehensive view and we we aim absolutely at having a this this relationship of uh you know several products with the right funding to be able to uh drive uh growth. We believe that that the cost to income um proportion it would be much better and that the leverage we can have on our capital over the deposit base that we would capture would allow us to scale adequately with with a very um efficient model. All right, thank you so much. Thank you, Gabriel. Our next questions come from Rodrigo and Hestor from our partners. Hello Rodrigo, go ahead. Hi, good morning and thank you for the opportunity. Um I have a question regarding the the income tax rate. If you could explain part of the reasons behind the the highly effective tax rate and what should we expect going forward and then have a a follow up. Maria know do you want to go on that? Yes, I I can comment on that, uh Rodrigo. Um for for the income tax uh rate um we have um two two main sources uh that that increase the effective uh tax rate. You know the statutory inc income tax rate is thirty five percent, but there are certain differences between the uh statutory income segment and the income segment for tax return. The main differences arise from the value of uh fixed assets acquired before twenty fifteen. Uh that defense uh are are permanent, uh so they create uh an an increase in cost uh as the as the income uh for income tax purposes is higher uh than our profits before income tax in our statutory uh income statement. And second and um probably more important, uh have to do with um with referred tax assets and tax laws carry forward which they are not according to the income tax law, they are not adjusted and they are they don't accrue uh any interest. So we have uh mainly as you do, we have one point two billion pesos in in defer tax assets and tax loss carry forward and these assets uh lose value over time uh with inflation. Uh so that loss of value as it relates to income tax according to IFRA is recognized in the income income tax line item. So that increases the charge in the income tax line item and creates in turn a an a higher uh effective tax rate. Both effects have a larger impact when profit before income tax is lower. And we had as last year, a profit before income tax of four billion pesos, this impacts would only increase effective tax rates maybe from thirty five percent to forty percent. But when profit before income tax is lower, it has a greater impact and it's attorneys uh up to one hundred percent eventually. Okay, thank you. Uh and then if I may I have a a more strategic question and maybe to to Patricio. I w I would like to know very briefly what makes him uh more enthusiastic about the future of the industry and what concerns him the most about today's Argentina banking system? Well uh I think that uh um the financial the financial industry is is bearing um is bearing the the the let's say the the cost of of the the uh an economy which is not in in equilibrium. And uh and uh the um what uh of course what uh worries me is that uh the let's say uh main business which is providing loans to the private sector um has diminished over the last three years. Um and you can see this in the loan to deposit ratio which is a m minimum uh in historic levels uh and and I think it reflects what is happening in the financial industry as a whole. So it's there's lack of demand uh and um and also uh uh there's another aspect which also worries me is there is lack of sales. So uh it's uh and the lack of sales is it's has also to do with uh with the with the absolute lack of confidence in our in our currency. We we we have a we we we have a confidence problem, we need to uh get clear signals for investment, clear signals signals for redire re deregulation, uh clear signals for export industries, clear signals for for for having an equilibrium in uh in a monetary I mean a in the monetary um uh uh policies in order to to have a currency that uh I mean that basically is good to lower inflation. The part of the enthusiastic now. For me? The first question was what makes you enthusiastic? Well I what makes me enthusiastic is is basically I mean my enthusi enthusiasm I think has to has basically um is related to uh let's say um if um I think if there is a what we have seen on the political side now is that I think uh is that a request of the society to have a more pro market uh a political economy and uh and uh I hope that uh they will I mean the government will will hear these requests of uh of of the of of the society to to have a pro more pro market stance. Thank you very much. Thank you, Rodrigo. Good morning, Juan. Go ahead. Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is related to NIM and the second one related to the international expansion. So in terms of NIM, you mentioned that you expect name pressure to continue given the low gross uh loan demand and regulations. So my question there is does this quarter reflect the full regulatory pressure or can we expect MIM to continu to to go down in the in the coming quarters? And related to that, how is how is the bank working to limit the new pressure? And the second question related to international expansion, can you help us understand the strategy for expanding outside Argentina. Are there any goals that you can share with us and also can can the bank free can the group freely move capital outside the country with the current regulations? Okay. Um okay. Uh let's let's first uh um uh answer the uh about the names. Uh Mariano will help but this simply I would like to s state that uh there is a pressure, there's a continuous pressure of news uh and mainly to do uh with uh the punitive regulations of the central bank uh but also uh it has a lot to do with the lack of demand of loans. Uh when uh loans resumes it will help us uh definitely it and to to to let's say it's uh better means. But uh you want to do you want to answer the first question on on in Mariano. Sure, Patricio. Um hello everyone. Um well in effect uh this quarter we are seeing the the full impact of uh central bank regulations and also an an adverse um agroeconomic environment. So we have uh very negative interest interest rates uh with the leaks uh paying uh thirty thirty eight percent interest rate, uh request thirty point five and that compares with an inflation of more than fifty percent last whole month. Uh so so this uh this leads also to a very low credit demand and in that in that environment uh we have uh regulated uh floors for high deposits because we wouldn't normally lower the interest rate on the pay on time deposits so we make positive uh trend. Uh so it's a it's a very challenging environment and we are seeing uh definitely the the the folding part of it in this quarter where as you can see we have the uh the the the lowest team in the last uh five quarters. Uh so uh regarding the the second part of your question, uh what we can do to to sustain and increase technology in the future. Uh we we aim to uh to grow in in deposits, not uh regulated ten deposits but from maybe for instance in in savings accounts and corporate uh current accounts uh we have increased the the average volume of uh corporate economic accounts this quarter and we are seeing that also uh in the first month of the of the fourth quarter. So so that is uh very important. Um also then uh uh we need to increase our our loan portfolio as rate remand demand resumes. We've seen um in the last quarter particularly the uh the third two uh we we see uh we saw a growth of five percent in real terms uh so so we gain a bit of uh market share there and it's still uh in the in the SMEs program the subsidies uh loans uh that are mandatory so it it doesn't have uh still uh a a very large positive income in in new but uh uh it it's still uh a long road w where which we replace uh central bank instruments by uh loans to the private sector and that's what we we intend to to do in the future and we uh expect twenty twenty two to be a year where we'll we resume growth above inflation uh and that will lead us to to increase needs. In terms of uh the the international expansion that we we want to pursue beyond Argent um Argent I mean we're creating revenues beyond Argentina um uh at Udo Servicios uh which is basically um a platform to deliver um uh health health services and also services, well being services to to individuals. We we will uh we we will start uh deploying uh we've reached a re agreements uh with two companies uh um Europe Assistance and uh Assistil is an Argentine company uh that uh provides health services and um Europe Assistance is more dear to well being services in in the home of each of an individual. So with both companies we we reached an agreement to start deploying in part why uh in a lot of the s in the second second quarter of uh of uh twenty twenty two and um basically what they are doing is they are they will be funding they will be providing uh commercial I mean commercial funding uh um uh which uh uh this um i it's it's this is basically we will use this funding in order to deploy uh m um digital marketing in order to attract customers. Um in and it's gonna be like like um uh our first uh um bridgeheads in in in Latin America beyond Argentina. And from there on we could we we we plan to continue to to to go other countries. Uh it's um it's a business that uh I mean our goal there our goal in in U Do servicios is uh in in in three years from now to re to to uh let's say tr to have two hundred thousand customers in um in five countries. Um so uh this this will give us um um Um uh they uh a million customers in in three years, this is what we plan to to to get and uh and it it this is basically uh uh um just to give you an idea, in Argentina with the same lines of businesses we already have three hundred and twenty thousand three hundred and twenty thousand customers that we developed providing these services. So we believe that we can reach that and uh and and get revenues beyond Argentina. Um then um for invertir online um invertir online is uh is um uh we we are working on a on a on a on a business plan. Uh we already said that uh we we requested an authorisation to in uh the Central Bank of Uruguay to to pursue um um um a regional to to provide regional um uh investment services for in Latin America, excluding Brazil, uh for particularly for the providing um services or investment services in the US market. Um and so we are working on on the on the technology technological um platform to deliver this uh in uh from Uruguay from with this license of uh proper license in Uruguay. Um and in addition to in addition we we in order to to start our deployment we already have secured um um uh around um five million dollars that are already in uh in uh in uh and a holding out of Argentina. So basically um uh dividends that were paid from from uh inver inverted online in Argentina and they they they were paid and basically they are in uh in uh in a holding outside of Argentina we we will start exploiting this uh with with with this um capital. That's you uh Juan uh our next Hello, good morning Alejandra. Hi, good morning and thank you for the opportunity. Um I have two questions if I may. Uh the first one is related to the costs. I mean I was positively surprised by by the performance this quarter and and given um that the outlook is challenging on the income side, I was wondering what to expect going forward, especially given the the right sizing that you've that you've been doing. Okay. Um do you want to go on that then Mariano or you prefer I can start and then Mariano correct. Um hello. Um we see lots of opportunities for uh enhancing Many have been triggered by the acceleration of the adoption of digital and automated channels throughout our branch network. The others come from the digital transformation process we've been discussing over the large quarters, and all these boil down to a reduction in the total amount of headcom we need to operate and a reduction in the total amount of branches. We also see opportunities on the revenue side because the digital capabilities are giving us an opportunity to expand our footprint without actually having to deploy a physical branch network. So this combination is is helping, as you've noticed, and we foresee this trend to continue throughout twenty twenty two. Okay, but but in terms of of of a level of efficiencies that we should be looking at for the next couple of quarters? Well, um, you know, you've seen then um a six percent increase sorry decrease in in headcount and I think that we will probably be around that level moving forward. Okay. Okay, I think yes Alejandra also to um to uh to to complement what Alejandro said also uh at U two uh U two is is is also in the middle of a huge transformation from a consumer finance company uh where business was done uh mainly in the traffic of of supermarkets uh and uh towards um um uh a digital banking full digital banking service and that entails a change of the way we do business even in the um in for instance the case of supermarket uh the the people that are in the supermarket, we will we will we will foster a much more um let's say um uh um the the way clients they they interact will be much more digital and so this in in we will see in uh in in twenty twenty two um um A substantial efficiency in terms of head count also at U2 because of this transformation that we we are working on. And so you will see this in overall Group Superviel uh we have um um um um significant reduction of headcounts in twenty twenty two besides the bank. Thank you. I if if I may I follow uh up follow up on that. Um I mean there's a huge demand for for for digital jobs and and um digitally native uh workers. How are you how are you seeing uh the market there? How are you competing with the fintechs and also with with the the so called uh blue labor with with other companies from abroad coming and and and taking the opportunity to to hire people uh at the group chip swap. Alright that's a very good question. Uh Alejandro you you want to uh two to big techs and also with international companies that are hiring Argentine talents uh for work abroad. So so it is becoming challenging. What we've done is uh basically um first uh focus on the key areas where we're getting most attrition. This is basically digital channel uh talent as you pointed out. We're working there on value proposition and uh there are several aspects of the way that we work and the ability to uh address the different needs that our uh workforce hard under these challenging times. So part of it has to do with adjusting the the way we work and the workplace. Second, as I mentioned before, the value proposition, adjusting it to market and keeping track on on these changes, but also introducing other um different uh alternatives in the way in which we compensate and in the way that we motivate. Some of these are basically out of focus focus groups that we do with with the teams and also require a greater involvement in the digital transformation of some of the seniors of the organization to help uh the new talent navigate. So um we think that this this problem will actually become greater over time because the transformation we're doing at Super Liel is getting more and more uh visibility. So we we are getting prepared for it and we are having um so far uh good success in retaining some of the cases that that um have been brought forward. But but it is getting tougher going forward. Okay, thank you. May I do a third one? Yes. Short one. What what's the minimum level that you feel comfortable in terms of coverage. Uh if I can I can comment on that. Um as you know we work with expected those models according to to a IFRA. Um it's so there's no uh l like like a magic percentage like to like say one hundred percent or one hundred and fifty. Uh it will depend uh on on the loan portfolio, uh on the mix of that portfolio, the the outlook, uh looking forward. You know that that's also a component of the expected law, uh that is the the the forward looking uh part of of of the model. Uh so we are we are comfortable with the level we have uh right now. Uh we we think it's it's adequate as we thought it was uh adequate to have uh a larger coverage in the past uh where we had uh less visibility um and and also the the automatic risk coding was in place. Uh so leaving forward I would expect to gradually uh decrease coverage as as we as we feel for comfortable um um Um uh using the the COVID specific provisions that we created during last year. Uh last year we had uh two point four two point four billion uh COVID specific provisions, now they decrease to one point six million and that should uh decrease in the futures of of course always that that the situation uh gets back to normal. Okay, thank you. Thank you Alexandra. Thanks uh for all your questions as well. Uh we have reached today's uh question and answer session. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you uh for the interest in our company. We look forward to meeting more of you over the coming months and providing financial and business updates next quarter. In the interim, we remain available to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you and stay safe and healthy."

      "baseline" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 Quarter Results Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Martin Cummings, General Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 Quarterly Conference Call. As Darcy mentioned, my name's Martin Cummings and I'm the General Manager Investor Relations. This morning on the call we have Jake Klein, our Executive Chairman, Laurie Conway, our CFO and Finance Director, and myself in our Group Office in Sydney. Bob Fulker, our Chief Chief Operating Officer, and Glenn Masterman, our VP Discovery and Business Development, are dialing in. It has been a tumultuous couple of years and has expected, gold's role as a safe haven during those times has been demonstrated. As the pandemic was breaking in early 2020, we saw gold rise from the low of fifteen hundreds per ounce to an all-time high around twenty seventy in August that year. We started twenty twenty one with the gold price down from its peak at just under US nineteen hundred per ounce. The economies were surging as they emerged from COVID lockdowns and equity markets were printing new highs. Bitcoin was continuing to generate a lot of interest, with some touting it as a new digital gold. And exposure to any metal that ended up in a Tesla was highly sought after. Gold couldn't catch a bit in early twenty twenty one and the sell off was brisk, down to sixteen eighty by March. Gold equities would follow, and by the end of September the G D X index of senior gold companies had fallen about twenty percent year to date, with the GDXJ junior index even lower, down around thirty percent. But in the last three months things have turned. Developing economies are now dealing with soaring inflation, with the Federal Reserve now indicating it will need to respond with rate increases soon. The Omicron COVID variant spread quickly, leading some countries to reintroduce or extend lockdowns and restrictions. And recently Russia and Ukraine tension has Europe on high alert. Bitcoin had an incredible journey in 2021, but has now given back most of those gains. Gold's role as a safe haven is returning and we now trade back up around US eighteen twenty per ounce. For Australian gold miners, the Australian gold dollar gold price also went on a wild ride, but we currently sit within ten to fifteen percent of its all time high. These really are great prices to be selling our product at. And of course copper had a standout year two, rising around twenty five percent. Evolution is well placed to benefit from this with our copper production materially increasing from this month. With that, I'll now hand over to Jake to introduce the December twenty twenty one quarterly report. Thanks Martin. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the call. Thanks for joining us and happy New Year. Despite the industry headwinds, COVID, labor shortages, and unseasonal rainfall, our teams did extremely well to manage the impact. As planned and first articulated to you in July, we anticipate the second half of the year to be materially better than the last six months and are on track to deliver our guidance. Given the first half performance at Red Lake, we expect to be in the bottom half of the production range and between the mid and top end of the cost guidance range. Last quarter, our portfolio was significantly improved by securing one hundred percent ownership of the iconic Ernest Henry Copper Gold Mine. We also concluded the sale of Mount Cardin to Navarre Minerals and whilst retaining exposure to the future of the operation, the sale allows us to focus on our larger, higher margin assets. We continue to be consistent and diligent in the implementation of our strategy of improving the quality of our portfolio and being laser focused about putting ourselves into a position where we can generate sector leading returns on the capital we deploy. In our view, this is the holy grail in our industry and is the true measure of a gold company's performance over the long term. I visited Ernest Henry last week and left very confident that in the December quarter we concluded what is likely to prove one of the most transformative deals in evolution's history. It is an outstanding operation with a great team and terrific geological upside. We look forward to hosting a number of you there for a site visit in due course. The foundations for the transaction were put in place in twenty sixteen when we secured the economic interest in the asset, and since then have built a strong and mutually respectful relationship with Glencore that allowed us to negotiate this deal on a bilateral exclusive basis over the course of a few months last year. Our economic interest delivered seventy nine point five million dollars in cash flow last quarter, and now with one hundred percent of the operation being included from one January, we expect its impact to be even bigger going forward. The CAVE extension pre feasibility study will be a priority, and with intersections four hundred meters below the study area and still open below that, Ernest Henry has a long and very exciting future. Cal performed extremely well and managed to deliver to plan in spite of unprecedented rainfall and COVID interruptions. The Underground Project, which will grow cows production to 350,000 ounces per annum, remains on schedule and budget. I was also fortunate to be able to visit Red Lake in November last year. Due to COVID travel restrictions, this was my first visit since we took ownership of the asset in April 2020. Red Lake is one of the best commercial opportunities I've seen in the gold sector in my career. For the combined purchase price of six hundred and fifty million US dollars, being Red Lake and Battle North, we have secured a district scale tenement tenement position with eleven million ounces of resource and significant exploration upside, seven kilometers of prospective strike with associated mining infrastructure, three mils and $700 million of Canadian tax losses. In time, this asset will be transformed into plus $350,000 ounce a year low-cost producer. This is how values created in our sector. As you will hear from Bob, who has just returned from his third visit in the last five months, progress is being made. Last quarter we, consistently achieved over twelve hundred meters of development each month. As a result of this and other improvements, we are confident of a material and sustainable improvement to production in the next two quarters. We expect this higher production to drive the cost per ounce lower, and I'm looking forward to visiting the operation again with Laurie in the next few weeks. Frustratingly, Mungari remains the only asset in our portfolio that we cann can onot currently visit. We are fortunate to have a good team in Western Australia, have led the Kandana integration, which has gone well, and we are growing increasingly confident about the future and the potential of this operation. Mount Rawdon was impacted by heavy rainfall and was forced to process the low-grade stockpile material. Strategically, we continue to assess the potential of Mount Rawdon to be converted into a pumped hydrogener, which could be a significant contributor of renewable energy to the Southeast Queensland grid at the end of its mine life. This last quarter, the highlights for the discovery team were good intersections at Kew in Western Australia, and also more intriguing and exciting intersections at Red Lake, where there is plenty of open space and interesting geology to discover another high-grade zone. Gwen and his team are also plotting and planning the next phase of drilling at Ernest Henry. Whilst we are managing industry headwinds, we should not ignore the significant commodity price tailwinds. A gold price of over twenty five hundred Australian dollars and a copper price, which going forward will represent around twenty percent of our revenue of over thirteen and a half thousand Australian dollars per tonne. Evolution is well positioned to benefit from this. I'll now hand over to Bob to provide some more detail on the operational performance. Thanks, Jake, and uh good morning everyone. The December quarter saw our drift stabilise at nine point four, the highlight being a thirty five percent reduction in the twelve month moving average at Mungari. The December quarter gold production is the first reported without Mount Carlton's contribution. The quarter's gold production was 148,000 ounces, with a 5% improvement in the oil and sustaining cost to $1,347 an ounce. Despite the challenges faced with above average rainfall and COVID, Cal had a strong quarter delivering 60,000 ounces at an all-insustained cost of $998 an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of $80.6 million. Capital investment ramped up at Cal, with sixty million spent on major projects this quarter. This included twenty-four million on the IWL and thirty-three point five million on the underground development. Underground development rates will ramp up in the March quarter with a second jumbo commencing in December, and the selection of the primary mining contractor is on track for the March quarter. The project remains on budget and on schedule. The RWR stage two deposition has run smoothly throughout the quarter. Ernest Henry produced 21,000 ounces of gold and four point one thousand ounces of copper at an all-insustaining cost of a negative eight hundred and eighty two dollars an ounce. The higher AISC compared to the September quarter is primarily driven, primarily driven by lower copper production due to lower mining planned uh lower planned mining tons. The net mine cash flow remains strong at seventy nine point.5 million, another significant contribution to the portfolio. I'm pleased to say this will be the last quarter reporting Ernest Henry as an economic interest. Integration activities are well underway, and I'm excited to have Er thenest Henry team as part of the Evolution family. The pre-feasibility study for the mine extension below the 1125 RL has commenced and will incorporate the recent drilling results indicating mineralization extends further than assumed in the concept study. Completion of the study is expected in H1 FY23. Moving on to Red Lake, over the past five months I've been on site three times. Each time I see an improvement and step change in performance and develop and delivery. Although still work in progress, pleasingly many key metrics are moving in the right direction. Red Lake produced 20,000 ounces for the quarter, and although their all-in-sustaining cost is not where we need it to be, the operating mine cash flow for the quarter was a positive. And with it and we spent thirteen point nine million in sustaining capital and thirty six point nine million on major capital for future production. For the past couple of quarters I've been talking about development. Pleasingly, during the December quarter, each month was above our long our long-term transformation goal of twelve hundred meters per month. The December quarter was twenty-one percent higher than the September quarter. I expect this to continue, allowing additional mining fronts to be opened. Campbell Mill continues to do achieve new records and approval has been granted to lift the daily throughput restriction of two thousand tons per day for a limited trial in the second half of the financial year to support the Campbell Mill expansions. While still not where we want them to be, there have been significant improvements through the quarter. Stope cycle time has improved by twenty five percent. Stope idle time has improved by 60%. Time to drill per stope has improved by 27%. And slot drilling has halved with the V30 implementation. Stope extraction quality focused has delivered a 19% improvement in stope recovery, a three percent reduction in dilution, and a fifteen percent increase in our oil mine to quarter and quarter. And in December, the grade lifted to four point nine grams per tonne. Looking forward to H2, we're expecting expecting to see a continual improvement in delivery from the underground and the two mills operating. Notable improvements for the second half of the year, uh tons processed will increase with the Red M Red Lake Mill running and the Campbell Mill rate extension. Grade mine is lifting as dilution reduces and plans for early ore from the CYD development continue. Increased tons from Koshna, the transfer haulage locomotion locomotives performance has improved by forty three percent last quarter, and replacement locomotives will be commissioned this quarter, further reducing downtime and increased number of mining horizons and continuing the improvement in stoke design and execution to further enhance our ore delivery and quality. Mandugari is moving forward post integration. For the quarter they produce thirty-four thousand ounces of gold at an all-insustaining cost of eighteen hundred and twenty-nine dollars an ounce and generate an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of twenty point seven million. Oe grade process increased thirty four percent over the last quarter, as the proportion of underground ore in the feed increased from fifty four percent to sixty seven percent. Workforce integration is ongoing with a focus on establishing a one team approach. The sharing of resources across the field has commenced in enabling better deployment of equipment and resources to priority areas, which has been critical as a site navigates high vacancy rates and COVID related impacts. Mount Rawdon produced twelve point four thousand ounces at an only sustaining cost of eighteen hundred forty two dollars an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of eleven point nine million. As previously mentioned, weather significantly impacted access to the pit, resulting in reduced oil movements. As a result, stockpile feed increased, directly affecting gold grade and production. In summary, some great improvements were made at Radlake and Mungari throughout the quarter. The Cal Underground Project continues to hit milestones, and the official ownership of the Ernest Henry Mine has added additional opportunities for the portfolio. Thank you for your time and I'll hand over to Glenn. Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Firstly at our QJoint vanch here in Western Australia, we've advised our partner Musgrave Minerals that we will be taking full management and operatorship of the project, which occurred on January 1st of this year. Recent results from diamond drilling at the West Island Prospect outlined on page fifteen of this morning's report importantly confirmed the potential for high grade mineralisation within individual loads. Drilling has also identified multiple new load structures in the favorable dollarite host in various locations along strike. The geometric relationships between structures and dollarite imply individual loads may be limited by their potential strike length, but remain open at de.pth The Air Corps drilling program has been very important in further delineating the favorable dolorite host and associated golden anomalism along strike from the original West Island drilling. The results have unlocked new areas with the necessary geological ingredients for mineralization to occur up to five kilometers from West Island. One of the challenges with all of our drilling programs, is long delays waiting to receive assay results results in time to inform where to drill next. This is an industry wide issue and is holding back the ability to accelerate drilling programs in the ways we would like to. At Q, we are still waiting on results from five diamond holes and over 70 aircore holes, which restricts our ability to sensibly add additional drilling resources. At Red Lake, two deep holes were completed as wide space step-outs from the original intercept reported last quarter on the Rzone extension. One of the holes intersected high-grade mineralization 200 metres away from the first hole, with the other hole drilling through the structure. However, it did not return significant mineralization. The results reported on page 12 are encouraging because they unlock a large area of real estate that has not been previously drilled along the extension of the R zone structure. Follow up drilling is currently stepping off the high grade intercept in Hole sixty nine to expand the potential scale of mineralization in this area. At Mungari, drilling underground at Kandana and East Kandana continued its concentration on small resource extensions and classification upgrades on future mining areas adjacent to existing development. Step out drilling into the foot wall of the K2 structure from the underground at Hornet has returned further promising intercepts of stacked load style mineralization at Star Trek. Follow-up drilling is underway to understand the significance of eliminated veining in hole twenty-one thirty reported on page fourteen of this morning's report. The geology is similar to what would be expected on the main K two structure at A R HP, which is worthy of priority follow up drilling. At Bernest Henry, we have assessed H two drilling priorities which will be focused on developing all body knowledge for the PFS, along with de-risking areas of the resource that require additional data support before production is scheduled. As Bob and Jake mentioned earlier, strong copper gold mineralization has been intercepted at the four hundred and eighty metre R L and remains open down plunge. With that, I'll hand over to Laurie. Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide a brief update on the financial performance for the quarter as outlined on pages nine and ten of the report. For the group we produced one hundred and forty eight thousand ounces at an all insustaining cost of thirteen forty seven per ounce. This aligns with our guidance where we said the production would increase over the year and the all-in-sustaining costs would trend down from around fourteen fifty per ounce in the first quarter. The AISC was approximately five percent lower than the September quarter. Our focus on portfolio quality is evident in that, on a like-for-like basis, the divestment of Mount Carlton operation reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $28 per ounce this quarter. As our production and cost profile changes in the second half, the cost benefit from this divestment will improve further. Group production and cost guidance remain unchanged. At six hundred and seventy to seven hundred and twenty-five thousand ounces at an all-in-sustaining cost of eleven thirty-five to eleven ninety-five per ounce. With the performance of Red Lake in the first half, we expect to be at the bottom end of the production range and between in the top half of the cost guidance range. In terms of cash flow, we were fairly well in line with plan, excluding the underperformance at Red Lake. We generated two hundred and three million of operating cash flow, which is up four point six percent, and thirteen percent excluding Mount Carlton. On a per ounce basis, our operating cash flow was up ten percent quarter on quarter. This was against a flat gold price and lower copper revenue, where the higher copper price was offset by planned lower copper volumes at Ernest Henry. Net mine cash flow was fifty three million, with our capital programs remaining on plan. We invested around thirty four million dollars in sustaining capital, while major project investment increased to one hundred and fourteen million as projects at Cal and Red Lake progressed. Group capital guidance remains unchanged at one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy five million for sustaining and four hundred and forty to five hundred and five million for major projects. We'll see an immediate benefit of the acquisition of the hundred percent of Ernest Henry, where our AISC will reduce materially in the second half of the year. More importantly, though, our cash flow will be increasing. Based on our guidance and depending on the economy, we have a lot of the copper price achieved in the second half, we expect to realise an additional eighty to one hundred and thirty million dollars of net mine cash flow at Ernest Henry. This will be taken into consideration when determining our interim dividend. As previously announced, during the quarter we successfully priced a US two hundred million dollar US private placement for nine years at very attractive pricing to partially fund the Ernest Henry acquisition. This will be drawn down next month. We ended December with one point one five billion of cash and net debt of four hundred and fifty million. Our unaudited gearing is around twelve point six per% prior to the payment for Ernest Henry in early January. We are on track to be below the twenty nine percent projected at the time of announcing the acquisition, and we expect to quickly be back within our targeted gearing levels and maintain a very strong balance sheet. I look forward to updating you next month on the FY twenty two interim financial results. Thank you for your time this morning and Darcy, please open the line for questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. Your first question comes from David Radcliffe from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. Hi, good good morning, Jake. and team So m uh my question's on Red Lake. The the commentary around mining rates does seem uh you know more optimistic today, which is great, uh especially with respect to I guess the mine efficiencies and dilution and and opening up more mining freights uh fronts. So just trying to think how we should think about you know the high development rates converting into higher mine tons over sort of this year and if you could maybe provide some sort of quantum how that comes through over the next kind of couple of quarters. Uh and then on grade, how we should sort of think about those numbers over the year. Obviously there's going to be the sweetener from Campbell, but you know, when do we from the the operations today, how do we move closer to that reserve grade of six given that you're currently sort of seeing the four? Thanks, David. Uh those are good questions. Um I mean I think we you know we are going through a transformation uh y we've called it a three to five year transformation at Red Lake. Uh the last six months have taught us a lot about the operation. Uh we've focused on the development and we've put we've specifically taken the decision to I suppose sacrifice production over development and getting ready and setting the trunk the transformation up. And we now feel that we've kind of bottomed and we're at a point where you're really going to see improvements in that. So the development rates are up. The improvements in in mining are are getting better. As Bob highlighted and he can talk further to it, you know, dilution has been reduced. Uh we're comfortable that the models are performing. Um we need to open up some of these higher grade areas which are gonna be happening over the next few months. Um so it's a it's a journey. Uh we're on the right path, um and you are gonna see uh material improvements to production and lowering of costs uh in the next quarter and following quarters. Bob, do you wanna add to that? Yeah, thanks uh Jake. Uh David S. Jake said um the expectation is that as we get the development in uh to the new areas and it takes a long time uh to to go out and to open up new areas, then the mining fronts will open up which will help stabilise and increase the the tonnages. We've started to see an increase in tonnages last quarter through the quarter, um although it's not as high as we need it yet, but it's still it's growing. Um a and areas like uh aviation and the like uh they do take a bit of time to to set up so uh I would expect that um over the next couple of quarters you'll start to see those tonnages come in. Uh as gr uh Jake said also on the grade, um, you know, we are getting a lot better um with the refonciliations of of um dilution and um and the like, as I mentioned, all the all the numbers. Um I I expect that over the coming quarters we'll see um that continue to to improve. Drin, did you want to comment on the model specifically? Sure, Bob. I I think um you know one of the things that we're starting to see, David, is that um particularly with our reconciliations so, our our Dom to grade control and our Dom to all reserve. Um we're starting to see an upward tick um you know particularly on the grade front as as we improve, particularly some of the you know the mining related factors as Bob has just described, dilution, recovery. Um and and we've improved our grade control system. So we we are starting to see that upward tick in the grade. Uh and particularly on a three month moving average, it's uh w it's starting to trend into the direction where we need it to be. So we we have confidence uh that the models um you know are performing uh to plan and and we're just aligning that with the the way we're mining and w and um yeah we're confident that we'll start to see that where it needs to be over the next coming quarters. I just uh conclude um that David with a a comment around the fact that we've owned this asset for twenty one months. Um it's only been in the last five months that we've been able to visit the the operation. Uh but when we bought the asset in April twenty nineteen we said our three year goal was to get to a run rate of two hundred thousand ounces of gold uh and then a longer term five year um horizon of three hundred and fifty thousand ounces a year. And uh we are uh committed to delivering that uh on both thirtyx- montsih and sixty month targets. Brilliant. Thanks very much guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Your next question comes from Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. about eighteen months for the PFS. Um just wondering if if this is going to um take on much of the the work that Glencore did or if it'll be kind of a complete recut incorporating that those further depth extensions and I think Glenn you mentioned it was going down to four hundred and eighty metres um and still open beyond. So where potentially could you um would you kinda draw the line on on those depth extensions and and and where this study will kind of finish up. Yes. So the the just to clarify, the study will be um delivered in the second half of this calendar year. So first half of FY twenty three. So we're kind of uh say nine months away t from delivery of that. Um it will build on um the concept study which uh was completed by Glencore. Um I suppose one of the things which we found intriguing as we've looked at the concept study is that it was uh determined really on the basis of um minimizing the capital expenditure which meant that the depth extent of the concept study went down to as far as the decline could go and you could cruck material up. Uh so it wasn't constrained or limit uh determined by geology, it was more determined by how far can we develop how deep can we develop, which was kind of four to five year mine life extension, um uh with a decline development and not needing to uh spend significant capital. So the priority was really minimizing capital expenditure and extending mine life which constrained it to that four to five years. So our prefee will's look at that as well, uh, but we'll also look at some longer dated options as to whether there is potential to extend it even further beyond that, uh which certainly from my site visit there was a lot of optimism from the site team that that was uh possible. Yep. Thanks, Jake. Maybe just quickly on Red Lake, um, you got the approval for the higher throughput um trial. How how long will that um trial last and then and then what are the permitting steps that will follow follow that there? Bob, do you want to take that question? Yep, thanks Al. Um the um the trial is actually we're permitted for uh a a a six to eight week period of basically unlimited throughput through the Campbell Mill. And the reason we want to uh we wanted the trial was det to determine uh how far we could actually push the uh the mill. Um so uh really it's uh it's a short period of time. Uh that will allow us to then uh be able to go and actually seek the the approvals for a permanent lift. At the moment you need a an engineering study and we actually believe that we can actually get um all the data we need um out of this trial to to be able to go and actually seek the the permitting. Thanks Bob. And if I could just sneak one more in, just with Cal, there was a small contribution from um the underground this quarter. I thought we were kind of gonna expect that a little bit a little bit later. So is this is this material a one off or can we kind of expect uh underground to start contributing more and and seeing that ramp up over the next few quarters. Bob Uh we're on track for the the time frame that we've actually spoken about earlier, uh Al. There will be minor uh contributions coming through as we uh develop through uh different zones, uh but it won't be significant in the immediate future. Um but we're on track to to deliver first or as we said. Uh I'm just trying to remember exactly the time frame. I can't remember, sorry. I'd have to go and check it. Jake. No, I d I don't think there was any contribution or material contribution from the underground, it remains on on track and on schedule. No worries. Thank you. Your next question comes from Daniel Morgan from Barren Joey. Please go ahead. Uh hi Jake and Tim. Uh just on Red Lake, um, can you just run through on why FY twenty two guidance is still achievable, albeit at the low end of the ranch. Um it does imply the next two quarters have got a very strong production run rate of over fifty thousand ounces. I guess we're at the end of January, so you should have visibility on that data, but um it just seems a big lift. You know, what what is underpinning that? Do you have you know high grade stopes available? Is it you know, running this trial um of the the plant, you know, does that give you more production? Just you know, how is guidance achievable? Yeah, Dan, thanks. I mean we've specifically said that group guidance is achievable. Um i we're not gonna make the the asset guidance at at Red Lake, um but you know we we're not feeling um that we want to be granular enough to say you know how much we can produce because all these all these steps are in in on in place and are showing improvements um but on a group basis and I think that's what investors should look at. Uh you know, we are confirming that we will make our guns range. Ah right, I must I might have misinterpreted the comment that it was a group comment. Apologies. Um just on red leg, maybe take taking a step back. Could you maybe break out um what are the critical elements that need to be in place for the for the turnaround to occur? Because obviously a lot of these are not in place at at currenther, whet that's equipment, whether that's the um you know, the access to the up the upper Campbell or or or the mill throughputs. Can you just unpick, you know, when these pieces to the turnaround will be in place or expected to be in place and and you know when we can expect that. Sure. Bob, you've just recovered from jet lag from your latest trip there, so over to you. Thanks, Jake, and thanks Dan. As we talked about earlier, the big one to start with was getting the development to open up new areas. But post that we've actually been working on the slope turnaround cycle um and the the time to initial from initial development through to uh filling of a stop so we can uh keep the sequence going for the next um uh for the next stop which comes along right right beside the previous uh filled stopes. So we've been working on uh long hole drill rates, we've been working on pace fill um placement, uh we've been working on reentry times as well as um as stoping and turnover of the actual stopes. So all those together is really is what is enabling the lift last quarter of of our oe tons by I think it's about fifteen percent from the from the previous quarter. So that comes around because we can actually get into the stage quicker a and and more regularly. Um if we actually look at the additional uh mining fronts, what it enables us to do is actually spread the mining fleet out so that interruption and and uh disruption uh from interacting activities is is limited even further. So that allows us to actually turn the actual cycles quicker because we actually don't have the same uh disruption factors. Um a big one for coming quarters is Koshner. Um and last quarter uh, the the um the high speed tram or the uh the uh locomotive that takes the ore from kosher across the reedshaft, that improves significantly from the previous quarter and and that is one of the main things that will allow us because Koshner has got uh a a good turnover cycle uh of its start already. Did I sort of try to answer it? Uh w uh when when is access coming to the to the upper Campbell um for instance? So go ahead go ahead. I was just going to say the upper Campbell, um, so the CYD is actually accessing the upper Campbell, and we're already down into um that area uh with the CYD. First stope ore was always said to be around about twelve months after. So and that still is on on track. Um we will get minor amounts of of development ore earlier, uh the same as at Cal I mean as you as you go through areas you'll you'll in intercept some sort of minor um oil zones. Um but anything from a start will still be within that twelve months from first starting. Jake, did you want to add anything to that? No, other than that you were walking around it uh last week and you um you felt positive about the you know th the outlook over there. I I mean I I suppose the thing that I would add to all this commentary on Red Lake is that each time someone's been there, and particularly Bob, uh who's made several trips, um, you know, there are no red flags with respect to our delivery of this. It's getting uh our operational efficiency uh better down and you know I I still believe this is as I said in my commentary uh this is an amazing commercial opportunity where we've acquired assets that need transformation. Uh it's gonna take some time. Uh we've had a few hiccups in the last six months, but you know there are no red flags with respect to delivery and transforming this operation. tonnages or or the potential ore within that uh Campbell zones. Uh Daniel I I I walked nine, eleven, fourteen and a few other levels this time, and it's uh it's right for the taking, it's just that the access we've got to get there. So that's what's taking the time. Thank you. And the last question would probably be a bit simpler. Um just Mungari. Um just the numbers on page four. Can I just get a confirmation on whether these are equity numbers or or do they have J V production in them? I just want to make sure I'm treating like with like here. Sorry. Yeah. Dan, so the the physicals up up the top will be a hundred percent of what's processed when we're talking about um gold production, silver production, that is our equitable share. So we're we're wanting to show um what the actual mining and processing has been able to do. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Levi Spry from UBS. Please go ahead. Just follow up on Dave and Dan's questions there around Red Lake. Um Bob, do we get the tons and grades for the second half? And and do I assume that the three year two hundred thousand ounces means that we're going for a fifty thousand ounce per quarter run rate in sort of you know twelve months or whatever exactly ten months. I think before Bob answers that I I I'll have a good Happy New Year, Levi. Um y yes is is the i is the answer to your last question. You know, to get to two hundred thousand ounces we need to get to consistently doing a run rate of fifty thousand ounces per quarter. Um we'd prefer not to kind of break down into tons and grade for the next six months because we just feel we want to build confidence ourselves uh on a group guidance basis. We are comfortable, we'll make the the the guidance range, uh but would prefer just to give us give us an another couple of months um to just get comfortable that these that these changes that we're seeing are gonna be repeatable and consistently deliverable. Yep. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Jack. Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead. Is that um is there a reason for that or or should we be expecting a lift in the second half? Yeah, Alex, it it is just basically um timing more than anything. Um we expect that their second half will will lift. I mean the primary focus in the first half was getting the the underground and the IWL um projects continuing and in the second half you'll see some sustaining capital come through. Right, no problem. And uh a quick one at Red Lake, uh just to follow up on what's been asked. So for for the second quarter, can we confirm that there was no grade reconciliation issues? Uh yeah, there there was dilution, but that was improving uh and in the in in the month of December we felt very comfortable that it we'd we'd addressed some of the issues that we were getting in terms of both dilution um a and um and we feel confident that the models are performing to plan. Yeah, okay. Yeah I I was sort of talking about the model that you answered me there. Thanks very much guys. Yeah. Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Friedman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sure. Thanks morning, Jake and Team. Um I don't want to labour the point on Red Lake and you did kind of just touch on it there, Jake, but I I'm just wondering, you know, you you've highlighted on the call and and in the report a number of ways that you know, tons are improving and volumes are improving, you know, we can see mining rates lifting, development rates lifting, but obviously grade keeps falling. Um you've been underperforming the reserve grade for a year now. So I guess does it you know does that mean we'll see an overperformance at some point? Um is there a need to rethink some of the dilution assumptions and and other factors that underpin that reserve grade. You said you you know you're comfortable with the way the model's performing at the moment, but uh I guess there's another year of data on this asset um you know now uh I guess lead lead to any sort of expectations or anything that we should think about at the next um mineral reserve uh sorry, mineral resource or reserve update. Um, you know, any any anything to think about in terms of that? Yeah, thanks, Matt. I mean a good good question again. And Bob and his team have been doing a lot of work on understanding that and and again we came to the we are of the view empirically that the models are performing to plan. But Bob, maybe you can give uh some colour as to some of the issues and then hand over to Glenn to just uh give some guidance on the uh on the MRI. Yeah, no problems. How are you going mate? Um the number that I quoted uh thro when I was speaking, that was the December number. So the number in the report is um i is an average for the quarter of three point nine five and in December it did lift to to four point nine, which is starting to show out some of the uh dilution uh issues that were I spoke about being under control. It's also showing some uh uh improvements in uh drilling accuracy and um and the like within the stopes. So it's actually starting to improve significantly. And that's why what Jake said about we're pretty confident on the on the models. Um we're working on all those things. Are we where we need to be? I still think we've got improvements to be had, so I still think that there's there's further uplifts to come. Um but it is actually all moving in the right direction, so it's pretty pretty pleasing. Um Glenn, did you want to talk uh a comment on the model? Yeah, thanks Bob. Yeah Matt um I think uh just a you know really I guess a bit of a a preview um you know on our MRLR update which we'll uh come out with mid next month. Um as you'll recall when we when we when we did the sort of I guess the evolution update to bring it in as compliance uh you know with with Jork, um we consolidated the models from over a hundred and thirty to nineteen principal models. Um in the last twelve months um we'll we've had new data and mining from six of those models. So so they are the ones that um you know we're going to be revising uh into the MRLI annual update. We're not seeing, you know, really any material movement in in in the resource and that's from a tons and grade perspective, and assuming that the same cutoff grades as we previously have, which is around about three and a half grams per ton on a mineral resource basis. Um we do um you know what w the the new data that we're collecting is really confirming uh some of the geological interpretations. Um there are some small changes, there'll be swings and roundabouts, you know, in areas where we didn't have, you know, as much data support as we would have liked, but that uh that's to be s expected. So I think, you know, all in all, um we're not expecting to see you know any material change. Um sort of you know year over year in terms of the actual geological model and how it informs the the the resource estimate. And I think from sort of looking at this in a great amount of detail, Bob and the uh his technical team and Glenn and the resource. Uh you know, we are confident that yeah we are addressing the mining issues. Um and you with good mining practice uh we should be able to get the grade that is in the models. Got it. Thanks Jake and and thanks for the context, Glenn. Um just secondly uh on Ernest Henry um and obviously congrats to the team on on closing that transaction over Christmas and and the new year. I hope they did manage to get some kind of a holiday. But um just wondering in terms of y you you mentioned that the the copper production during the quarter was a bit lower than than pl sorry, the lower copper production during the quarter was I guess to pl to plan and potentially that's attributable to to lower grades quarter on quarter. Um that asset is still mining above reserve grades for copper in particular. Just wondering when we should be thinking about a a roll off back to reserve grades for that asset. You know, did we see that in the December quarter? Um and then you know, I guess similar to the to the last question, you know, anything to think about in terms of incorporating that um reserve and resource into your next update, you know, now that that's been reported on a hundred percent basis, I believe it's already a JORK standard resource. But yeah, any any movements there to think about um now that it's fully uh evolution ownership. Yeah, thanks Matt. Glenn, do you want to just comment on on the resource? Yeah, sure, Jake. So so on the on the resource, Matt, we yeah, we will be providing an update um mid next month which will incorporate, you know, information uh up until about May last year, which will be the um when when GLECCOR did their their last resource update. So it'll be update reflecting that point in time and it won't incorporate all the drilling information that uh we've collected, you know, between May and December. So that will obviously be rolled into our MROR cycle as we go ahead this 12 month period to to really incorporate all that information in in in addition to the the new drilling that'll be um that that that is in the plan for this year. And Matt, just on the production, it was it was a combination. So in the in the quarter we had a shutdown, uh which was a planned shutdown and it also um a shutdown in the mine. So we we did end up with some lower grades coming through and as as we look at the the rest of the year you do see that the average grade being mined um is is coming back down certainly from where the first quarter was. And the second thing that did impact on on copper in this quarter w were some finalizations of of the previous quarters um uh concentrate sales. So that did have a bit of an impact on the on the copper piece in particular. So it's y you what you'll see on if you look at it uh as a half, um you're going to see that then flow through into the second half as a pretty well a light for light. If once you gross it up to a hundred once you gross it up to a hundred percent, obviously. Right,. got it Thanks Laurie and uh thanks for the comments, Glenn. Thank you. The next question comes from Mitch Ryan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Uh good morning all. Uh thank you very much for the taking out the questions. Um quick question with regards to um Red Lake but but more of a longer term dated question. Just wondering if you could provide an update on Battle North and the acquisition there, specifically around the milling capacity. Part of the the rationale for that was was to potentially bring that that milling capacity online. Um can you give us an update on the permitting processes for that? How much attention's actually being able to be spent on that given the focus on just I guess consolidating um the base level of production in the existing red lake operations. Sure. Bob over to you. The um so the the Battle North um processing plant, um it it's it's there, it's operational if we wanted to start it. We we are uh um replacing uh some parts that um uh need replacing. The the big issue at uh at the uh the Bateman plant is the TSF and we're working through that at the moment. Um for the next sort of uh twelve odd ish months uh our capacity at Red Lake and Campbell uh are going to be enough. So that's what we're we're doing, the permitting and all the work to bring it in on time when we actually need it. From the rest of Battle North, uh, we're still doing work in the underground. Um we're doing some drilling that uh Glenn could talk about. Um so we've done done some grade control drilling over there, uh just to gallery our knowledge on the on your bodies as well. Okay. Thank you, that's it for me. Thanks, Mitch. Your next question comes from Stuart McKinnon from the West Australian. Please go ahead. Oh, good day, Jake and Team. Um I was just intrigued by the um uh the mention in the quarterly about uh up to fifteen percent of your workforce being um effectively knocked out at Red Lake and Cal at various times because of COVID. Obviously uh you know COVID hasn't hasn't been sort of a wash in the community as it has in those those other places, Canada and New South Wales, uh in WA. Are you expecting that you know eventually you're gonna have those have to the same challenges at your WA operations, uh in terms of COVID and managing the workforce as you do at Red Lake and Cal, and how much of more of an impact is that going to be given that you know you're already sort of uh short on workers given the the you know the WA situation with the uh uh you know a labour market shortage just generally in in the resources industry? Yes, J that's that's a good question. Um look we're obviously watching it and monitoring it as clo uh very closely um and you know trying to put in the contingency plans and the learnings which we've got from managing it and we've managed it effectively uh at Red Lake and Cal. Um but you know, unless there is a uh some s uh s someone finds a cure uh for covet, which does not seem to be the case 'cause people who are triple VAC still seem to to be catching the Omnicron uh variants uh in in New South Wales and Canada and around the world, uh then you'd have to think that at some point in time if West Western Australia opens up, uh Omnicron is gonna is gonna spread through Western Australia. So we are gonna do our best to put in contingency plans, but if you couple that with uh a skills shortage, uh it does put uh the whole mining industry in Western Australia at at some risk. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that, Jake. Thank you. Your next question comes from Nick Evans from The Australian. Please go ahead. Um great, sorry about that, just juggling my phone. Um great uh great team. Um just um just to follow up to his question, Jake. It just in terms of New South Wales in particular, uh how are you sort of thinking about the the spread of Tharmicon in New South Wales? Do you think that sort of Cow or or Europe have seen the worst of it? Or what are you expecting this kind of level of absenteeism to um continue for some time. And just in the in terms of WA, I I thought I detected a a sort of a a note of frustration in your voice when you talked about not being able to have um not being able to visit it. I mean do you think that um in terms of dealing with the inevitable splitting WA that the state government should have bitten the bullet and and done it now or or do you think there was um you know there was some benefit to to delaying the reopening in WA. Uh thanks, Nico. I I I'll answer the second question first. Yeah, uh our our preference would have been to have the Western Australian border opened um earlier. Um you know, it just seems like you're in some ways deferring the inevitable uh by keeping it closed, as I said earlier, unless there is a cure which is not on the horizon, um, it is going to be present and it is going to have to be dealt with at some point in time, even if it is deferred. Um, it's not going to be eliminated. Um, it does feel like other places, uh like New South Wales and uh Ontario and the rest of the world is learning how to manage this. Um and certainly at our operations, while it has been a big distraction, uh we have been able to manage through it and uh we are getting more comfortable that we can we can manage it. Um it has um distracted the management teams a lot um but with proper process and um proper protocols, uh it can be managed effectively. Thanks, Jake. Appreciate that next question comes from Jim Pollock from Sabaton Associates. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning everybody. And uh thanks uh Jake. Um I think it was you who said in your introduction that the second half of the financial year uh would be materially better. I was just wondering where we can expect to see uh material uh improvements um in in which operations. Yeah Jim I think thanks. Um uh there are two areas which I'd say you should look out for. Uh the one is Red Lake, uh that we've spoken about at length on this call. Um we expect to see a material improvement in production and reduction in costs over there. Uh and the second one is the acquisition of Ernest Henry uh will be uh fully uh incorporated Right, good. I wasn't going to ask well I thought I'd be a little bit different and not ask any questions on Ernest Henry, but thanks for uh including that answer. Um given the um uh the rain problems you've had in in New South Wales and Queensland. Um just for example, in um at Mount Roughton, what uh what tonnage of uh material, low grade material do you have stockpiled that you can keep the mill running on? I think we have very significant uh low grade stockpiles. That's not the issue. The issue is more uh we want to access the more profitable um lower cost uh ounces in the pit. Right. But uh th there's uh um if you had to depend I'm I'm this is a hypothetical question. If you had to depend a hundred percent on uh stockpile material you have many years ahead of you uh I assume uh many years life left. Yes we do. Right, okay. Um what's the s what's the situation at Cowell? Uh large stockpiles there? Yes, very large uh stockpiles there as well. Um that's what we were treating before the uh we got into the stage eight cutback, which we're now treating all grade material. So Yep, good. Okay, finally, look, uh I've been asked to ask you what what's your best contact uh way of contacting you? Uh Doctor Sandra Close did attempt to uh well did did try to contact you or did contact uh the uh the office uh before Christmas but got no reply. What's what's the best way of uh uh her getting something to you? I think if you go through the the website um we will respond to it. Right. Right. Good. Okay, fine. That's me. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from Anthony Barrage from S and P Global. Please go ahead. Hi Jake. Um just wondering you mentioned early on about uh s some of the headwinds that seem to be fronts of mind. Just wondering for just for the gold sector, you know, um how much are they fronts of mind in in the context of what's going on in the bigger picture? Uh you know, and are you I'm not expecting any crystal balling for the gold sector or anything here, but are you overall more optimistic than not, you know, for the for the uh coming year? Yeah, I'm very optimistic. I mean we've repositioned our portfolio to be yeah, profitable right through the cycle, as we've said. Um we've imp you know if you take our portfolio twelve months on from the beginning of twenty twenty one to the end, uh it's it's materially better. We did the Mungari transaction, we uh the Kandana consolidation, uh we did the um the Ernest Henry transaction and we did the um the Battle North transaction to consolidate Red Lake. So from our perspective, you know, the the strategy remains the same. Uh focus on quality over quantity, return on capital, um and you know benefit. The gold price is over twenty five hundred Australian dollars an ounce. Um I did reflect on the fact when I that when I started in the industry it was three hundred dollars an ounce. So yeah, if we're not happy at twenty five hundred dollars an ounce, um we need to find another uh another sector to operate in. We're we're excited and happy about it. Um yeah, the Fed Reserve meeting this morning told everyone what they knew. Interest rates were gonna go up. Um I didn't see anything that people should have been surprised about in in that meeting. So no I guess my my uh question about uh overall uh overall optimistic um I was more referring to yeah th that that's our macro picture. So you when you refer to the US Fed there, you're obviously saying that's implications are that for the for the gold sector that's obviously looking good for the for the coming year? Crystal Boy, you're coming. Jerome Powell, the the the Fed Reserve Chairman made the point this morning that inflation is way higher than their target and they need to start i raising interest rates and and manage it and and and um reducing their balance sheet. Yeah, that's the question. Yeah, is the Fed gonna be able to do that? Uh and do it in a way that's um th that is uh i i i is not disruptive and yeah, if I if I were someone and I uh uh who who needed uh insurance I'd be buying gold and gold stops like evolution. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Klein for closing remarks. Uh thanks. Uh thanks everyone for participating. Appreciate it. It won't be long before you speak to us again with the release of our interim results in the middle of February. So look forward to updating you then. Um and look forward to being able to hopefully with travel restrictions reducing uh to be able to take you to Ernest Henry, uh take you to Red Lake uh and uh and also visit Cal where there are lots have changes happening because seeing is really believing. So thanks. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disc.onnect",

      "reference" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Evolution Mining December, 2021 quarter results call. All participants are in a listen only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Martin Cummings, general manager of investor relations. Please go ahead. Thank you Darcy. Good morning. And welcome to the Evolution Mining December, 2021 quarterly conference call. As Darcy mentioned, my name's Martin Cummings and I'm the general manager investor relations. This morning on the call we have Jake Klein, our executive chairman, Lawrie Conway, our CFO and finance director, and myself in our group office in Sydney. Bob Fulker, our chief op- chief operating officer and Glen Masterman, our VP discovery and business development are dialing in. It has been in a tumultuous couple of years and as expected, gold's role as a safe haven during those times has been demonstrated. As the pandemic was breaking in early 2020, we saw gold rise from the low of 1500s per ounce to an all time high around 2070 in August that year. We started 2021 with the gold price down from its peak at just under US 1900 per ounce. Economies were surging as they emerged from COVID lockdowns and equity markets were printing new highs. Bitcoin was continuing to generate a lot of interest with some touting it as a new digital gold. An exposure to any metal that ended up in a Tesla was highly sought after. Gold couldn't catch a bid in early 2021 and the sell off was brisk down to 1680 by March. Gold equities would follow, and by the end of September, the GDX index of senior gold companies had fallen about 20% year to date, with the GDXJ junior index even lower, down around 30%. But in the last three months, things have turned. Developing economies are now dealing with soaring inflation with the Federal Reserve now indicating it will need to respond with rate increases soon. The Omicron COVID variance spread quickly, leading some countries to reintroduce or extend lockdowns and restrictions. And recently Russia and Ukraine intention has Europe on high alert. Bitcoin had an incredible journey in 2021, but has now given back most of those gains. Gold's role as a safe haven is returning and we now trade back up around US 1820 per ounce. For Australian gold miners, the Australian gold dollar gold price also went on a wild ride, but we currently sit within 10 to 15% of its all time high. These really are great prices to be selling our product at. And of course, copper had a standout year too rising around 25%. Evolution is well placed to benefit from this with our copper production materially increasing from this month. With that, I'll now hand over to Jake to introduce the December, 2021 quarterly report. Thanks Martin. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Thanks for joining us and happy new year. Despite the industry headwinds, COVID, labor shortages and unseasonal rainfall, our teams did extremely well to manage the impact. As planned and first articulated to you in July, we anticipate the second half of the year to be materially better than the last six months and are on track to deliver our guidance. Given the first half performance at Red Lake, we expect to be in the bottom half of the production range in between the mid and top end of the cost guidance range. Last quarter, our portfolio was significantly improved by securing 100% ownership of the iconic Ernest Henry copper-gold mine. We also concluded the sale of Mount Carlton and Navarre Minerals, and whilst retaining exposure to the future of the operation, the sale allows us to focus in our larger, higher margin assets. We continue to be consistent and diligent in the implementation of our strategy of improving the quality of our portfolio, and being laser focus about putting ourselves into a position where we can generate sector leading returns on the capital we deploy. In our view, this is the holy grail in our industry and is the true measure of a gold company's performance over the long term. I visited Ernest Henry last week and left very confident that in the December quarter we concluded what is likely to prove one of the most transformative deals in Evolution's history. It is an outstanding operation with a great team and terrific geological upside. We look forward to hosting a number of you there for a site visit in due course. The foundations for the transaction were put in place in 2016 when we secured the economic interest in the assets. And since then it built a strong and mutually respectful relationship with Glencore that allowed us to negotiate this deal on a bilateral exclusive basis over the course of, of a few months last year. Our economic interest delivered 79.5 million in cash flow last quarter. And now with 100% of the operation being included from one January, we expect its impact to be even bigger going forward. The cave extension prefeasibility study will be a priority, and with intersections 400 meters below the study area and still open below that, Ernest Henry has a long and very exciting future. Carl performed extremely well and managed to deliver to plan in spite of unprecedented rainfall and, and COVID interruptions. The underground project which will grow Carl's production to 350,000 ounces per annum remains on schedule and budget. I was also fortunate to be able to visit Red Lake in November last year. Due to COVID travel restrictions, this was my first visit since we took ownership of the asset in April, 2020. Red Lake is one of the best commercial opportunities I've seen in the gold sector in my career. For the combined purchase price of $650 million being Red Lake and Battle North, we have secured a district scale tenem- tenement position with 11 million ounce of resource and significant exploration upside, seven kilometers of prospective strike with associated mining infrastructure, three mills and $700 million of Canadian tax losses. In time, this asset will be transformed into plus 350,000 ounce a year low cost producer. This is our values created in our sector. As you will hear from Bob, who has just returned from his third visit in the last five months, progress is being made. Last quarter we consistently achieved over 1200 meters of development each month. And as a result of this and other improvements, we have confidence of a material and sustainable improvement to production in the next two quarters. We expect this higher production to drive the cost per ounce lower, and I'm looking forward to visiting the operation again with Lawrie in the next few weeks. Frustratingly Mungari remains the only asset in our portfolio that we cannot, cannot currently visit. We are fortunate to have a good team in Western Australia who've led the Kundana integration, which has gone well. And we are growing increasingly confident about the future and the potential of this operation. Mt. Rawdon was impacted by heavy rainfall and was forced to process low, the low grade stock power material. Strategically we continue to assess the potential of Mt. Rawdon to be converted into pumped hydro generator, which could be a significant contributor of renewable energy to the Southeast Queensland grid at the end of its mine life. This last quarter, the highlights for the discovery team were good intersections at Q and Western Australia, and also more intriguing and exciting intersections at Red Lake where there is plenty of open space and interesting geology to discover another high grade zone. Glen and his team are also plotting and planning the next phase of drilling at Earnest Henry. Whilst we are managing industry headwinds, we should not ignore the significant commodity price tailwinds. A gold price of over A$ 2,500 and a copper price, which going forward will represent around 20% of our revenue of over A$ 13,500 per ton. Evolution is well positioned to benefit from this. I'll now hand over to Bob to provide some more detail on the operational performance. Thanks, Jake, and, uh, good morning everyone. The December quarter saw our <inaudible> stabilize at 9.4. The highlight being a 35% reduction in the 12 month moving average at Mungari. The December quarter goal production is the first reported without Mount Carlton's contribution. The quarter's goal production was 148,000 ounces with a 5% improvement in the oil in sustaining cost to $1,347 an ounce. Despite the challenges faced with above average rainfall and COVID, Cowal had a strong quarter delivering 60,000 ounces at an all in sustaining cost of $998 an ounce. And an operating mine cashflow pre-capital of 80.6 million. Capital investment ramped up at Cowal with 60 million spent on major projects this quarter. This included 24 million on the IWL and 33.5 million on the underground development. Underground development rates will ramp up in the March quarter with a second jumbo commencing in December. And the selection of the primary mining contractor is on track for the March quarter. The project remains on budget and on schedule. The <inaudible> stage two deposition has run smoothly throughout the quarter. Ernest Henry produced 21,000 ounces of gold and 4. 1000 ounces of copper at an all in sustaining cost of a- $882 an ounce. The high IISC compared to the September quarter is primary driven, primarily driven by lower copper production due to a lower mining planned, uh, lower planned mining tons. The net mine cash remains strong at 79.5 million, another significant contribution to the portfolio. I'm pleased to say this will be the last quarter reporting Ernest Henry as an economic interest. Integration activities are well underway and I'm excited to have the Ernest Henry team as part of the Evolution family. The prefeasibility study for the mining extension below the 1125 RL has commenced and will incorporate the recent drilling results. Indicating mineralization extends further than assumed in the conce- concept study. Completion of the study is expected in H1 FY23. Moving on to Red Lake, over the past five months I've been on site three times. Each time I've seen improvement in step change in performance and devel- uh, and delivering. Although still work in progress, pleasingly, many key metrics are moving in the right direction. Red Lake produced 20,000 ounces for the quarter. And although the all in sustaining cost is not where we need it to be, the operating mine cash flow for the quarter was a positive. And with, and we've spent 13.9 million in sustaining capital and 36.9 million on major capital for future production. For the past couple of quarters, I've been talking about development. Pleasingly during the December quarter, each month was above our long, our, our long term transformation goal of 1200 meters per month. The December quarter was 21% higher than the September quarter. I expect this to continue allowing additional mining fronts to be opened. Campbell Mill continues to do, achieve new records and approval has been granted to lift the daily throughput restriction of 2000 tons per day for a limited trial in the second half of the financial year to support the Campbell Mill expansion. While still not where we want them to be, there's been significant improvements through the quarter. <inaudible> cycle time has improved by 25%. <inaudible> idle time has improved by 60%. Time to drill per <inaudible> has improved by 27%, and slot drilling has halved with a V30 implementation. <inaudible> extraction quality focused has delivered a 19% improvement in <inaudible> recovery, a 3% reduction in dilution and a 15% increase <inaudible> quarter and quarter. And in December, <inaudible> grade lifted to 4.9 grams per ton. Looking forward to H2, we are expecting, expecting to see a continually improvement in delivery from the underground and the two mills operating. Notable improvements for the second half of the year, our tons assessed will increase with the Red L- Red Lake mill running and the Campbell Mill <inaudible> extension. Grade mine, mind is lifting as dilution reduces and plans for early ore from the CYD development continue. Increased tons from <inaudible>. The transfer <inaudible> locomotion, the locomotives performance has improved by 43% last quarter, and replacement locomotives will be commissioned this quarter further reducing downtime. And increased number of mining ho- horizons in continuing the improvement in stoke design and execution to further enhance our all deliveries and quality. Mungari is moving forward post integration. Further quarter, they produced 34,000 ounces of gold at an all in sustaining cost of $1,829 an ounce, and generate an operating mine cashflow precapital of 20.7 million. All grade processed increased to 34% over the last quarter, as a proportion of underground ore and the feed increased from 54% to 67%. Workforce integration is ongoing with a focus on establishing a one team approach. The sharing of resources across the field has commenced and enabling better deployment of equipment and resources to priority areas, which has been a, been critical as a site navigates high vacancy rates and COVID related impacts. Mt. Rawdon produced 12,400 ounces at an only sustaining cost of $1,842 an ounce, and operating mice cash precapital of 11.9 million. As previously mentioned, weather significantly impacted access to the pit resulting in reduced all movements. As a result stock pile feed increased directly affecting gold grade and production. In summary, some great improvements from Red- Red Lake and Mungari throughout the quarter. The Cowal underground project continues to hit milestones and the official ownership of Ernest Henry mine has added additional opportunity for the portfolio. Thank you for your time and I'll hand over to Glen. Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Firstly, at our Q joint venture in Western Australia, we've advised our partner, Musgrave Minerals that we will be taking full management and operatorship at the project which occurred on January 1st of this year. Recent results from diamond drilling at the West Island prospect outlined on page 15 of this morning's report, importantly confirm the potential for high grade mineralization within individual loads. Drilling has also identified multiple new load structures in the favorable diorite host in various locations along strike. The geometric relationships between structures and diorite employee individual loads may be limited by their potential strike length that remain open at depth. The airport drilling program has been very important in further delineating the favorable diorite host and associated golden- golden nomism along strike from the original West Island drilling. The res- the results have unlocked new areas with the necessary geological ingredients. The mineralization to occur up to five kilometers from West Island. One of the challenges with all of our drilling programs is long delays waiting to receive assay result, results in time to inform where to drill next. This is an industry wide issue and is holding back the ability to accelerate drilling programs in the ways we would like to. At Q we are still waiting on results from five diamond holes and over 70 air core holes, which restricts our ability to sensibly add additional drilling resources. At Red Lake two deep holes were completed as wide space step outs from the original intercept reported last quarter on the ore zone extension. One of the holes intersected high grade mineralization 200 meters away from the first, from the first hole, with the other hole drilling through the structure. However, it did not return significant mineralization. The results reported on page 12 are encouraging because they'll unlock large area of real estate that has not been previously drilled along the extension of the ore zone structure. Follow up drilling is currently stepping off the high grade intercept in hole 69 to expand the potential scale of minimization in this area. At Mungari, drilling underground at Kundana and East Kundana continuous concentration on small resource extensions and classification upgrades on future mining areas adjacent to existing development. Step out drilling into the foot wall of the K2 structure from the underground at Hornet has returned further promising intercepts of stacked load style mineralization at <inaudible>. Follow up drilling is underway to understand the significance to eliminated vein in hole 2130 reported on page 14 of this morning's report. The geology is similar to what would be expected on the main cases structure at <inaudible>, which is where the priority follow up drilling. At Ernest Henry, we have assessed H2 drilling priorities, which will be focused on developing all body knowledge for the PFS along with de-risking areas of the resource that require additional data support before production is scheduled. As Bob and Jake mentioned earlier, strong copper gold mineralization has been intersected at the 480 meter RL and remains open down plunge. With that I'll hand over the Lawrie. Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide a brief update on the financial performance for the quarter as outlined on pages nine and 10 of the report. The group, we produced 148,000 ounces at an all in sustaining cost of 1347 per ounce. This aligns without guidance where we said the production would increase over the year and the all in sustaining costs would trend down from around 1450 per ounce in the first quarter. The IISC was approximately 5% lower than the September quarter. Our focus on portfolio quality is evident in that on a light for light basis, the divestment of Mount Carlton operation reduced our all in sustaining cost by $28 per ounce this quarter. As our production in cost profile changes in the second half, the cost benefit from this divestment will improve further. Group production and cost guidance remain unchanged at 670 to 725,000 ounces at an all in sustaining cost of 1135 to 1195 per ounce. With the performance of Red Lake in the first half, we to be at the bottom end of the production range and between in the top half of the cost guidance range. In terms of cashflow, we were fairly well in line with plan, excluding the underperformance at Red Lake. We generated 203 million of operating cash flow, which is up 4.6% and 13% excluding Mount Carlton. On a per ounce basis, our operating cash flow was up 10% quarter on quarter. This was against a flat goal price and lower copper revenue where the higher copper price was offset by planned lower copper volumes at Ernest Henry. Net mine cash flow was 53 million with our capital programs remaining on plan. We invested around 34 million in sustaining capital, where major project investment increased to 114 million as projects in Cowal and at Cowal and Red Lake progressed. Group capital guidance remains unchanged at 150 to 175 million for sustaining, and 440 to 505 million for major projects. We'll see an immediate benefit of the acquisition of 100% of Ernest Henry, where IISC will reduce materially in the second half of the year. More importantly though, our cashflow will be increasing. Based on our guidance and depending on the copper price achieved in the second half, we expect to realize an additional 80 to 130 million of net mine cashflow at Ernest Henry. This will be taken into consideration when determining our interim dividend. As previously announced during the quarter, we successfully priced the US 200 million US private placement for nine years at very attractive pricing to partially fund the Ernest Henry acquisition. This will be drawn down next month. We ended December with 1.15 billion of cash and net debt of 450 million. Now our <inaudible> is around 12.6% prior to the payment for Ernest Henry in early January. We are on track to be below the 29% projector at time of announcing the acquisition, and we expect to quickly be back within our targeted gearing levels and maintain a very wrong balance sheet. I look forward to updating you next month on the FY22 interim financial results. Thank you for your time this morning. And Darcy, please open the line for questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. Your first question comes from David Radcliffe from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. Hi. Good, good morning, Jake team. So, uh, my question's on Red Lake. The, the commentary around mining rates does seem like, you know, more optimistic today, which is great, uh, especially with respect to, I guess, the mine efficiencies and dilution and, and opening up more mining freights up front. So just trying to think how we should think about, you know, the high development rates converting it to higher mine tons over sort of this year. And if you could maybe provide some sort of quantum how that comes through over the next c- couple of quarters. Uh, and then on grade, how we should sort of think about those numbers over the year. Obviously there's gonna be the sweetener from Campbell, but, you know, when do we from the, the operations today, how do we move closer to that reserve greater six, given that currently <inaudible>? Thanks, David. Uh, those are good questions. Um, I mean, I think we, you know, we are going through a transformation, you know, we've called it a three to five year transformation at Red Lake. Uh, the six months have taught us a lot about the operation. Uh, we've focused on the development and we've, we've specifically taken the decision to, I suppose, sacrifice production over development and getting ready and setting the tra- the transformation up. And we now feel that we've kind of bottomed and we're at a point where you really gonna see improvements in that. Um, so the development rates are up. Uh, the improvements in, in mining are, are getting better. Uh, as Bob highlighted and he can talk further to it, you know, dilution has been reduced. Uh, we are comfortable that the models are performing. Um, we need to open up some of these higher grade areas, which are gonna be happening over the next few months. Um, so it's a, it's a journey, uh, we're on the right path, um, and you are gonna see, uh, material improvements to production and lowering of costs, uh, in the next quarter and following quarters. Bob, do you wanna add to that? Yeah. Thanks, uh, Jake. Uh, David, as Jake said, um, the expectation is that as we get the development in, uh, to the new areas and it takes a long time, uh, to, to go out and to open up new areas, then the mining front will open up, which will help stabilize and increase the, the tonnages. We've started to see an increase in tonnages last quarter through the quarter. Um, although it's not a- as high as we need it yet, but it's still it's growing. Um, a- a- and areas like, uh, aviation and the like, uh, they do take a bit of time to, to set up. So, uh, I would expect that, um, over the next couple of quarters, you'll start to see those tonnages come in. Uh, as, uh, gr- Jake said also on the grade, um, you know, we are getting a lot better, um, with the reconciliations of, of, um, dilution a- and, um, and the like, as I mentioned, all the, all the numbers. Um, I, I expect that over coming quarters we'll see, um, that continue to, to improve. Glen, did you wanna comment on the models specifically? Sure, Bob. I, I think, um, you know, one of the things that we are starting to see, David is that, um, particularly with our reconciliations, so our, our <inaudible> control and our dome two or reserve, um, we're starting to see an upward tick, um, you know, particularly on the grade front as, as we improve, particularly some of the, you know, the mining related factors as Bob has just described, dilution recovery, um, and, and we've improved our grade control system. So we, we are starting to see that upward tick in the grade, uh, and particularly on a three month moving average, it's, uh, it's starting to trend into the direction where we need it to be. So we, we have confidence, uh, that the models, um, you know, are performing, uh, to plan and, and we're just aligning that with the, the way we are mining, and, and, um, you know, we're confident that we'll start to see that where it needs to be over next coming quarters. I just, uh, conclude, um, that David with a, a comment around the fact that we've owned this asset for 21 months. Um, it's only been in the last five months that we've been able to visit the, the operation. Uh, but when we bought the asset in April, 2019, we said, our three year goal was to get to a run rate of 200,000 ounces of gold, uh, and then a longer term five year, um, horizon of 350,000 ounces a year. And, uh, we are, uh, committed to delivering that, uh, on both 36 month and 60 month targets. Great. Thanks very much, guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Your next question comes from Earl Harvey from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yeah. Morning Jake and team. Just, um, couple from me. Just with, um, Ernest Henry and, and the study. So we've got about 18 months for the PFS. Um, just wondering if, if this was going to, um, take on much of the, the work that Glencore did or if it'll be kind of a complete recut incorporating that those further depth extensions. And I think Glen, you mentioned it was going down to 480 meters, um, and still open beyond. So where potentially could you, um, would you kind of draw the line on, on those depth extensions and, and, and where this study will kind of finish up? Yes. So Earl, the, the, just to clarify the study will be, um, delivered in the second half of this calendar year. So first half of FY23. So we are kind of, uh, say nine months away to, from delivery of that. Um, it will build on, um, the concept study, which, uh, was completed by Glencore. Um, I suppose one of the things which we found intriguing as we've looked at the concept study, um, is that it was determined really on the basis of, um, minimizing the capital expenditure, which meant that the depth extent of the concept study went down to, as far as the decline could go and you could truck material up. Uh, so it wasn't constrained or limit, uh, determined by geology. It was more determined by, you know, how far can we develop, how deep can we develop, which was kind of four to five year mine life extension, um, uh, with a decline development and not needing to, uh, spend significant capital. So the priority was really minimizing capital expenditure and extending mine life, um, by which, which constrained it to that 45 years. So our pre fees will look at that as well. Uh, but it will also some longer date options as to whether there is potential to extend it even further beyond that, uh, which certainly from my site visit, there was a lot of optimism from the site team that, that was, uh, possible. Yep. Th- thanks, Jake. Um, maybe just quickly on Red Lake, um, you got the approval for the higher throughput, um, trial. How, how long will that, um, trial last and then, and then what are the permitting steps that will follow, follow that there? Bob, do you wanna take that question? Yep. Thanks Earl. Um, the, um, the trial is actually we've permitted for, uh, a, a, a six to eight week period of basically unlimited throughput through the Campbell Mill. And the reason we wanna, uh, we wanted the trial was to, to determine, uh, how far we could actually push the, uh, the mill. Um, so, uh, really it's a, it's a short period of time, uh, that will allow us to then, uh, be able to go and actually seek the, the approvals for a permanent lift. Um, at the moment you need a, an engineering study and we actually believe that we can actually get, um, all the data we need, um, out of this trial to, to be able to go and actually seek the, the permitting. Thanks, Bob. And if I could just sneak one more in just with Cowal, there was a small contribution from, um, the underground this quarter. I thought we were kind of gonna expect that a little bit, a little bit later. So is this, is this material a one off, or can we kind of expect, uh, underground to start contributing more and, and seeing that ramp up over the next few quarters? Bob. <inaudible>. We're on track for the, the timeframe that we've actually spoken about earlier, uh, Earl. There will be minor, uh, contributions coming through as we, uh, develop through, uh, different zones. Uh, but it won't be significant in the imme- immediate future. Uh, but we're on track to, to deliver first order, as we said. Uh, I'm just trying to remember exactly the timeframe. I can't remember. Sorry. I'd have to go and check it. Jake. No, I don't, I don't think there was any contribution or material contribution from the underground. It remains on, on track and on schedule. Yeah, no worries. Thanks. Thanks, Jake and Bob. Cheers. Thank you. Your next question comes from Daniel Morgan from Barrenjoey. Please go ahead. Uh, hi, Jake and team. Uh, just on Red Lake. Um, can you just run through on why FY22 guidance is still achievable, albeit at the low end of the ranch? Um, it does imply the next two quarters have got a very strong production run rate of over 50,000 ounces. I guess we're at the end of January, so you should have visibility on that data. But, um, it just seems a big lift. You know, what, what is underpinning that do you have, you know, high grade stokes available? Is it, you know, running this trial, um, of the, the plant, you know, does that give you more production? Just, you know, how is guidance achievable? Yeah, Dan, thanks. I mean, we've specifically said that group guidance is achievable. Um, we're not gonna make the, the asset guidance at, at Red Lake. Um, but you know, we, we are not feeling, um, that we wanna be granular enough to say, you know, how much we can produce, because all these, all these steps are in, in, on, in place and are showing improvements, um, but on a group basis. And I think that's what investors should look at. Uh, you know, we are confirming that we will make our guidance range. All right. I must, I might have misinterpreted the comment that it was a group comment. Apologies. Um, just on Red Lake, maybe take- taking a step back. Could you maybe break out, um, what are the critical elements that need to be in place for the, for the turnaround to occur? 'Cause obviously a lot of these are not in place at, at current, whether that's the equipment, whether that's the, um, you know, the access to the, the upper Campbell or, or, or the mill through reports. Can you just unpick, you know, when these pieces to the turnaround will be in place or expected to be in place and, and you know, when we can expect that? Sure. Bob you've just recovered from jet lag from your latest trip there. So over to you. Thanks, Jake and thanks Dan. um, uh, as we talked about earlier, the big one to start with was getting the development to open up new areas. Um, but post that we've actually been working on, uh, the slope turnaround cycle, um, a- and the, the time to initial, from initial development through to, uh, filling of <inaudible> so we can keep the sequence going for the next, um, uh, for the next scope, which comes along right, right beside the previous, uh, field stokes. So we've been working on, uh, long haul drill rates. We've been working on pace fill, um, placement. Uh, we've been working on reentry times as well as, um, uh, stooping and turnover of the actual stokes. So all those together is really, is what is enabling the lift last quarter o- of our <inaudible> by, I think it's about 15% from the, from the previous quarter. So that comes around because we can actually get into the stokes quicker a- a- and, and more regularly. Um, i, if we actually look at the additional, uh, mining fronts, what it enables us to do is actually spread the mining fleet out. So that interruption a- and, uh, the disruption, uh, from interacting activities, i- is limited even further. So that allows us to actually turn the actual cycles quicker because we actually don't have the same, uh, disruption factors. Um, a big one for coming quarters is <inaudible>. Uh, and last quarter, uh, the, the, um, the high spring trim or the, uh, the, uh, locomotive that takes the ore from <inaudible> across the <inaudible>, that improves significantly from the previous quarter. And, and that is one of the main things that allow us because <inaudible> has got, uh, a, a good turnover cycle o- of its types already. Did I sort of try to answer it? Oh, uh, when, when is access coming to the, to the upper Campbell, um, for instance? So- Bob. <inaudible>… Sorry. Go, go ahead. I, I was just gonna say the upper Campbell, um, so the CYD is actually accessing the upper Campbell and, and we are already down into, um, that area, uh, with the CYD. First ore was always said to be around about 12 months after. So, a- and that still is on, on track. Um, we will get minor amounts of, of development or earlier, uh, the same as at Cowal. I mean, as you, as you go through areas, you'll, you'll intercept some sort of minor, um, ore zones, um, but anything from the start will still be within that 12 months from first starting. Jake, do you wanna add anything to that? No. Other than that, you were walking around at, uh, last week and you, um, you felt positive about the, you know, the outlooks over there. I, I mean, I suppose the thing that I would add to all this commentary on Red Lake is that each time someone's been there and particularly Bob, uh, is made several trips, um, you know, there are no red flags with respect to our delivery of this. It's getting, uh, our operational efficiency, uh, bettered down. And, you know, I, I still believe this is, as I said in my commentary, uh, this is an amazing commercial opportunity where we've acquired assets that need transformation. Uh, it's gonna take some time. Uh, we've had a few hiccups in the last six months, but, you know, there are no red flags with respect to delivery and transforming this operation. Uh, I guess, Jake, on that comment about the, the ore tonnages or, or the potential ore within that, uh, Campbell zones. Uh, Daniel, I, I walked nine, 11, 14, and a few other levels this time. And it's, and it's right for the taking. It's just this the access we gotta get there. So that's what's taken the time. Thank you. And last question is probably be a bit simpler. Um, just Mungari. Um, just the numbers on page four. Can I just get a confirmation on whether these are equity numbers or, or do they have JV production in them? I just wanna make sure I'm treating like with like here. Sorry. Yeah. Dan so the, the physicals up, up the top will be 100% of what's processed when we're talking about, um, gold production, silver production that is our equitable share. So we, we're wanting to show, um, what the actual mining and processing has been able to do. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Levi Spry from UBS. Please go ahead. Uh, yeah. Good day. Uh, happy new year. Thank, thanks, thanks for the call. Um, c- can, can I just follow up on Dave and Dan's questions there around Red Lake. Um, Bob, can we get the tons and grades for the second half? And, and do I assume that the three year, 200,000 ounces means that we're going for a 50,000 ounce per quarter run rate into the, you know, 12 months or whatever expect to be <inaudible>? I think before Bob answers that, I, I'll have a go. Happy new year, Levi. Um, yes. Is, is the, i- is the answer to your last question. You know, to get to 200,000 ounces, we need to get to consistently doing a run rate of 50,000 ounces per quarter. Um, we'd prefer not to kind of break down into tons and grades for the next six months, because we just feel we will wanna build confidence ourselves. Uh, on a group guidance basis, we are comfortable we'll make the, the, the guidance range, uh, but we'd prefer just to give us, give us another, you know, couple of months, um, to just get comfortable that these, that these changes that we're seeing are gonna be repeatable and consistently deliverable. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Thanks Jake. Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead. Uh, hi Jake team. Um, first a, a quick one at Cowal. It seems like sustaining CapEx is maybe running a bit low on an annualized basis. Is that, um, is there a reason for that or, or should we be expecting a lift in second half? Lawrie. Yeah, Alex, it is just basically, um, timing more than anything. Um, we expect that their second half will, will lift. I mean, the primary focus in the first half was getting the, the underground and the IWL, um, projects continuing. And in the second half, you'll see some sustaining capital come through. All right. No problem. And, uh, a quick one at Red Lake, uh, just to follow up on what's been asked. So for, for the second quarter, can we confirm that there was no grade reconciliation issued? Uh, yeah, there, there was dilution, but that was improving. Uh, and in the, in, in the months of December, we felt very comfortable that it we'd, we'd addressed some of the issues that we were getting in terms of both dilution, um, a and, um, and we feel confident that the models are performing to plan. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I, I was sort of talking about the model but you've answered me there. Thanks very much, guys. Yeah. Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Friedman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sure. Thanks. Morning, Jake and team. Um, I don't wanna labor the point on Red Lake and you did kind of just touch on it there, Jake, but I, I'm just, just wondering, you know, you, you've highlighted on the call and, and in the report a number of ways, but you know, tons are improving and volumes are improving. You know, we can see mining rates lifting, development rates lifting. But obviously grade keeps falling. Um, you've been underperforming the reserve grade for a year now. So I guess, does it, you know, does that mean we'll see an over performance at some point? Um, is there a need to rethink some of the dilution assumptions and other factors that underpin that reserve grade? You said, you, you know, you're comfortable with the way the model was performing at the moment. But, uh, I guess there's another year of data on this asset, um, you know, now, uh, I guess le- lead to any sort of expectations or anything that we should think about at the next, um, mineral reserves, uh… Sorry. Mineral resource or reserve update. Um, you know, any, any, anything to think about in terms of that? Yeah. Thanks Matt. I mean, a good, good question again. And Bob and his team have been doing a lot of work on understanding that. And, and again, we came to the, we are of the view and empirically that the models are performing to plan. But Bob, maybe you can give, uh, some color as to some of the issues and then hand over to Glen to just, uh, give some guidance on the, o- on the <inaudible>. Yeah, no problems. How you doing, Matt? Um, the number that I quoted, uh, when I was speaking, that was the December number. So the number in the report is, um, i- is an average for the quarter of 3.95. And in December it did lift to, to 4.9, which is starting to show out some of the, uh, dilution, uh, issues that were, I spoke about being under control. It's also showing some, uh, improvements in, uh, drilling accuracy and, um, and the like within the scope. So it's actually starting to improve significantly. And that's why, what Jake said about, we're pretty confident on the, on the models. Um, we're working on all those things. Are we where we need to be? I still think we've got improvements to be had. So I still think that there's, there's further uplifts to come. Um, but it is actually all moving in the right direction. So it's pretty, pretty pleasing. Um, Glen, did you wanna talk, uh, comment on the model? Yeah. Thanks Bob. Yeah, Matt, um, I think, uh, just a, you know, really, I guess a bit of a, a preview, um, you know, on our MRR update, which will, uh, come out with mid next month. Um, as you'll recall, when we, when we, when we did the sort of, I guess, the Evolution update to bring it in as compliance, uh, you know, with, with jock, um, we consolidated the models from over 130 to 19 principal models. Um, in the last 12 months, um, we'll, we've had new data and mining from six of those models. So, so they are the ones that, um, you know, we are going to be revising, you know, into the MRR annual update. We're not seeing, you know, really any material movement in, in, in the resource and that's from a tons and grade perspective. Um, and, and assuming that the same cutoff grades as we previously have, which is around about three and a half grams per ton, uh, on, you know, on a minimal resource basis. Um, we do, um, you know, what the, the new data that we're collecting is really confirming, uh, some of the geological interpretations. Um, there are some small changes. There'll be swings and roundabouts, you know, in areas where we didn't have, you know, as much data support as we would've liked, but that, uh, that's to be expected. So I think, you know, all in all, um, we're not expecting to see, you know, any material change, um, um, sort of, you know, year over year in terms of the actual geological model and how it informs the, the, the resource estimate. And I think from sort of looking at this in a great amount of detail, Bob, and the, uh, his technical team and Glen and the resource, uh, you know, we are confident that, you know, we are addressing the mining issues, um, and, you know, with good mining practice, uh, we should be able to get the grade that is in the models. Got it. Thanks, Jake. And, and thanks for the context, Glen. Um, just secondly, uh, on Ernest Henry, um, and obviously congrats with the team on, on closing that transaction over Christmas and, and the new year. I hope they did manage to get some kind of a holiday. But, um, just wondering in terms of, you mentioned that the, the copper production during the quarter was a bit lower than, than p- Sorry. The lower copper production during the quarter was I guess, to, to plan, uh, and potentially that's attributable to, to lower grades quarter on quarter. Um, that asset is still mining above reserve grades for copper in particular. Just wondering when we should be thinking about, uh, a roll off back to reserve grades for that asset? You know, did we see that in the December quarter? Um, and then, you know, I guess similar to the, to the last question, you know, anything to think about in terms of incorporating that, um, reserve and resource into your next update, you know, now that that's being reported on 100% basis? I believe it's already a jock standard resource. But yeah, any, any movements there to think about, um, now that it's fully, uh, Evolution ownership? Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Glen, do you wanna just comment on, on the resource? Yeah sure, Jake. So, so on the, on the resource, Matt, we, yeah, we will be providing an update, um, mid next month, which we'll incorporate, you know, information, uh, up until about May last year, which will be the, um, when, when Glencore did their, their last resource updates. So the update reflecting that point in time and it won't incorporate all the drilling information that, uh, we've collected, you know, between May and December. Um, so that will obviously be rolled in to our MRR cycle as we go ahead, uh, you know, this 12 month period, uh, to, to really incorporate all that information in, in addition to the, the new drilling that'll be, um, that, that, that is in the plan for this year. And Matt, just on the production, it was, it was a combination. So in the, in the quarter we had a shutdown, uh, which was a planned shutdown, and it also, um, a shutdown in the mine. So we, we did end up with some lower grades coming through. And as, as we look at the, the rest of the year, you do see that the average grade being mined, um, is, is coming back down, certainly from where first quarter was. And the second thing that did impact on, on copper in this quarter were, were some finalizations of, of the previous quarters, um, uh, concentrate sales. So that did have a bit of an impact on, on the copper piece, in particular. So it's you, what, you'll see if you look at it, uh, as a half, um, you're going to see that then flow through into the second half as a pretty well a like for l if once you <crosstalk>, once you grace it up to 100% obviously. Right. Got it. Thanks, Lawrie. And, uh, thanks for the comments, Glen. Thank you. So next question comes from Mitch Ryan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Uh, good morning all. Uh, thank you very much for taking out the questions. Um, quick question with regards to, um, Red Lake, but, but more of a longer term dated question. <inaudible> provide an update on Battle North and, and the acquisition there specifically around the milling capacity. Um, part of the, the rationale for that was, was to potentially bring that, that milling capacity online. Um, can you give us an update on the permitting processes for that, how much <inaudible> actually being able to be spent on that given the focus on just, I guess, consolidating, um, the base level of production in the existing Red Lake operations? Sure. Uh, Bob over you. Yeah. Thanks. The, um, so the, the Battle North, um, processing plant, um, it's, it's there, it's operational if we wanted to start it. We, we are, um, replacing, uh, some parts that, um, uh, need replacing. The- the big issue at, uh, at the, uh, the Bateman plant in the TSF and we're working through that at the moment. Um, for the next sort of, uh, 12 odd ish months, uh, our capacity at Red Lake in Campbell, uh, are going to be enough. So that's what we're, we are doing the permit and all the work to bring it in on time, um, when we actually need it. Um, from the rest of Battle North, uh, we're still doing work in the underground. Um, we are doing some drilling that, uh, Glen will talk about. Um, so we've done, done some grade control drilling over there, uh, just to grow our knowledge on the, on <inaudible> as well. Okay. Thank you. That's it for me. Thanks, Mitch. Thank you. Your next question comes from Stuart McKinnon from The West Australian. Please go ahead. Oh, good day, Jake and team. Um, I was just intrigued by the, um, uh, the mention in the quarterly about, uh, up to 15% of your workforce being, um, quite effectively knocked out at Red Lake a- a- and Cowal at various times because of COVID. Um, you know, obviously, uh, you know, COVID hasn't, hasn't been sort of a wash in the community as it has in those, those other places, Canada and New South Wales. Uh, in WA, are you expecting that, you know, eventually you're gonna have those <inaudible> the same challenges at your WA operations, uh, in terms of COVID and managing the workforce as you do at Red Lake and Cowal? And how much and more of an impact is that gonna be given that, you know, you're already sort of, uh, short on workers given the, the, you know, the WA situation with the, you know, a labor market shortage just generally in, in the resources industry? Yes, Stuart, that's, that's a good question. Um, look, we're obviously watching it and monitoring it as, uh, very closely, um, and, you know, trying to put in the contingency plans and the learnings which we've got from managing it, and we've managed it effectively a- at Red Lake and Cowal. Um, but, you know, unless there is, uh, some, someone finds a cure, uh, for COVID, which does not seem to be the case, because people who are triple vacs still seem to, to be catching the omicron, uh, variants, uh, in, in New South Wales and Canada and around the world. Uh, then you'd have to think that at some point in time, if West, Western Australia opens up, uh, omicron is gonna, i- is gonna spread through Western Australia. So we are gonna do our best to put in contingency plans, but if you couple that with, uh, a skill shortage, uh, it does put, uh, the whole mining industry in Western Australia at, at some risk. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that, Jake. Thank you. Your next question comes from Nick Evans from The Australian. Please go ahead. Um, <inaudible>. I'm just juggling my phone. Um, good day, good day team. Um, just, um, just to follow up Stuart's question, Jake. Just in terms of New South Wales in particular, how are you sort of thinking about the, the spread of omicron in New South Wales? Do you think that sort of Cowal or your operation there have seen the worst of it? Or what are you expecting this kind of level of absenteeism to, um, continue for some time? And just in, in terms of WA, I, I thought I detected a, sort of a, a note of frustration in your voice when you talked about not being able to have, um, not being able to visit it. I mean, do you think that, um, in terms of dealing with the inevitable split in WA that the state government should have bitten the bullet and, and done it now, or, or do you think there was, um, you know, there was some benefit to, to delaying the reopening in WA? Uh, thanks, Nick. I'll, I'll, I'll answer the second question first. Yeah, uh, our, our preference would've been to have the Western Australian border opened, um, earlier. Um, you know, it just seems like you're in some ways deferring the inevitable, uh, by keeping it closed, as I said earlier, unless there is a cure, which is not on the horizon. Um, it is gonna be present and it is gonna have to be dealt with at some point in time, even if it is deferred, um, it's not gonna be eliminated. Um, it does feel like other places, uh, like New South Wales and, uh, Ontario and the rest of the world is learning how to manage this. Um, and certainly at our operations while it has been a big distraction, uh, we have been able to manage through it and, uh, we are getting more comfortable that we can, we can manage it. Um, it has, um, distracted the management teams a lot, um, but with proper process and, um, proper protocols, uh, it can be managed effectively. Thanks, Jake. Appreciate that. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Polik from <inaudible> Associates. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning, everybody. And, uh, thanks, uh, Jake. Um, I think it was you who said in your introduction that the second half of the financial year, uh, would be materially better. I was just wondering where we can expect to see, uh, material, uh, improvements, um, in, in which operations? Yeah, Jim, I think thanks. Um, uh, there are two areas which I'd say you should look out for. Uh, the one is Red Lake, uh, that was spoken about at length on this call. Um, we expect to see a material improvement in production and reduction in costs over there. Uh, and the second one is the acquisition of Ernest Henry, uh, will be, uh, fully, uh, incorporated into our results on 100% basis from the 1st of January. Uh, and that will also have a material impact. All right. Good. I wasn't going to ask. Well, I thought I'd be a little bit different and not ask any questions on Ernest Henry, but thanks for, uh, including that answer. Um, given the, uh, the rain problems you've had in, in New South Wales and Queensland, um, just for example, in, uh, at Mt. Rawdon, what, uh, what tonnage of material, low grade material do you have stockpiled that you can keep the mill running on? I think we have very significant, uh, low grade stock piles. That's not the issue. The issue is more, uh, we wanna access the more profitable, um, low cost, uh, ounces in the pit. Right. But, uh, the, there's, um, if you had to depend, um, um, this is a hypothetical question. If you had to depend 100% on, uh, stock pile material, you have many years ahead of you, uh, I assume, uh, many years life left. Yes, we do. Right. Okay. Um- <inaudible>. what's the sit- what's the situation at Cowal? Uh, large stock piles there? Yes, very large, uh, stock piles there as well. Um, that's what we are treating before the, uh, we got into the stage age cut back, which we're now treating all grade materials, so, I'm very comfortable there as well. Yep. Good. Okay. Finally, look, uh, I've been asked to ask you what, what's your best contact, uh, way of contacting you? Uh, Dr. Sandra Close did attempt to, uh, well, did, did try to contact you or did contact, uh, the, uh, the office, uh, before Christmas, but got no reply. What's, what's the best way of, uh, uh, her getting something to you? I think if you go through the, the website, um, we will respond that. All right. Thanks. Best of luck. Good. Okay. Fine. That's me. Thanks very much. Thanks, Jim. Thank you. Your next question comes from Anthony Barich from SNP global. Please go ahead. Hi, Jake. I'm just wondering, you mentioned earlier on about, uh, some of the headwind, it seems to be front of mind. Just wondering, just for the gold sector, you know, um, how much are they front of mind in, in the context of what's going on in the bigger picture? You know, and are you, I'm not expecting any crystal balling for the gold sector or anything here, but are you overall more optimistic than not, you know, for the, for the, uh, coming year? Yeah, I'm very optimistic. I mean, we've repositioned our portfolio to be, you know, profitable right through the cycle, as we've said. Um, we've… You know, if you take our portfolio 12 months on from the beginning of 2021 to the end, uh, it's, it's materially better. We did the Mungari transaction. We, uh, the Kundana consolidation. Uh, we, we did the, um, the Ernest Henry transaction. Then we did the, um, the Battle North transaction to consolidate Red Lakes. So from our perspective, you know, the, the strategy remains the same, uh, focus on quality over quantity, return on capital, um, and, you know, benefit. The gold price is over A$ 2,500 an ounce. Um, I did reflect on the fact when I, that when I started in the industry, it was $300 an ounce. So, you know, if we're not happy at $2,500 an ounce, um, we need to find another, uh, another sector to operate in. We're, we're excited and happy about it. Um, yeah, the Fed Reserve meeting this morning told everyone what they knew, interest rates were gonna go up. Um, I didn't see anything that people should have been surprised about in, in that meeting. So now guess my, my question about, uh, overall, uh, overall optimistic, um, I was more referring to, yeah, th- that- that's our macro picture. So you, when you're refer to the US Fed there, you're obviously saying that's implications are that for the, for the gold sector, that's obviously looking good for the, for the coming year? <inaudible>. Yeah. I, I, I think the, you know, the question which everyone's asking, uh, uh, um, uh, Jerome Powell, the, the, the Fed Reserve chairman made the point this morning, that inflation is way higher than their target, and they need to start raising interest rates and, and managing, and, and, and, um, reducing their balance sheet. Yeah, that's the question, you know, is the Fed gonna be able to do that, uh, and do it in a way that, um, th- that is, uh, i- i- is not disruptive? And if I, if I were someone and I, uh, who, who needed, uh, insurance, I'd be buying gold and gold stocks like Evolution. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Klein for closing remarks. Uh, thanks. Uh, thanks everyone for participating. Appreciate it. Won't be long before you speak to us again, uh, with the release of our interim results in the middle of February. So look forward to updating you then, um, and look forward to being able to hopefully with travel restrictions, reducing, uh, to be able to take you to Ernest Henry, uh, take you to Red Lake, uh, and, uh, and also visit Cowal where there are lots of changes happening because seeing is really believing. So thanks. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
      "withCtc" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 Quarter Results Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Martin Cummings, General Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 Quarterly Conference Call. As Darcy mentioned, my name's Martin Cummings and I'm the General Manager Investor Relations. This morning on the call we have Jake Klein, our Executive Chairman, Laurie Conway, our CFO and Finance Director, and myself in our Group Office in Sydney. Bob Fulker, our Chief Chief Operating Officer, and Glenn Masterman, our VP Discovery and Business Development, are dialing in. It has been a tumultuous couple of years and has expected, gold's role as a safe haven during those times has been demonstrated. As the pandemic was breaking in early 2020, we saw gold rise from the low of fifteen hundreds per ounce to an all-time high around twenty seventy in August that year. We started twenty twenty one with the gold price down from its peak at just under US nineteen hundred per ounce. The economies were surging as they emerged from COVID lockdowns and equity markets were printing new highs. Bitcoin was continuing to generate a lot of interest, with some touting it as a new digital gold. And exposure to any metal that ended up in a Tesla was highly sought after. Gold couldn't catch a bit in early twenty twenty one and the sell off was brisk, down to sixteen eighty by March. Gold equities would follow, and by the end of September the G D X index of senior gold companies had fallen about twenty percent year to date, with the GDXJ junior index even lower, down around thirty percent. But in the last three months things have turned. Developing economies are now dealing with soaring inflation, with the Federal Reserve now indicating it will need to respond with rate increases soon. The Omicron COVID variant spread quickly, leading some countries to reintroduce or extend lockdowns and restrictions. And recently Russia and Ukraine tension has Europe on high alert. Bitcoin had an incredible journey in 2021, but has now given back most of those gains. Gold's role as a safe haven is returning and we now trade back up around US eighteen twenty per ounce. For Australian gold miners, the Australian gold dollar gold price also went on a wild ride, but we currently sit within ten to fifteen percent of its all time high. These really are great prices to be selling our product at. And of course copper had a standout year two, rising around twenty five percent. Evolution is well placed to benefit from this with our copper production materially increasing from this month. With that, I'll now hand over to Jake to introduce the December twenty twenty one quarterly report. Thanks Martin. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the call. Thanks for joining us and happy New Year. Despite the industry headwinds, COVID, labor shortages, and unseasonal rainfall, our teams did extremely well to manage the impact. As planned and first articulated to you in July, we anticipate the second half of the year to be materially better than the last six months and are on track to deliver our guidance. Given the first half performance at Red Lake, we expect to be in the bottom half of the production range and between the mid and top end of the cost guidance range. Last quarter, our portfolio was significantly improved by securing one hundred percent ownership of the iconic Ernest Henry Copper Gold Mine. We also concluded the sale of Mount Cardin to Navarre Minerals and whilst retaining exposure to the future of the operation, the sale allows us to focus on our larger, higher margin assets. We continue to be consistent and diligent in the implementation of our strategy of improving the quality of our portfolio and being laser focused about putting ourselves into a position where we can generate sector leading returns on the capital we deploy. In our view, this is the holy grail in our industry and is the true measure of a gold company's performance over the long term. I visited Ernest Henry last week and left very confident that in the December quarter we concluded what is likely to prove one of the most transformative deals in evolution's history. It is an outstanding operation with a great team and terrific geological upside. We look forward to hosting a number of you there for a site visit in due course. The foundations for the transaction were put in place in twenty sixteen when we secured the economic interest in the asset, and since then have built a strong and mutually respectful relationship with Glencore that allowed us to negotiate this deal on a bilateral exclusive basis over the course of a few months last year. Our economic interest delivered seventy nine point five million dollars in cash flow last quarter, and now with one hundred percent of the operation being included from one January, we expect its impact to be even bigger going forward. The CAVE extension pre feasibility study will be a priority, and with intersections four hundred meters below the study area and still open below that, Ernest Henry has a long and very exciting future. Cal performed extremely well and managed to deliver to plan in spite of unprecedented rainfall and COVID interruptions. The Underground Project, which will grow cows production to 350,000 ounces per annum, remains on schedule and budget. I was also fortunate to be able to visit Red Lake in November last year. Due to COVID travel restrictions, this was my first visit since we took ownership of the asset in April 2020. Red Lake is one of the best commercial opportunities I've seen in the gold sector in my career. For the combined purchase price of six hundred and fifty million US dollars, being Red Lake and Battle North, we have secured a district scale tenement tenement position with eleven million ounces of resource and significant exploration upside, seven kilometers of prospective strike with associated mining infrastructure, three mils and $700 million of Canadian tax losses. In time, this asset will be transformed into plus $350,000 ounce a year low-cost producer. This is how values created in our sector. As you will hear from Bob, who has just returned from his third visit in the last five months, progress is being made. Last quarter we, consistently achieved over twelve hundred meters of development each month. As a result of this and other improvements, we are confident of a material and sustainable improvement to production in the next two quarters. We expect this higher production to drive the cost per ounce lower, and I'm looking forward to visiting the operation again with Laurie in the next few weeks. Frustratingly, Mungari remains the only asset in our portfolio that we cann can onot currently visit. We are fortunate to have a good team in Western Australia, have led the Kandana integration, which has gone well, and we are growing increasingly confident about the future and the potential of this operation. Mount Rawdon was impacted by heavy rainfall and was forced to process the low-grade stockpile material. Strategically, we continue to assess the potential of Mount Rawdon to be converted into a pumped hydrogener, which could be a significant contributor of renewable energy to the Southeast Queensland grid at the end of its mine life. This last quarter, the highlights for the discovery team were good intersections at Kew in Western Australia, and also more intriguing and exciting intersections at Red Lake, where there is plenty of open space and interesting geology to discover another high-grade zone. Gwen and his team are also plotting and planning the next phase of drilling at Ernest Henry. Whilst we are managing industry headwinds, we should not ignore the significant commodity price tailwinds. A gold price of over twenty five hundred Australian dollars and a copper price, which going forward will represent around twenty percent of our revenue of over thirteen and a half thousand Australian dollars per tonne. Evolution is well positioned to benefit from this. I'll now hand over to Bob to provide some more detail on the operational performance. Thanks, Jake, and uh good morning everyone. The December quarter saw our drift stabilise at nine point four, the highlight being a thirty five percent reduction in the twelve month moving average at Mungari. The December quarter gold production is the first reported without Mount Carlton's contribution. The quarter's gold production was 148,000 ounces, with a 5% improvement in the oil and sustaining cost to $1,347 an ounce. Despite the challenges faced with above average rainfall and COVID, Cal had a strong quarter delivering 60,000 ounces at an all-insustained cost of $998 an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of $80.6 million. Capital investment ramped up at Cal, with sixty million spent on major projects this quarter. This included twenty-four million on the IWL and thirty-three point five million on the underground development. Underground development rates will ramp up in the March quarter with a second jumbo commencing in December, and the selection of the primary mining contractor is on track for the March quarter. The project remains on budget and on schedule. The RWR stage two deposition has run smoothly throughout the quarter. Ernest Henry produced 21,000 ounces of gold and four point one thousand ounces of copper at an all-insustaining cost of a negative eight hundred and eighty two dollars an ounce. The higher AISC compared to the September quarter is primarily driven, primarily driven by lower copper production due to lower mining planned uh lower planned mining tons. The net mine cash flow remains strong at seventy nine point.5 million, another significant contribution to the portfolio. I'm pleased to say this will be the last quarter reporting Ernest Henry as an economic interest. Integration activities are well underway, and I'm excited to have Er thenest Henry team as part of the Evolution family. The pre-feasibility study for the mine extension below the 1125 RL has commenced and will incorporate the recent drilling results indicating mineralization extends further than assumed in the concept study. Completion of the study is expected in H1 FY23. Moving on to Red Lake, over the past five months I've been on site three times. Each time I see an improvement and step change in performance and develop and delivery. Although still work in progress, pleasingly many key metrics are moving in the right direction. Red Lake produced 20,000 ounces for the quarter, and although their all-in-sustaining cost is not where we need it to be, the operating mine cash flow for the quarter was a positive. And with it and we spent thirteen point nine million in sustaining capital and thirty six point nine million on major capital for future production. For the past couple of quarters I've been talking about development. Pleasingly, during the December quarter, each month was above our long our long-term transformation goal of twelve hundred meters per month. The December quarter was twenty-one percent higher than the September quarter. I expect this to continue, allowing additional mining fronts to be opened. Campbell Mill continues to do achieve new records and approval has been granted to lift the daily throughput restriction of two thousand tons per day for a limited trial in the second half of the financial year to support the Campbell Mill expansions. While still not where we want them to be, there have been significant improvements through the quarter. Stope cycle time has improved by twenty five percent. Stope idle time has improved by 60%. Time to drill per stope has improved by 27%. And slot drilling has halved with the V30 implementation. Stope extraction quality focused has delivered a 19% improvement in stope recovery, a three percent reduction in dilution, and a fifteen percent increase in our oil mine to quarter and quarter. And in December, the grade lifted to four point nine grams per tonne. Looking forward to H2, we're expecting expecting to see a continual improvement in delivery from the underground and the two mills operating. Notable improvements for the second half of the year, uh tons processed will increase with the Red M Red Lake Mill running and the Campbell Mill rate extension. Grade mine is lifting as dilution reduces and plans for early ore from the CYD development continue. Increased tons from Koshna, the transfer haulage locomotion locomotives performance has improved by forty three percent last quarter, and replacement locomotives will be commissioned this quarter, further reducing downtime and increased number of mining horizons and continuing the improvement in stoke design and execution to further enhance our ore delivery and quality. Mandugari is moving forward post integration. For the quarter they produce thirty-four thousand ounces of gold at an all-insustaining cost of eighteen hundred and twenty-nine dollars an ounce and generate an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of twenty point seven million. Oe grade process increased thirty four percent over the last quarter, as the proportion of underground ore in the feed increased from fifty four percent to sixty seven percent. Workforce integration is ongoing with a focus on establishing a one team approach. The sharing of resources across the field has commenced in enabling better deployment of equipment and resources to priority areas, which has been critical as a site navigates high vacancy rates and COVID related impacts. Mount Rawdon produced twelve point four thousand ounces at an only sustaining cost of eighteen hundred forty two dollars an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of eleven point nine million. As previously mentioned, weather significantly impacted access to the pit, resulting in reduced oil movements. As a result, stockpile feed increased, directly affecting gold grade and production. In summary, some great improvements were made at Radlake and Mungari throughout the quarter. The Cal Underground Project continues to hit milestones, and the official ownership of the Ernest Henry Mine has added additional opportunities for the portfolio. Thank you for your time and I'll hand over to Glenn. Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Firstly at our QJoint vanch here in Western Australia, we've advised our partner Musgrave Minerals that we will be taking full management and operatorship of the project, which occurred on January 1st of this year. Recent results from diamond drilling at the West Island Prospect outlined on page fifteen of this morning's report importantly confirmed the potential for high grade mineralisation within individual loads. Drilling has also identified multiple new load structures in the favorable dollarite host in various locations along strike. The geometric relationships between structures and dollarite imply individual loads may be limited by their potential strike length, but remain open at de.pth The Air Corps drilling program has been very important in further delineating the favorable dolorite host and associated golden anomalism along strike from the original West Island drilling. The results have unlocked new areas with the necessary geological ingredients for mineralization to occur up to five kilometers from West Island. One of the challenges with all of our drilling programs, is long delays waiting to receive assay results results in time to inform where to drill next. This is an industry wide issue and is holding back the ability to accelerate drilling programs in the ways we would like to. At Q, we are still waiting on results from five diamond holes and over 70 aircore holes, which restricts our ability to sensibly add additional drilling resources. At Red Lake, two deep holes were completed as wide space step-outs from the original intercept reported last quarter on the Rzone extension. One of the holes intersected high-grade mineralization 200 metres away from the first hole, with the other hole drilling through the structure. However, it did not return significant mineralization. The results reported on page 12 are encouraging because they unlock a large area of real estate that has not been previously drilled along the extension of the R zone structure. Follow up drilling is currently stepping off the high grade intercept in Hole sixty nine to expand the potential scale of mineralization in this area. At Mungari, drilling underground at Kandana and East Kandana continued its concentration on small resource extensions and classification upgrades on future mining areas adjacent to existing development. Step out drilling into the foot wall of the K2 structure from the underground at Hornet has returned further promising intercepts of stacked load style mineralization at Star Trek. Follow-up drilling is underway to understand the significance of eliminated veining in hole twenty-one thirty reported on page fourteen of this morning's report. The geology is similar to what would be expected on the main K two structure at A R HP, which is worthy of priority follow up drilling. At Bernest Henry, we have assessed H two drilling priorities which will be focused on developing all body knowledge for the PFS, along with de-risking areas of the resource that require additional data support before production is scheduled. As Bob and Jake mentioned earlier, strong copper gold mineralization has been intercepted at the four hundred and eighty metre R L and remains open down plunge. With that, I'll hand over to Laurie. Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide a brief update on the financial performance for the quarter as outlined on pages nine and ten of the report. For the group we produced one hundred and forty eight thousand ounces at an all insustaining cost of thirteen forty seven per ounce. This aligns with our guidance where we said the production would increase over the year and the all-in-sustaining costs would trend down from around fourteen fifty per ounce in the first quarter. The AISC was approximately five percent lower than the September quarter. Our focus on portfolio quality is evident in that, on a like-for-like basis, the divestment of Mount Carlton operation reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $28 per ounce this quarter. As our production and cost profile changes in the second half, the cost benefit from this divestment will improve further. Group production and cost guidance remain unchanged. At six hundred and seventy to seven hundred and twenty-five thousand ounces at an all-in-sustaining cost of eleven thirty-five to eleven ninety-five per ounce. With the performance of Red Lake in the first half, we expect to be at the bottom end of the production range and between in the top half of the cost guidance range. In terms of cash flow, we were fairly well in line with plan, excluding the underperformance at Red Lake. We generated two hundred and three million of operating cash flow, which is up four point six percent, and thirteen percent excluding Mount Carlton. On a per ounce basis, our operating cash flow was up ten percent quarter on quarter. This was against a flat gold price and lower copper revenue, where the higher copper price was offset by planned lower copper volumes at Ernest Henry. Net mine cash flow was fifty three million, with our capital programs remaining on plan. We invested around thirty four million dollars in sustaining capital, while major project investment increased to one hundred and fourteen million as projects at Cal and Red Lake progressed. Group capital guidance remains unchanged at one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy five million for sustaining and four hundred and forty to five hundred and five million for major projects. We'll see an immediate benefit of the acquisition of the hundred percent of Ernest Henry, where our AISC will reduce materially in the second half of the year. More importantly, though, our cash flow will be increasing. Based on our guidance and depending on the economy, we have a lot of the copper price achieved in the second half, we expect to realise an additional eighty to one hundred and thirty million dollars of net mine cash flow at Ernest Henry. This will be taken into consideration when determining our interim dividend. As previously announced, during the quarter we successfully priced a US two hundred million dollar US private placement for nine years at very attractive pricing to partially fund the Ernest Henry acquisition. This will be drawn down next month. We ended December with one point one five billion of cash and net debt of four hundred and fifty million. Our unaudited gearing is around twelve point six per% prior to the payment for Ernest Henry in early January. We are on track to be below the twenty nine percent projected at the time of announcing the acquisition, and we expect to quickly be back within our targeted gearing levels and maintain a very strong balance sheet. I look forward to updating you next month on the FY twenty two interim financial results. Thank you for your time this morning and Darcy, please open the line for questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. Your first question comes from David Radcliffe from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. Hi, good good morning, Jake. and team So m uh my question's on Red Lake. The the commentary around mining rates does seem uh you know more optimistic today, which is great, uh especially with respect to I guess the mine efficiencies and dilution and and opening up more mining freights uh fronts. So just trying to think how we should think about you know the high development rates converting into higher mine tons over sort of this year and if you could maybe provide some sort of quantum how that comes through over the next kind of couple of quarters. Uh and then on grade, how we should sort of think about those numbers over the year. Obviously there's going to be the sweetener from Campbell, but you know, when do we from the the operations today, how do we move closer to that reserve grade of six given that you're currently sort of seeing the four? Thanks, David. Uh those are good questions. Um I mean I think we you know we are going through a transformation uh y we've called it a three to five year transformation at Red Lake. Uh the last six months have taught us a lot about the operation. Uh we've focused on the development and we've put we've specifically taken the decision to I suppose sacrifice production over development and getting ready and setting the trunk the transformation up. And we now feel that we've kind of bottomed and we're at a point where you're really going to see improvements in that. So the development rates are up. The improvements in in mining are are getting better. As Bob highlighted and he can talk further to it, you know, dilution has been reduced. Uh we're comfortable that the models are performing. Um we need to open up some of these higher grade areas which are gonna be happening over the next few months. Um so it's a it's a journey. Uh we're on the right path, um and you are gonna see uh material improvements to production and lowering of costs uh in the next quarter and following quarters. Bob, do you wanna add to that? Yeah, thanks uh Jake. Uh David S. Jake said um the expectation is that as we get the development in uh to the new areas and it takes a long time uh to to go out and to open up new areas, then the mining fronts will open up which will help stabilise and increase the the tonnages. We've started to see an increase in tonnages last quarter through the quarter, um although it's not as high as we need it yet, but it's still it's growing. Um a and areas like uh aviation and the like uh they do take a bit of time to to set up so uh I would expect that um over the next couple of quarters you'll start to see those tonnages come in. Uh as gr uh Jake said also on the grade, um, you know, we are getting a lot better um with the refonciliations of of um dilution and um and the like, as I mentioned, all the all the numbers. Um I I expect that over the coming quarters we'll see um that continue to to improve. Drin, did you want to comment on the model specifically? Sure, Bob. I I think um you know one of the things that we're starting to see, David, is that um particularly with our reconciliations so, our our Dom to grade control and our Dom to all reserve. Um we're starting to see an upward tick um you know particularly on the grade front as as we improve, particularly some of the you know the mining related factors as Bob has just described, dilution, recovery. Um and and we've improved our grade control system. So we we are starting to see that upward tick in the grade. Uh and particularly on a three month moving average, it's uh w it's starting to trend into the direction where we need it to be. So we we have confidence uh that the models um you know are performing uh to plan and and we're just aligning that with the the way we're mining and w and um yeah we're confident that we'll start to see that where it needs to be over the next coming quarters. I just uh conclude um that David with a a comment around the fact that we've owned this asset for twenty one months. Um it's only been in the last five months that we've been able to visit the the operation. Uh but when we bought the asset in April twenty nineteen we said our three year goal was to get to a run rate of two hundred thousand ounces of gold uh and then a longer term five year um horizon of three hundred and fifty thousand ounces a year. And uh we are uh committed to delivering that uh on both thirtyx- montsih and sixty month targets. Brilliant. Thanks very much guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Your next question comes from Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. about eighteen months for the PFS. Um just wondering if if this is going to um take on much of the the work that Glencore did or if it'll be kind of a complete recut incorporating that those further depth extensions and I think Glenn you mentioned it was going down to four hundred and eighty metres um and still open beyond. So where potentially could you um would you kinda draw the line on on those depth extensions and and and where this study will kind of finish up. Yes. So the the just to clarify, the study will be um delivered in the second half of this calendar year. So first half of FY twenty three. So we're kind of uh say nine months away t from delivery of that. Um it will build on um the concept study which uh was completed by Glencore. Um I suppose one of the things which we found intriguing as we've looked at the concept study is that it was uh determined really on the basis of um minimizing the capital expenditure which meant that the depth extent of the concept study went down to as far as the decline could go and you could cruck material up. Uh so it wasn't constrained or limit uh determined by geology, it was more determined by how far can we develop how deep can we develop, which was kind of four to five year mine life extension, um uh with a decline development and not needing to uh spend significant capital. So the priority was really minimizing capital expenditure and extending mine life which constrained it to that four to five years. So our prefee will's look at that as well, uh, but we'll also look at some longer dated options as to whether there is potential to extend it even further beyond that, uh which certainly from my site visit there was a lot of optimism from the site team that that was uh possible. Yep. Thanks, Jake. Maybe just quickly on Red Lake, um, you got the approval for the higher throughput um trial. How how long will that um trial last and then and then what are the permitting steps that will follow follow that there? Bob, do you want to take that question? Yep, thanks Al. Um the um the trial is actually we're permitted for uh a a a six to eight week period of basically unlimited throughput through the Campbell Mill. And the reason we want to uh we wanted the trial was det to determine uh how far we could actually push the uh the mill. Um so uh really it's uh it's a short period of time. Uh that will allow us to then uh be able to go and actually seek the the approvals for a permanent lift. At the moment you need a an engineering study and we actually believe that we can actually get um all the data we need um out of this trial to to be able to go and actually seek the the permitting. Thanks Bob. And if I could just sneak one more in, just with Cal, there was a small contribution from um the underground this quarter. I thought we were kind of gonna expect that a little bit a little bit later. So is this is this material a one off or can we kind of expect uh underground to start contributing more and and seeing that ramp up over the next few quarters. Bob Uh we're on track for the the time frame that we've actually spoken about earlier, uh Al. There will be minor uh contributions coming through as we uh develop through uh different zones, uh but it won't be significant in the immediate future. Um but we're on track to to deliver first or as we said. Uh I'm just trying to remember exactly the time frame. I can't remember, sorry. I'd have to go and check it. Jake. No, I d I don't think there was any contribution or material contribution from the underground, it remains on on track and on schedule. No worries. Thank you. Your next question comes from Daniel Morgan from Barren Joey. Please go ahead. Uh hi Jake and Tim. Uh just on Red Lake, um, can you just run through on why FY twenty two guidance is still achievable, albeit at the low end of the ranch. Um it does imply the next two quarters have got a very strong production run rate of over fifty thousand ounces. I guess we're at the end of January, so you should have visibility on that data, but um it just seems a big lift. You know, what what is underpinning that? Do you have you know high grade stopes available? Is it you know, running this trial um of the the plant, you know, does that give you more production? Just you know, how is guidance achievable? Yeah, Dan, thanks. I mean we've specifically said that group guidance is achievable. Um i we're not gonna make the the asset guidance at at Red Lake, um but you know we we're not feeling um that we want to be granular enough to say you know how much we can produce because all these all these steps are in in on in place and are showing improvements um but on a group basis and I think that's what investors should look at. Uh you know, we are confirming that we will make our guns range. Ah right, I must I might have misinterpreted the comment that it was a group comment. Apologies. Um just on red leg, maybe take taking a step back. Could you maybe break out um what are the critical elements that need to be in place for the for the turnaround to occur? Because obviously a lot of these are not in place at at currenther, whet that's equipment, whether that's the um you know, the access to the up the upper Campbell or or or the mill throughputs. Can you just unpick, you know, when these pieces to the turnaround will be in place or expected to be in place and and you know when we can expect that. Sure. Bob, you've just recovered from jet lag from your latest trip there, so over to you. Thanks, Jake, and thanks Dan. As we talked about earlier, the big one to start with was getting the development to open up new areas. But post that we've actually been working on the slope turnaround cycle um and the the time to initial from initial development through to uh filling of a stop so we can uh keep the sequence going for the next um uh for the next stop which comes along right right beside the previous uh filled stopes. So we've been working on uh long hole drill rates, we've been working on pace fill um placement, uh we've been working on reentry times as well as um as stoping and turnover of the actual stopes. So all those together is really is what is enabling the lift last quarter of of our oe tons by I think it's about fifteen percent from the from the previous quarter. So that comes around because we can actually get into the stage quicker a and and more regularly. Um if we actually look at the additional uh mining fronts, what it enables us to do is actually spread the mining fleet out so that interruption and and uh disruption uh from interacting activities is is limited even further. So that allows us to actually turn the actual cycles quicker because we actually don't have the same uh disruption factors. Um a big one for coming quarters is Koshner. Um and last quarter uh, the the um the high speed tram or the uh the uh locomotive that takes the ore from kosher across the reedshaft, that improves significantly from the previous quarter and and that is one of the main things that will allow us because Koshner has got uh a a good turnover cycle uh of its start already. Did I sort of try to answer it? Uh w uh when when is access coming to the to the upper Campbell um for instance? So go ahead go ahead. I was just going to say the upper Campbell, um, so the CYD is actually accessing the upper Campbell, and we're already down into um that area uh with the CYD. First stope ore was always said to be around about twelve months after. So and that still is on on track. Um we will get minor amounts of of development ore earlier, uh the same as at Cal I mean as you as you go through areas you'll you'll in intercept some sort of minor um oil zones. Um but anything from a start will still be within that twelve months from first starting. Jake, did you want to add anything to that? No, other than that you were walking around it uh last week and you um you felt positive about the you know th the outlook over there. I I mean I I suppose the thing that I would add to all this commentary on Red Lake is that each time someone's been there, and particularly Bob, uh who's made several trips, um, you know, there are no red flags with respect to our delivery of this. It's getting uh our operational efficiency uh better down and you know I I still believe this is as I said in my commentary uh this is an amazing commercial opportunity where we've acquired assets that need transformation. Uh it's gonna take some time. Uh we've had a few hiccups in the last six months, but you know there are no red flags with respect to delivery and transforming this operation. tonnages or or the potential ore within that uh Campbell zones. Uh Daniel I I I walked nine, eleven, fourteen and a few other levels this time, and it's uh it's right for the taking, it's just that the access we've got to get there. So that's what's taking the time. Thank you. And the last question would probably be a bit simpler. Um just Mungari. Um just the numbers on page four. Can I just get a confirmation on whether these are equity numbers or or do they have J V production in them? I just want to make sure I'm treating like with like here. Sorry. Yeah. Dan, so the the physicals up up the top will be a hundred percent of what's processed when we're talking about um gold production, silver production, that is our equitable share. So we're we're wanting to show um what the actual mining and processing has been able to do. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Levi Spry from UBS. Please go ahead. Just follow up on Dave and Dan's questions there around Red Lake. Um Bob, do we get the tons and grades for the second half? And and do I assume that the three year two hundred thousand ounces means that we're going for a fifty thousand ounce per quarter run rate in sort of you know twelve months or whatever exactly ten months. I think before Bob answers that I I I'll have a good Happy New Year, Levi. Um y yes is is the i is the answer to your last question. You know, to get to two hundred thousand ounces we need to get to consistently doing a run rate of fifty thousand ounces per quarter. Um we'd prefer not to kind of break down into tons and grade for the next six months because we just feel we want to build confidence ourselves uh on a group guidance basis. We are comfortable, we'll make the the the guidance range, uh but would prefer just to give us give us an another couple of months um to just get comfortable that these that these changes that we're seeing are gonna be repeatable and consistently deliverable. Yep. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Jack. Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead. Is that um is there a reason for that or or should we be expecting a lift in the second half? Yeah, Alex, it it is just basically um timing more than anything. Um we expect that their second half will will lift. I mean the primary focus in the first half was getting the the underground and the IWL um projects continuing and in the second half you'll see some sustaining capital come through. Right, no problem. And uh a quick one at Red Lake, uh just to follow up on what's been asked. So for for the second quarter, can we confirm that there was no grade reconciliation issues? Uh yeah, there there was dilution, but that was improving uh and in the in in the month of December we felt very comfortable that it we'd we'd addressed some of the issues that we were getting in terms of both dilution um a and um and we feel confident that the models are performing to plan. Yeah, okay. Yeah I I was sort of talking about the model that you answered me there. Thanks very much guys. Yeah. Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Friedman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sure. Thanks morning, Jake and Team. Um I don't want to labour the point on Red Lake and you did kind of just touch on it there, Jake, but I I'm just wondering, you know, you you've highlighted on the call and and in the report a number of ways that you know, tons are improving and volumes are improving, you know, we can see mining rates lifting, development rates lifting, but obviously grade keeps falling. Um you've been underperforming the reserve grade for a year now. So I guess does it you know does that mean we'll see an overperformance at some point? Um is there a need to rethink some of the dilution assumptions and and other factors that underpin that reserve grade. You said you you know you're comfortable with the way the model's performing at the moment, but uh I guess there's another year of data on this asset um you know now uh I guess lead lead to any sort of expectations or anything that we should think about at the next um mineral reserve uh sorry, mineral resource or reserve update. Um, you know, any any anything to think about in terms of that? Yeah, thanks, Matt. I mean a good good question again. And Bob and his team have been doing a lot of work on understanding that and and again we came to the we are of the view empirically that the models are performing to plan. But Bob, maybe you can give uh some colour as to some of the issues and then hand over to Glenn to just uh give some guidance on the uh on the MRI. Yeah, no problems. How are you going mate? Um the number that I quoted uh thro when I was speaking, that was the December number. So the number in the report is um i is an average for the quarter of three point nine five and in December it did lift to to four point nine, which is starting to show out some of the uh dilution uh issues that were I spoke about being under control. It's also showing some uh uh improvements in uh drilling accuracy and um and the like within the stopes. So it's actually starting to improve significantly. And that's why what Jake said about we're pretty confident on the on the models. Um we're working on all those things. Are we where we need to be? I still think we've got improvements to be had, so I still think that there's there's further uplifts to come. Um but it is actually all moving in the right direction, so it's pretty pretty pleasing. Um Glenn, did you want to talk uh a comment on the model? Yeah, thanks Bob. Yeah Matt um I think uh just a you know really I guess a bit of a a preview um you know on our MRLR update which we'll uh come out with mid next month. Um as you'll recall when we when we when we did the sort of I guess the evolution update to bring it in as compliance uh you know with with Jork, um we consolidated the models from over a hundred and thirty to nineteen principal models. Um in the last twelve months um we'll we've had new data and mining from six of those models. So so they are the ones that um you know we're going to be revising uh into the MRLI annual update. We're not seeing, you know, really any material movement in in in the resource and that's from a tons and grade perspective, and assuming that the same cutoff grades as we previously have, which is around about three and a half grams per ton on a mineral resource basis. Um we do um you know what w the the new data that we're collecting is really confirming uh some of the geological interpretations. Um there are some small changes, there'll be swings and roundabouts, you know, in areas where we didn't have, you know, as much data support as we would have liked, but that uh that's to be s expected. So I think, you know, all in all, um we're not expecting to see you know any material change. Um sort of you know year over year in terms of the actual geological model and how it informs the the the resource estimate. And I think from sort of looking at this in a great amount of detail, Bob and the uh his technical team and Glenn and the resource. Uh you know, we are confident that yeah we are addressing the mining issues. Um and you with good mining practice uh we should be able to get the grade that is in the models. Got it. Thanks Jake and and thanks for the context, Glenn. Um just secondly uh on Ernest Henry um and obviously congrats to the team on on closing that transaction over Christmas and and the new year. I hope they did manage to get some kind of a holiday. But um just wondering in terms of y you you mentioned that the the copper production during the quarter was a bit lower than than pl sorry, the lower copper production during the quarter was I guess to pl to plan and potentially that's attributable to to lower grades quarter on quarter. Um that asset is still mining above reserve grades for copper in particular. Just wondering when we should be thinking about a a roll off back to reserve grades for that asset. You know, did we see that in the December quarter? Um and then you know, I guess similar to the to the last question, you know, anything to think about in terms of incorporating that um reserve and resource into your next update, you know, now that that's been reported on a hundred percent basis, I believe it's already a JORK standard resource. But yeah, any any movements there to think about um now that it's fully uh evolution ownership. Yeah, thanks Matt. Glenn, do you want to just comment on on the resource? Yeah, sure, Jake. So so on the on the resource, Matt, we yeah, we will be providing an update um mid next month which will incorporate, you know, information uh up until about May last year, which will be the um when when GLECCOR did their their last resource update. So it'll be update reflecting that point in time and it won't incorporate all the drilling information that uh we've collected, you know, between May and December. So that will obviously be rolled into our MROR cycle as we go ahead this 12 month period to to really incorporate all that information in in in addition to the the new drilling that'll be um that that that is in the plan for this year. And Matt, just on the production, it was it was a combination. So in the in the quarter we had a shutdown, uh which was a planned shutdown and it also um a shutdown in the mine. So we we did end up with some lower grades coming through and as as we look at the the rest of the year you do see that the average grade being mined um is is coming back down certainly from where the first quarter was. And the second thing that did impact on on copper in this quarter w were some finalizations of of the previous quarters um uh concentrate sales. So that did have a bit of an impact on the on the copper piece in particular. So it's y you what you'll see on if you look at it uh as a half, um you're going to see that then flow through into the second half as a pretty well a light for light. If once you gross it up to a hundred once you gross it up to a hundred percent, obviously. Right,. got it Thanks Laurie and uh thanks for the comments, Glenn. Thank you. The next question comes from Mitch Ryan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Uh good morning all. Uh thank you very much for the taking out the questions. Um quick question with regards to um Red Lake but but more of a longer term dated question. Just wondering if you could provide an update on Battle North and the acquisition there, specifically around the milling capacity. Part of the the rationale for that was was to potentially bring that that milling capacity online. Um can you give us an update on the permitting processes for that? How much attention's actually being able to be spent on that given the focus on just I guess consolidating um the base level of production in the existing red lake operations. Sure. Bob over to you. The um so the the Battle North um processing plant, um it it's it's there, it's operational if we wanted to start it. We we are uh um replacing uh some parts that um uh need replacing. The the big issue at uh at the uh the Bateman plant is the TSF and we're working through that at the moment. Um for the next sort of uh twelve odd ish months uh our capacity at Red Lake and Campbell uh are going to be enough. So that's what we're we're doing, the permitting and all the work to bring it in on time when we actually need it. From the rest of Battle North, uh, we're still doing work in the underground. Um we're doing some drilling that uh Glenn could talk about. Um so we've done done some grade control drilling over there, uh just to gallery our knowledge on the on your bodies as well. Okay. Thank you, that's it for me. Thanks, Mitch. Your next question comes from Stuart McKinnon from the West Australian. Please go ahead. Oh, good day, Jake and Team. Um I was just intrigued by the um uh the mention in the quarterly about uh up to fifteen percent of your workforce being um effectively knocked out at Red Lake and Cal at various times because of COVID. Obviously uh you know COVID hasn't hasn't been sort of a wash in the community as it has in those those other places, Canada and New South Wales, uh in WA. Are you expecting that you know eventually you're gonna have those have to the same challenges at your WA operations, uh in terms of COVID and managing the workforce as you do at Red Lake and Cal, and how much of more of an impact is that going to be given that you know you're already sort of uh short on workers given the the you know the WA situation with the uh uh you know a labour market shortage just generally in in the resources industry? Yes, J that's that's a good question. Um look we're obviously watching it and monitoring it as clo uh very closely um and you know trying to put in the contingency plans and the learnings which we've got from managing it and we've managed it effectively uh at Red Lake and Cal. Um but you know, unless there is a uh some s uh s someone finds a cure uh for covet, which does not seem to be the case 'cause people who are triple VAC still seem to to be catching the Omnicron uh variants uh in in New South Wales and Canada and around the world, uh then you'd have to think that at some point in time if West Western Australia opens up, uh Omnicron is gonna is gonna spread through Western Australia. So we are gonna do our best to put in contingency plans, but if you couple that with uh a skills shortage, uh it does put uh the whole mining industry in Western Australia at at some risk. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that, Jake. Thank you. Your next question comes from Nick Evans from The Australian. Please go ahead. Um great, sorry about that, just juggling my phone. Um great uh great team. Um just um just to follow up to his question, Jake. It just in terms of New South Wales in particular, uh how are you sort of thinking about the the spread of Tharmicon in New South Wales? Do you think that sort of Cow or or Europe have seen the worst of it? Or what are you expecting this kind of level of absenteeism to um continue for some time. And just in the in terms of WA, I I thought I detected a a sort of a a note of frustration in your voice when you talked about not being able to have um not being able to visit it. I mean do you think that um in terms of dealing with the inevitable splitting WA that the state government should have bitten the bullet and and done it now or or do you think there was um you know there was some benefit to to delaying the reopening in WA. Uh thanks, Nico. I I I'll answer the second question first. Yeah, uh our our preference would have been to have the Western Australian border opened um earlier. Um you know, it just seems like you're in some ways deferring the inevitable uh by keeping it closed, as I said earlier, unless there is a cure which is not on the horizon, um, it is going to be present and it is going to have to be dealt with at some point in time, even if it is deferred. Um, it's not going to be eliminated. Um, it does feel like other places, uh like New South Wales and uh Ontario and the rest of the world is learning how to manage this. Um and certainly at our operations, while it has been a big distraction, uh we have been able to manage through it and uh we are getting more comfortable that we can we can manage it. Um it has um distracted the management teams a lot um but with proper process and um proper protocols, uh it can be managed effectively. Thanks, Jake. Appreciate that next question comes from Jim Pollock from Sabaton Associates. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning everybody. And uh thanks uh Jake. Um I think it was you who said in your introduction that the second half of the financial year uh would be materially better. I was just wondering where we can expect to see uh material uh improvements um in in which operations. Yeah Jim I think thanks. Um uh there are two areas which I'd say you should look out for. Uh the one is Red Lake, uh that we've spoken about at length on this call. Um we expect to see a material improvement in production and reduction in costs over there. Uh and the second one is the acquisition of Ernest Henry uh will be uh fully uh incorporated Right, good. I wasn't going to ask well I thought I'd be a little bit different and not ask any questions on Ernest Henry, but thanks for uh including that answer. Um given the um uh the rain problems you've had in in New South Wales and Queensland. Um just for example, in um at Mount Roughton, what uh what tonnage of uh material, low grade material do you have stockpiled that you can keep the mill running on? I think we have very significant uh low grade stockpiles. That's not the issue. The issue is more uh we want to access the more profitable um lower cost uh ounces in the pit. Right. But uh th there's uh um if you had to depend I'm I'm this is a hypothetical question. If you had to depend a hundred percent on uh stockpile material you have many years ahead of you uh I assume uh many years life left. Yes we do. Right, okay. Um what's the s what's the situation at Cowell? Uh large stockpiles there? Yes, very large uh stockpiles there as well. Um that's what we were treating before the uh we got into the stage eight cutback, which we're now treating all grade material. So Yep, good. Okay, finally, look, uh I've been asked to ask you what what's your best contact uh way of contacting you? Uh Doctor Sandra Close did attempt to uh well did did try to contact you or did contact uh the uh the office uh before Christmas but got no reply. What's what's the best way of uh uh her getting something to you? I think if you go through the the website um we will respond to it. Right. Right. Good. Okay, fine. That's me. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from Anthony Barrage from S and P Global. Please go ahead. Hi Jake. Um just wondering you mentioned early on about uh s some of the headwinds that seem to be fronts of mind. Just wondering for just for the gold sector, you know, um how much are they fronts of mind in in the context of what's going on in the bigger picture? Uh you know, and are you I'm not expecting any crystal balling for the gold sector or anything here, but are you overall more optimistic than not, you know, for the for the uh coming year? Yeah, I'm very optimistic. I mean we've repositioned our portfolio to be yeah, profitable right through the cycle, as we've said. Um we've imp you know if you take our portfolio twelve months on from the beginning of twenty twenty one to the end, uh it's it's materially better. We did the Mungari transaction, we uh the Kandana consolidation, uh we did the um the Ernest Henry transaction and we did the um the Battle North transaction to consolidate Red Lake. So from our perspective, you know, the the strategy remains the same. Uh focus on quality over quantity, return on capital, um and you know benefit. The gold price is over twenty five hundred Australian dollars an ounce. Um I did reflect on the fact when I that when I started in the industry it was three hundred dollars an ounce. So yeah, if we're not happy at twenty five hundred dollars an ounce, um we need to find another uh another sector to operate in. We're we're excited and happy about it. Um yeah, the Fed Reserve meeting this morning told everyone what they knew. Interest rates were gonna go up. Um I didn't see anything that people should have been surprised about in in that meeting. So no I guess my my uh question about uh overall uh overall optimistic um I was more referring to yeah th that that's our macro picture. So you when you refer to the US Fed there, you're obviously saying that's implications are that for the for the gold sector that's obviously looking good for the for the coming year? Crystal Boy, you're coming. Jerome Powell, the the the Fed Reserve Chairman made the point this morning that inflation is way higher than their target and they need to start i raising interest rates and and manage it and and and um reducing their balance sheet. Yeah, that's the question. Yeah, is the Fed gonna be able to do that? Uh and do it in a way that's um th that is uh i i i is not disruptive and yeah, if I if I were someone and I uh uh who who needed uh insurance I'd be buying gold and gold stops like evolution. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Klein for closing remarks. Uh thanks. Uh thanks everyone for participating. Appreciate it. It won't be long before you speak to us again with the release of our interim results in the middle of February. So look forward to updating you then. Um and look forward to being able to hopefully with travel restrictions reducing uh to be able to take you to Ernest Henry, uh take you to Red Lake uh and uh and also visit Cal where there are lots have changes happening because seeing is really believing. So thanks. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disc.onnect"

      "baseline" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Pointset Holdings Limited Q2 FY 2022 Appendix 4C Investor presentation. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sam Wanel, Group CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining the Pointsbirth Holding Limited second quarter financial year 2022 Business Update and Activities Report. This is Group CEO Sam Swannel, and I'm joined on the call today by our Group CFO Andrew Mellor, our US CEO Johnny Aitken in Denver and our Group Chief Operating Officer Mark Hughes, who is joining us from Dublin. But before we begin, please note all numbers referred to are unaudited and in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated. Turning to slide three. The December two thousand twenty one quarter, as well as the month of January, has been a period of great progress for Point Spit. During the quarter, we saw improvement in relation to many of our core financial metrics, and we've also made great strides in terms of expanding our addressable market and delivering on our product vision. This has been headlined by an exciting launch into New York this week. New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States and we were very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators to gain access. This is in addition to our launch in Virginia last month and will be followed by our launch into Pennsylvania in February. These are obviously very substantial markets and allow PointSpet to leverage key NBC regional sports network assets in each market. We also this week launched iGaming in West Virginia. We will continue to grow our total addressable market rapidly, with Ontario, Canada likely to follow Pennsylvania, and at least a further seven states are expected to be added in North America in calendar year 2022. In November, we were thrilled to deliver our first major in-play product upgrade following the acquisition of Bannock Technologies, now known as Points Bet Europe. Sports Betting is the product that is leading the expansion of online betting across the USA. To win market share and deliver success in the US market will require excellence in sports betting product and execution. As sports betting is legalized across the US, we anticipate that 75% of all online bets will be placed in play, that is, once a match has already started. Providing an elite, optimized client experience for in-play betting is beyond the capabilities of most operators who do not have modern in house proprietary technology, combined with advanced models and automated real time trading systems. US sports in particular continues to be poorly serviced in terms of the in-play client experience. PointSpet's superior optimised client experience, in particular around in play, will clearly differentiate us from our opposition. The PointSpet Europe upgrade has now been applied to NFL and recently NBA. Further sports will swiftly follow. The impact on our NFL KPIs has been impressive and provides huge encouragement regarding the path we are on. In play handle is up forty four percent since the upgrade, and group COO Mark Hughes will speak to other impressive positive indicators later in the presentation. It is also worth mentioning that this month Pointsbet became the first operator in the US to offer in-play betting with the zero suspensions or one hundred percent uptime across the core markets of NFL's spread and money line. Most people would be unaware that the majority of operators are operating at just seventy percent of uptime, meaning that when a client attempts to place a bet, the market is suspended 30% of the time. It's not hard to see the difference in player experience between the two outcomes and thus the positive sentiment and ultimately ongoing patronage that will be earned by the superior product experience. In addition to in-play betting, another key product battleground is parlays and, in particular, same-gate parlays. As such, it gives me great pride to announce that this week Points Bet released its Market First NFL and NBA in play or live same game parlay. Points Bet Same Game Parla has proven incredibly popular with our clients, and providing them with the opportunity to place these bets during a game is a further example of how Points Bet is hitting its stride, leveraging the capabilities of our proprietary technology and models. As you'll see in today's numbers, it's also great to see US net win increase 64% quarter on quarter to reflect the improvements we've made across the business. That improvement also includes eye gaming. As is well recognised, Points Bet was late to the US market from an eye gaming perspective. We were not in New Jersey pre-PASPA repeal like many of our competitors, and we took the time to build our own in-house proprietary platform as we set the business up the correct way for long term success. But we're now making swift ground. In November we we released the Evolution Live Casino product set into Michigan and this was completed for New Jersey in January. Our gaming net win was up one hundred and forty five percent quarter on quarter, and with West Virginia having launched this week and Pennsylvania and Ontario upcoming, we will see iGaming revenues continue to climb on the back of our ever-improving product suite. In Australia, the December quarter saw the seamless delivery of record activity across the Spring Carnival. It is imperative that we deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable system that meets the needs of our clients on peak days such as Melbourne Cup Day. On Corfield Cup and Everest Day, Pointsbit Australia processed over 4,000 bets per minute, up 2.5 times on last year. On Melbourne Cup Day, we processed over six hundred and eighty-three thousand bets for the day, setting a new record. This continues Points Bet's impressive record of successfully managing peak days without incident in both Australia and the US. To wrap up my introduction, I want to return to the US. In New Jersey, we've historically operated without the benefits of high gaming revenue and without the benefits of also being live in Pennsylvania. Many clients cross the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania and will not use an app that is not operational in both markets. We have the Philadelphia Regional Sports Network via our relationship as the official sports betting partner of NBC. This delivers us integration exclusivity for all Seventy Sixers, Phillies, and Flyers games, an extremely powerful asset. We've been utilizing this asset to reach the South Jersey audience, but will shortly be able to unlock its full benefits by being live in Pennsylvania. Following our New York launch earlier this week, we are now amongst an exclusive group of operators that will be live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. In New York, we are again leveraging our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SNY is the regional broadcast home of Major League Baseball's New York Mets. In addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the NFL's New York Jets, they offer points bet year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities. In parallel with these exciting developments, PointSpec continues to deliver on its product vision. Recent months provide a taste of what is to come with market-leading innovation as we now leverage the hard work that has gone into building our proprietary technology and product. While it is disappointing to see the recent performance at our share price, we continue to focus on achieving our key operational priorities, investing in our proprietary best-in-class technology, and working towards our long-term growth goals. We will now drill into particular focus areas. Slide four. Compared to the group results for Q two FY two thousand twenty-one to be referred to as the PCP in Q2 FY twenty two, sports birding turnover was up eleven per cent at one point three three billion dollars. Our sports betting gross win was up sixty per cent at $133.8 million, and sports betting group net win was up sixty one per cent at seventy one point nine million dollars. Q two FY twenty two iGaming net win of five point four million represented a hundred and forty five percent increase quarter on quarter. Now turning to slide five. The Australian trading business continued its strong performance, ending the quarter with turnover of $727 million, up thirty-four per cent compared to the PCP, and net win of fifty-three point one million, up seven per cent from the PCP. However, net win was marginally lower than Q one FY twenty two, reflecting the business's focus on promotional activity during the Spring Carnival. Gross win margin and net win margin were twelve point seven percent and seven point three percent respectively. Now turning to slide six. The Australian trading business's Q two marketing expense was twenty two point six million dollars, which assisted in delivering twelve month rolling cash active clients to thirty one December of 232,875, an increase of 63% compared to the PCP. To take advantage of the latter parts of the NRL and AFL seasons and the spring racing carnival, the FY twenty two marketing budget was skewed towards H1 to build our brand and to acquire and retain clients over this important period of the sporting and racing calendar. Marketing expense in H2 will be substantially lower than H one as we execute this strategy to front end marketing expense this financial year and leverage our fantastic shack assets. Now turning to slide seven. Compared to the PCP, the Australian trading business has been in suit has seen improvement across several KPIs. We saw a 15% growth of first-time betters. This was particularly pleasing given 2020 saw both AFL and NRL finals shift from September to October, resulting in increased first-time better activity in the PCP. Pointsbed's app download volume grew by 121.3% compared to the PCP, representing the largest gain across all major competitors. Full context, Sportsbed increased volume by thirty four point five percent and Tab by thirty three point nine percent, respectively, compared to the PCP. And Pointsbed's brand awareness grew significantly. As mentioned earlier, I'm also very pleased to report that our in-house proprietary system successfully processed record betting activity through the spring racing carnival. We saw new peaks reached for scale indicators such as bets per minute, concurrent active user sessions, and settlements. Success on such big days in Australia provides the global team with even more confidence in the stability and scalability of our tech stack and trading systems as we enter into the NFL finals and launch in y more US states. I will now hand over to US CEO Johnny Aitken to provide commentary on our US business. Thank you, Sam. Turning to slide eight. In leading off, I wanted to say that we are pleased with the trade during the quarter. As communicated in january two thousand twenty one, the December two thousand twenty quarter for handle, gross win and net win results was impacted by short term by trading variances, which reversed in January of two thousand twenty one, and as such the PCP comparison growth rate should be viewed with this in mind. Pleasingly, Q two net win of twenty four point one million have represented quarter on quarter growth of sixty four percent. We remain focused on generating net win in our US business and doing so in a sustainable and disciplined fashion. Please refer to Appendix one of the presentation for a state by state breakdown of handle gross, win, and net wins. Handle for the quarter was five hundred and ninety-eight point nine million, up seventy-two percent quarter on quarter. Handle shows a decline on PCP, but please know my earlier comments on the impact of last year's short term trading variances. I'd like to take a moment here to outline a very important part of our strategy. We are extremely focused on ensuring that every dollar of handle we book will ultimately drive value and revenue. In line with this, our focus is aimed at ensuring every client we acquire is capable of being revenue generating. Rather than focusing on the sheer number of actives, our experienced customer intelligence and trading analytics teams are intensely focused on calculating the lifetime value of our clients, ensuring they are accurately and quickly profiled, targeting, procuring, and retaining the right clients continues to be very important. Point Spet's blended US online handle market share in the states we are we are operational in, consolidated, was four point two percent for the quarter, compared to four point five percent in Q one of FY twenty two. A further breakdown of market share for estate can be found on slide eight. Lost handle is one indicator of business scale. We remain focused on growing network. Our strong sense is that analysts and operators agree that the market will transition from from being heavily promotional driven to one where the product experience is the primary driver of operator success, combined with scale by distribution, and we certainly have the latter via our partnership with MBC. I note the heightened gross win margin that Pointsbit has delivered in New Jersey compared to all other states. This is partly due to variance, but is also being driven by the more advanced life cycle of the New Jersey market, as customers adopt more diverse products such as parlays and player props, away from the traditional lower pre-game margin spreads, totals, and moneyline bets. This is an encouraging forward looking trend that plays to Points Beth's innovation strengths, controlled by our proprietary tech and internal trading models. Our quick parlay builder, parlay booster, same game parlay, and now in-game same game parlay are just the beginning of ongoing product feature enhancements. Now turning to slide nine. U2 marketing expenses were 29.7 million US dollars, and I'm pleased to report that the overall US working media cost per per F was again under $500. We continue to invest in marketing and growing the brand across the US. Cash Actives grew to two hundred and eleven thousand, up two hundred and ten percent compared to the PCP. It should be noted that this metric also reflects our retention efforts, not just acquisition volumes. Further, a sizeable portion of this quarter's marketing investment was into audiences outside of what were eight live states. This investment targeted upcoming states like Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania, and more broadly acts to build brand awareness in the database nationally to assist future state launches. We noted in the FY twenty two Q one call that there was an opportunity to better utilize our Watactical promotions. A number of optimizations were made during Q two, refining our approach with a focus on rewarding our high value engaged client cohort and gaining an improved share of wallet from them. We reinvested a smaller proportion of gross gaming revenue on promotions in Q two compared to Q one. While slightly lower than the peak seen in September and October, competition remained significant in the quarter, specifically as it related to promotional activity. Thus, it was important to retain and incentivize our valued clients with all four the major pro sports together being active along with college basketball and college football. However, it should be noted that we expect to gradually bring down the rate of promotional investment further in time as we continue to focus and lead with our superior products. Turning to slide eleven, we are excited by the opportunity before us this calendar year as we target to be operational at least seventeen states in the US and also Ontario, Canada, our calendar year end. Our mid December launch of online sports betting operations in Virginia with our partner Colonial Downs marked the eighth operational states for points Bet, and one of our most successful state launches to date when looking at FTBs driven from MBC properties. Virginia represents a large market opportunity with a population of eight point five million, a comparable size to New Jersey and with a rich sports history. Capping over twenty-two thousand leads at launch, largely driven by our partnership with NBC and leveraging local legend, an eleven time NBA All Star uh Alan Iverson, appointed brand ambassador, our Virginia launch exceeded our execution goals. In the first week of launch, Virginia FTBs acquired by NBC channels were almost five times higher than F T Bs acquired in the first week post launch in the state of Michigan. This launch demonstrated that we continue to improve our strategic go to market plans that are leveraging our MBC partnership and execution capabilities. Viewers have been familiar with the Points Beth brand through our exclusive odds integrations and expert expert analysis during key NBC television broadcasts, including Sunday Night Football, where Points Bet brand ambassadors and NBC NFL talent Drew Brees and Chris Sims host the Points Bet Pulse segment with an audience of nearly twenty million people each week. Notably, NBC's Washington Regional Sports Network Affiliate is prominent throughout the region, including Maryland's, an upcoming launch date for 2022, and serves as the exclusive regional broadcast home of the NBA's Washington Wizards and the NHL Washington Capitals. They're utilizing NBC's regional sports networks and owned and operated broadcast stations, unlocks a a daily presence with local market teams and top sporting events, creating a f familiarity with the points of brand prior to launch. In December, we were named the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the University of Maryland Athletics. This multi year agreement marks the first ever sportsbetting partnership within the storied Big Ten Conference and follows our deal with the University of Colorado, which has provided a template to work within the the university space. The University of Maryland Athletics boasts more than three million fans worldwide, with nearly two hundred thousand located in the DMV region, which stands for Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. Also is announced on the twenty fifth of january two thousand twenty two, Point Bet launched operations in New York by representing another major milestone for our company, our brand and our technology. As Sam mentioned earlier, New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States, and we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators in the Big Apple. We will again look to leverage our NBC partnership through Sportsnet MY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SMY is the the regional broadcast home of the Major League Baseball's New York Mets, in addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the New York Jets. They offer points out with year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities across its unmatched portfolio of events. PointSpet will have additional leverage opportunities as one of only six uh operators that have a New York access and official NFL partnership status. As we plan for Pennsylvania to launch next month, our focus will be on the significant Philadelphia and Pittsburgh markets. Since going live in New Jersey in 2019, we have been utilizing NBC Sports Philadelphia to reach the the South Jersey audience. This includes linear inventory and integration across the Flyers, the Seventy-sixers and the Phillies, which taps into their hometown affection to their teams with both with uh digital both on their national sites, geo-targeted ads in New Jersey, and utilizing MBC Sports dot com's RSN specific website. As made public by the New York State Gaming Commission on the thirteenth of August 2021, points bet as an appr approved platform provider. We'll also provide the resorts world, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Genting Group, with a B to B mobile sports wagering uh service in the our state of New York. This strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an a creative and valuable partnership for the company, but not but not uh indicative of a larger B2B strategy of Points Bet. Aside from the unique economic opportunity presented by Resorts World Better New York, Points Bet remains solely focused on our B2C sportsbook and our gaming operations. Turning to slide twelve. Industry analysts keep increasing the estimated size of the US online sports betting gross gaming revenue TAM opportunity. As we launched new states in two by two thousand and twenty two, a coverage of the US population, and with that our TAM our TAM opportunity continues to grow what uh considerably. We've seen some estimates point to an online sports spending TAM and maturity of US about EU forty two billion and on top of that the US eighteen billion for uh for our gaming. We would note that horse racing is not not commonly included in these the US TAM estimates. However, from our our our experiences in Australia, we do think there is future upside in this category to be realised in the US. Hence why we bought Bet Bet PTC, a US advanced deposit horse horse wager in business last year. With the recent launch in New York, the nine states Points bed is currently live in represents a total target population of sixty two million people with an approximate sportsbook tan of ten and a half billion US dollars at maturity. Adding in near term launches of Pennsylvania, Ontario, Louisiana, Tennessee, Maryland, and Ohio represents a further target population of forty six million, an additional six point eight per billion sportsbook TAM opportunity. Turning to slide thirteen. The NBC and Points Bear Partnership entered its second year at the start of September 2021, and the partnership continued to draw continues to drive results and break new ground in the category. It should be noted that at the end of the quarter, only sixteen point five percent of the total NBC lead base was a direct first time better opportunity for points bet. However, that number will jump to an approximate about twenty six percent come February two thousand twenty two, once both New York and Pennsylvania are launched and grow even higher over the calendar year. I'm pleased with how the partnership is developing and excited for the innovation we have planned in H two. The coming period will include a a more robust uh uh a more robust sort of digital plan, incorporating MBC's new Y Regional Connected TV and over the top plus solutions spot on. There are also additional opportunities for inclusion on their quickly growing streaming platform, PCOP. This combination of national and regional networks along with the local the local TV assets gives us the ability to create bespoke bespoke strategies to reach any audience. I'd like to now introduce our group chief Operating Officer Mark Hughes, formerly the CEO of Bannock Technology. Mark began his career working for Patty Power, now part now part of the now part of the Flutter Group, I should say. As a pivotal member of the quantitative analytics team. As previously noted, in play betting is estimated to make up at least seventy five percent in DAUS of all sports wagering activity go within the next three years, and Points Bed acquired banned technology to take advantage of this in play opportunity. Mark will highlight the progress we've made in this area again over the quarter, uh integrating the Bannock trading platform. Over to you Mark. Thank you, Johnny. Now turning to slide fourteen. Implay is our North Star. We believe in the value that sports betting brings in enhancing the viewing experience of a sporting event. And we are building a product to appeal to the user that enjoys that experience. We are on the journey to building an all with on experience that drives customer engagement and repeats usage, meaning more player days, more engagement for player days, and ultimately a higher delivery of utility to the customer. Our data shows that in play delivers the product experience to keep the user engaged and on app during a session, our in-play customers demonstrate a higher average bet size, they bet more frequently, they have more bets per play day, and ultimately a higher average revenue per user. Turning to slide 15. The launch of our enhanced in house in pay model for NFL in October 2021 represented a big milestone for the company. Points that acquired Bannock Technology in early 2021 with the intent to accelerate ambitions to deliver a world-class in-play betting experience to our customers in the US. Bannock Technology was founded with the vision to build a modern sports betting technology platform to support the delivery of a more enriched and quality betting experience for the INPLE customer C US. Since launching the new INPLE NFL model, we have already seen key results when compared to the period immediately prior to release. Firstly, the improved betting experience. The new algorithm has reduced the amount of time our in play product is suspended for betting by more than forty percent. This results in a significant increase in the volume of opportunities our customer has to place a bet. This, coupled with improved bet placement journeys, has led to a reduction of approximately 50% in bets rejected. Secondly, product expansion. We have increased fourfold the number of betting markets our players can bet on. This includes the addition of player prop betting markets and the market first in play same game parlay. We also need our customers to show an appetite to engage with this new content, and the early statistics have showed huge promise with our proportion of turnover outside the three core betting markets increasing by forty-two percent. Our users want to play this product and we'll continue to deliver for them. This also offers a proportional increase in cash out opportunities for our customers. And thirdly, results. Our stated North Star is in play, and our hypothesis is that a product improvements will drive our users to better in-play. Since the launch of our NFL model, in play is a proportion of overall NFL handles has grown by forty four percent. We're continuing to push the boundaries of the customer experience, and with the integration of the official NFL data from BetGenius, we have seen further improvements in both in play betting availability and bet delays. January has seen the introduction of our in house in play MBA product and we will plan a fast follow up for our in house in play NCAAB model and an overall improvement in our in play tennis offering with the introduction of IGF tennis. We're forecasting similar improvements on other in house products and continued momentum towards our vision to deliver a world-class in-play betting experience to our customers. Evidencing our progress during NBC's playoff game on Saturday, fifteenth of January, between the Raiders and the Bengals wildcard, we are proud to have become the first US sports betting provider to offer clients live in game betting opportunities with zero suspensions across the core markets of spread and money line. All of the aforementioned initiatives demonstrate our ability to continue to innovate and lead the market with unique and value adding products. Turning to slide sixteen, I would now like to touch upon iGaming. The iGaming product continues to show strong quota on quota improvement with net win up one hundred and forty five percent. We were particularly excited to have launched our live dealer table solution in Michigan in November and New Jersey in December, including Blackjack, Roulette and Baccarat. The introduction of live dealer gaming is a welcome addition to Pointsbet's growing wagering product suite. Our live gaming options in Michigan offer top-tier choices for our players and will serve as a template as iGaming expands in other jurisdictions in the US and Canada. We launched iGaming in West Virginia on January twenty seventh, and anticipate further launches in Pennsylvania and Ontario in the coming months. Importantly, we look forward to the continued product improvements we have in development as we move to the next phase of our iGaming offering, including a significantly enhanced games library, automated promotional functionality, personalized offerings and other innovations. We will continue to see online casino in customer activity and revenue generation over the coming months. And now I'd like to hand it over to our group CFO, Andrew Meller. Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide seventeen for the quarterly force City cash flow summary. As of the 31st of December 21, the company's corporate cash balance was $523.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter ending 31 December, excluding the movement in player cash accounts, was fifty-six million dollars. I'll now walk through each of the main line items. Receipts from customers for the quarter totaled ninety point four million dollars. This includes net win from sportsbook and iGaming verticals of seventy-seven point three million dollars as previously presented by Sam and Johnny. And the balance of thirteen point one million dollars includes cash receipts from our European B2B operations, cash receipts from our US racing ADW business, and a partial New York licence fee reimbursement received from Resorts World Bet, a subsidiary of the Genting Group, as part of our B2B platform provider agreement to power the Resorts World Bets online sportsbook operation in New York State. As earlier presented by Johnny, this strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an accretive and valuable partnership for the company, but not indicative of a larger B2B strategy of PointsPat. Cash outflows during the quarter included cost of sales of forty four point eight million dollars, which grew on the previous quarter in line with increased trading activity in both the US and Australia. Non capitalised staff costs of eighteen point nine million dollars, with growing global FTEs growing to five hundred thirty and nine at the end of Q two as we continue to build to scale, and in addition we have support staff which are engaged by third party service companies. Marketing cash outflow for the quarter was sixty five point six million. This increased quarter on quarter with slightly increased marketing expenses, as well as being due to the movement in prepayments and accruals from the prior quarter. As previously disclosed, the Australian marketing expense was twenty two point six million Australian dollars for the quarter, and the US marketing expense was twenty nine point seven million US dollars for the quarter. As noted by Sam, the Australian marketing expense will reduce significantly in H two versus H1, and we expect the U.S. marketing expense in Q3 to be higher than Q2 as we launch new US states, including the recent launch in New York and soon to be followed by Pennsylvania, our tenth US state of operation. Cash outflows of administration corporate costs and GST paid on Australian net win was $17 million doll forars the quarter. Turning to investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ending of 31 December was forty three point six million Australian dollars. The main driver of this outflow was the well documented market access payment to the New York State Gaming Commission of 25 million US dollars required to receive our New York State mobile wagering licence. Further over the quarter, the company capitalised 7 million dollars of technology and product staff wages as part of continued development of our sports wagering and iGaming platform. There was minimal cash flows from financing activities for the period and the company has no corporate borrowings. At the end of December we had $523 million in corporate cash. We take a disciplined approach to setting up the company for long-term success, investing in our unique and market leading proprietary technology and product platform, continuing to grow the team to scale across the globe and investing in our marketing strategy. I'll now hand back to Sam. Thanks Andy. Turning to slide 18 and in closing some brief words on Canada. We eagerly await the announcement of an official launch date for Ontario, which is imminent. I could not be more pleased with what has been achieved by our team led by Canadian CEO Scott Vanderwell. We are dedicated to delivering a brand and an experience that is genuinely Canadian. The deals that we have executed with DailyFairsoft.com and the Nation Network, Curling Canada, the National Hockey League Alumni Association, and the Trailer Park Boys are all true to this strategy. We are extremely confident in the efficiency of the cut through these partnerships will deliver to grow brand recognition and acquire clients. In launching Pointsback Canada into Ontario, the Canadian team will leverage not only the proprietary technology and market leading product that the company has built, but also the global scale we now possess with a one team approach supported by staff in numerous continents. Thanks for your time and we'll now take questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star to. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Your first question comes from Rohan Syndr fromome MST. Financial Please go ahead. Hi team. Uh might start with a question for Sam. Just how are you thinking about the long term share aspirations of the business in light of the ongoing increases in estimated North America TAM. So would you be happy with say a five percent share of a a seventy billion dollar market as opposed to say ten percent of a thirty billion dollar market? Is that how you're thinking about it? I get Iran. No, I think look our our aspiration remains to to work towards that ten percent market share. I think the reality is is what we thought, you know, in terms of a marketing budget that would allow us to achieve that um is now effectively probably a marketing budget that's more akin to achieving a say a three or four percent market share. Because as you've sort of drawn the link to the the size of the market has grown dramatically and and the size, the estimated size of the future market so our competitors are being far more aggressive in line with that and they're being far more aggressive from a promotional perspective. So, you know, I suppose our relative budget, if you think about us spending you know twenty seven last quarter and a little bit more this quarter, the market was probably spending close to a billion dollars those two quarters on marketing. So we're probably spending about three percent of what the market's spending for marketing. So it's a bit unrealistic for us to expect at this stage in the current environment to be to be heading, you know, rapidly north towards that ten percent. But as you know, I suppose as we assume the market transitions, you know, it was interestinging hear Adam um the CEO of MGM, bet MGM yesterday or the day before, talk about maybe there's another twelve months of um you know this heightened aggressiveness in the market, maybe one more start of NFL season, but then their expectation is that perhaps things ease off a little bit. Um and we probably we probably agree with that. And in line with that, you know, obviously we're continuing to make rapid progress on our product strategy. So we think those two things combined, improving our brand, we're investing in our brand, we're investing in building databases. While it may take longer to get to that ten percent, given the the growing TAM and the and the amount that's being spent, you know, we still plan to get there as the market transitions to being more product focused. Okay. Thanks. And and on the New Jersey share, I know it's not the the main game but I take into account the the reduction there in turnover. But given the high net win, how would you share look on a a net win basis, especially given the first quarter was almost eight percent net win? Yeah, well I mean that New Jersey's a very good example. So you know from a market share perspective we came under a bit of pressure again but that from a net win perspective, net win quarter on quarter was up twenty four percent. You know, so that's that's a good example. We want to keep growing growing net win. Now if that's a smaller por portion of the market than we thought would be, that's in some ways a positive because again it talks to the fact that the market is bigger than most expected and and is growing more rapidly. Um Johnny made a comment during um his part about the fact that you know New Jo Jersey now it's becoming a bit of a trend that it's gross margin yields are yielding higher than our other states. And you know we look we look at the reasons behind that. And as he said, some of it's some variance, but but some of it is definitely some differences in player behaviour in terms of that slightly more mature market now because it's been open a bit longer, players gravitating to the higher margin products, the same game parlays, the player props, etcetera. And we think again that's a positive trend for us because it shows that they're moving into the let's call it the sweet spot for point step because this is where we aim to lead in terms of having the most engaging um product set. Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Stout from S I G. Please go ahead. Uh good morning everyone. Um you know you Sam, you talked about New Jersey, you know, Indiana and Michigan were, you know, the states the bigger states that you have exposure to in the third quarter where you lost share, but um I guess the expectation, rightfully, wrongfully, is it would take a while to build those back given the advertising and the promotional uh environment. But you're able to rebuild in Michigan and I was wondering, can you describe or talk about, you know, maybe some of the methods that you use to to recapture some of that lost share in the fourth quarter ver I'm sorry, in the um fiscal second quarter versus the first quarter? That's the first question. And then I wanted um to ask about customer acquisition costs. Um Johnny you had mentioned you you guys are still uh running about five hundred dollars or so. And with your newer launch states in Virginia and Pennsylvania in a month or you know in February and and New York and your ability to rely on your RSNs, your NBC RSNs, would it be fair to assume that that customer acquisition costs could come down in those particular markets? Yeah, hi Joe. Um so in terms of Michigan, look again, I think the pleasing thing for Michigan, yes, our sports betting market share did go up, but again, even more importantly, you I think we had seven hundred thousand of net win last quarter and this quarter was something like three point two million. So again, really good growth in Michigan from a net a net win perspective. Um you know I think obviously when you've got the casino products improving, uh you know, when we when we think about states that have a mix of sports betting and i gaming, you really do have to look at them in in in totality because it goes without saying that if a client um goes and loses some money playing blackjack, well then that's perhaps less money than they have to turn over on sports betting. So the two are are generally related and thus when you're looking at New Jersey, uh Michigan and and soon to be West Virginia and Pennsylvania and states with with mix, you have to look at the combined result um not you know, with there there's a difference with you just have sports betting to to having sports betting uh and eye gaming. Johnny, is there anything you'd want to say about um Michigan in particular? I'll just add Sam that e again we view every state as a state as its own uh country and and each state sort of differs in terms of the dynamics and how again consumers consume sport, the population by distribution. You know, a market like Michigan is very unique and and in particular, you know, we're seeing I guess the early results of our a very smart investment with um a uh Olympia Entertainment. So they um own theed arena where the Pistons and the Red Wings play. We made a smart investment into building a sports bar next to the main entrance of the stadium and when you've got at least eighty two home games of MBA NHL and people are walking past the Points Fifth brand going in and out of the arena and going there and having a drink. It's played a role in making sure the Points Bet's part of the local sporting fabric there and part of the consideration when people in Michigan and Detroit are thinking about where to place their next bet or sign up. Thanks, Johnny. Yeah. In terms of the CAC Joe, I mean yeah, we spent and we and Johnny made a comment about this, we spent twenty s twenty nine point seven million on marketing and last quarter was similar in terms of um because we were waiting to launch in vet in in Virginia and we knew that we had upcoming launches and we were waiting but but you know quietly confident of a positive outcome in New York and again a confident of a positive outcome with licensing in Pennsylvania. It's been a strange couple of quarters because a a fair chunk of our marketing budget has gone into the Washington R and C N the the Philly R S N and and S N Y New York. So as those states go live, Virginia, now New York and and soon Pennsylvania, you know, that that spend goes from being sort of out of state to to being in live states. And so that proportion of let's call it somewhat of spend that was going outside and maybe less efficient. Yes, it was building the brand and and warming those states up. That then comes in state. So I don't necessarily I wouldn't necessarily say that CACs are going to come down because we're now um going um you know live into those states. But we certain certainly do believe that those it's it's the the model that we've used obviously in in Chicago that um yeah we're never gonna outspend these big guys at the moment but you know the audience watches live sport, you know we've got Phil Lee's seventy sixes, all the teams that Johnny spoke about, the Mets in in in New York, etc., um getting in front of those eyeballs through those RSNs. Thank you. The next question comes from Desmond Sau from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Um I've just got a couple of questions around slide uh fourteen and fifteen. I think you guys provided some interesting detail uh on those two slides. Um, you know, obviously I think Mark noted a couple of industry first achievements by the business in the US and obviously now with Bannek and the rise of in play. I was wondering if you can just talk a bit more about the opportunity that in play presents and then more specifically whether you have a sense of market share within in play. You know, would it be fair to say that your share of the in play market is actually far greater than the blended four point two percent share that you talked to today? Yeah good question. Um yeah I think in terms of the opportunity, you know I want I really want this to be clear in terms of stepping through the dynamics of the US market. Um you know we've we've been at at a disadvantage because we didn't come from an eye gaming background. Most of the companies that we're competing against New Jersey legalized eye gaming back in something like 2013. So all of most of our competitors have been operating eye gaming in America in one state at least and maturing all of their products and practices for some time, you know, pre-PASPA being repealed. Um add to that, as I said, the fact that we took the time to build our own platform because we want it, we want to own it, we want to keep the margin for the long term. You know, we have been at a competitive disadvantage from a product set perspective, but also from a revenue perspective of of not having had um having had that product. But as we think about, you know, forward looking states, you know, I think it i needs to be clear that all the states that are going live now and launching are all sports betting only. So high gaming expertise is not going to necessarily get you get you anywhere if you don't have sports betting expertise. And our obviously our blueprint is to win our market share on the back of our sports bidding expertise and then when i gaming does get legalised, you know, two years later or three years later for a particular state, we've already got um hundreds of thousands of clients and we can cross sell forty percent of them, whatever that number is, to IGaming, versus you know, someone who was focused on I gaming, well, they won't have any market share. Um if they don't have Petroclear Sports Bedding product, um they're they're not going to win that market share in those sports betting states. But within you know that earning of market share from sports betting, I don't think there's there's any operators out there that aren't talking about a seventy five percent in play uh market. Uh so so everyone's everyone's agreeing that seventy five percent of sports bets will be placed in play and you know we're on a path to we believe leading um within that sector. Now we want to lead within the entire product sector. So we want to have the best product full stop and that includes you know improving our gaming product. Um but you know leading the way and now starting to deliver on um some of our product vision. Part of the challenge when you build something from scratch, you know, we built we've built this tech stack from scratch, even in Australia and you know, at at the start with not a lot of resources, is it takes time to d to deliver things. Um and we've now getting to the point where um you know we've we're delivering, you know, we're starting to innovate as you know a hundred percent uptime in, play in play same game parlay, etcetera. So when it comes to, you know, the in play vision and how important it's going to be for winning market share and ultimately succeeding in the US, I don't think anyone's in in in doubt with that. And and I hope you know um the market is starting to see how points bet um is already leading in this category but he's gonna put the foot down and continue to um you know to really um put a gap on there. Um in terms of market share, in play market share. I'll throw it I'll throw to Johnny, but I would just say perhaps, you know, I I think it's still a customer journey, and that's what we were talking about from the from the New Jersey perspective. That, you know the market is still very focused on the promos, etc. It'll it'll gradually gravitate to being more product focused. And then there's the second part to that is though as clients get a little bit more sophisticated as we're seeing in New Jersey and they branch away from the core bet types into, you know, uh more creative bet types and higher margin uh bet types. But Johnny, do you have a feel for whether you believe we're already over indexing from an in play perspective? Yeah Sam, I think I I think the true sort of read through will be um sort of sort of Q three and onwards this quarter and onwards. And the reason being there that yeah again in Q two we we saw NFL and NBA move on to our our uh internal trading feeds powered by uh the banner technology. And so now sort of for each quarter ahead we'll get a true read of of the power that drives. You know, one of the things I think is misunderstood by um the market is that it isn't just about competing for in play on the number of markets you have. Um, it isn't just about building player props and micro markets. Really the core tenant of offering an in play experience that drives repeat uh usage and allows you to lean in on on your product over sort of again sort of covering uh maybe with gaps in your product with heavier sort of promotions. Centers around being up are the longest. Again, you know, sort of aiming towards that zero sort of betting suspensions and giving consumers that complete experience to place a bet, to cash out their bet, uh without again um you know, the moment when the markets are sus are suspended. And then the second tenant is around the speed to accept the bet. Again, you know, we sort of know that our competition in general applies seven to ten second bet delay um when any in play bet is placed. And then after that seven and ten seconds passes and the bet is then um pinged again to the trading uh software that's being used externally by a lot of our competitors, fifty percent of the time the bet's being uh rejected due to a price change or again uh due to the market being suspended. Again, you know, we're uh again actively working and sort of backing in the models um that have been delivered by Bannock, sort of backing in again the pricing efficiency that we have, that we have the confidence to continu to uh continue to put as many clients as we can on zero bet delay. And so not only matching again, as I said, that that sort of um you know sort of uptime goal to again continue to increase that, but also accepting bets um, you know, in sort of lightning speed. And if we're up the longest and quickest to accept, we think that combined with our product features and then the again distribution of the message of Points Bet being uh the king of in play, particularly across C M B C platforms, again is gonna be a huge ongoing driver of client activity for the business. Great. Thanks Sam. Thanks Johnny. Appreciate it. That's all for me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Gandler from Credit Swiss. Please go ahead. I think uh a few questions for me. Um Sam just in New Jersey, uh I you know, hearing how you guys evolved um, you know, the management of that uh offering there. Um can you talk to whether that involved a churn of customers or is it did you migrate existing customers into new patterns? Um how that'd play out? And is this a sort of first state? How come you didn't sort of take this approach in Illinois yet? Is it just a different s circumstance there? Okay, Larry. Um yeah, I think across the across the business, you know, we made a comment and I think Johnny referenced it again that last quarter we probably didn't focus enough on our existing clients or our higher quality clients and um with our with our promotions and focused on you know the acquisition period and I think you know we we we do want to focus on quality clients uh without wanting to yeah everyone's got their own strategies but you know there's a acquiring clients um is not hard. You know we c we can run promotions and um give away money and just acquire clients, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of those clients are going to be of of value. So we're trying to find the the balance um and I think that's the message you know coming out that yes, um we we'll keep growing, but we want to keep growing um responsibly. Um so if you know adding another ten thousand actives or twenty thousand actives if those actives are are no good and that then that's the same in terms of churn, there's no point trying to hold on to some clients if they're just they're just genuinely not not genuine. Um then then you know we make we make no uh apologies for for doing that. So no I wouldn't I wouldn't sort of say that we're actively um you know targeting um segments or you know disconnecting from certain segments apart from unprofitable segments. You know clients that are just not going to be worth anything. Uh and in terms of Illinois, no, it's it's very similar. Um it's it's it's very similar, the strategy's the same. Yeah, it's about it's about a focus on value, continuing to grow. It's just the dynamics work out that in in New Jersey we grew revenue by that twenty four percent um quarter on quarter, lost a bit of market share. Um in Illinois we're able to continue growth without losing that market share, but the s the strategy is consistent. Okay, excellent there. And um with New Jersey, just continuing on that, um I think it did about fifteen million of net win in the half. Let's say we annualize that and a bit more. New Jersey's been funding um marketing for new states, but if we kinda withdraw that new state support, um are we getting it close to break even in New Jersey alone if you sort of isolate just New Jersey marketing? Yeah, I think I think we are, uh Larry. Yeah, I mean I think would we do ten point eight for the quarter, I would rather times that by four, um, because the eye gaming product has come in and that wasn't necessarily um present in in in previous quarters. You know, there's a few there's a lot happening in New Jersey. There's a lot of market dynamics still there, so I'll I'll call out a few. You know, obviously going live in New York and being um one of an exclusive group that will be live in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will be helpful going live in Pennsylvania. We spoke to that that Philly audience. The continued growth of the eye gaming products um is going to be vitally important. But, you know I, think um I think by the middle of next year, um, you know, we think New Jersey s is turning profitable. So um, you know, post the the PESPA cessation of sports, you know, sport came back middle of post COVID in the middle of two thousand twenty, sort of had to restart the business. And so, you know, we think by the end of next financial year we're we're turning profitable. Okay, agree. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Don Carducci from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Morning everyone. So just a couple quick ones from me. So if I think about the net new active customers, where did they they come from? Uh was it the new markets or was it maybe those markets that you had been in for twelve months or more? Hi Don. Yeah, I mean look obviously we acquire clients in all in all new markets. The difference being that in a market like New Jersey where you have been uh live for some time you also churn clients out out the back end. So the increase in active clients is a is a net effect. It's what you've added, obviously the increase we've acquired more first time betters than that increase in actives, but we've also churned some clients in the back end. So that's the that's the net the net effect. Yeah, no, g got it. Uh understand that. So I guess if I rephrase the question, I mean you you have churn. Is the majority of this churn coming from new states, or is it coming from the existing states that you've been in for twelve months or more, like New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana. Yeah, no, by by the definition, because we're giving a twelve month rolling number, it has to be states that we've been live in for more than twelve months. Because if we've been live in six in in um a state for six months, for example, um all of those clients would be in the twelve month active number. Gotcha. And then can you give us a little bit of clarity on the the cash burn guidance maybe for next quarter? Um include you know license payments, eteracet. Obviously Pennsylvania, that's a that's a steep one, uh New Jersey, but just kind of a little bit of guidance on what we should expect for that. Yeah, sure, Don Sandy. You know, I think in just talk to to Cashburn generally, you know, we're continuing to build obviously for the long term and investing in this opportunity, particularly in the US and and the product. And that is requiring a reasonable level of upfront investment. As you mentioned, the the market access requirements, licing requirements, and the marketing investment, which I think it's pretty pretty well understood as we roll out into new states. As it relates to the market access payment. Obviously this was a a large payment that we made in New York, which was twenty five million US in Q two. Um the payment required for Pennsylvania uh is eleven million US dollars which will be which will be paid in Q three. So the business development payments for for Q three will be lower than than Q two. Gotcha. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sam Swanell, Group CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. And thank you all for joining the PointsBet Holdings Limited Second Quarter of Financial Year 2022 Business Update And Activities Report. This is Group CEO, Sam Swanell. And I'm joined on the call today by our Group CFO, Andrew Mellor; our U.S. CEO, Johnny Aitken in Denver; and our Group Chief Operating Officer, Mark Hughes, who is joining us from Dublin. Before we begin, please note all numbers referred to are unaudited and in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated. Turning to slide three. The December 2021 quarter, as well as the month of January, has been a period of great progress for PointsBet. During the quarter, we saw improvement in relation to many of our core financial metrics, and we've also made great strides in terms of expanding our addressable market and delivering on our product vision. This has been headlined by exciting launch into New York this week. New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States, and we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators to gain access. This is in addition to our launch in Virginia last month, and will be followed by our launch into Pennsylvania in February. These are obviously very substantial markets and allow PointsBet to leverage key NBC regional sports network assets in each market. We also, this week launched iGaming in West Virginia. We will continue to grow our total addressable market rapidly with Ontario, Canada likely to follow Pennsylvania. And at least a further seven States are expected to be added in North America in calendar year 2022. In November, we were thrilled to deliver our first major in-play product upgrade following the acquisition of Banach Technology, now known as PointsBet Europe. Sports betting is the product that is leading the expansion of online betting across the U.S.A. To win market share and deliver success in the U.S. market will require excellence in sports betting product and execution. As sports betting is legalized across the U.S. we anticipate that 75% of all online bets will be placed in-play, that is once a match has already started. Providing an elite optimized client experience in-play betting is beyond the capabilities of most operators who do not have modern in-house proprietary technology, combined with advanced models and automated real time trading systems. U.S. sports in particular continues to be poorly serviced in terms of the in-play client experience. PointsBet's superior optimized client experience, in particular around in-play, will clearly differentiate us from our opposition. The PointsBet Europe upgrade has now been applied to NFL and recently NBA. Further sports will swiftly follow. The impact on our NFL KPIs has been impressive and provides huge encouragement regarding the path we are on. In-play handle is up 44% since the upgrade, and Group COO, Mark Hughes, will speak to other impressive positive indicators later in the presentation. It's also worth mentioning that this month, PointsBet became the first operator in the U.S. to offer in-play betting with zero suspensions or 100% uptime across the core markets of NFL's spread and money line. Most people would be unaware that the majority of operators are operating at just 70% of uptime, meaning that when a client attempts to place a bet, the market is suspended 30% of the time. It's not hard to see the difference in player experience between the two outcomes, and thus the positive sentiment and ultimately ongoing patronage that will be earned by the superior product experience. In addition to in-play betting, another key product battleground is parlays, and in particular, same-game parlays. As such, it gives me great pride to announce that this week, PointsBet released its market-first NFL and NBA in-play or live same-game parlay. PointsBet same-game parlay has proven incredibly popular with our clients, and providing them with the opportunity to place these bets during a game, is a further example of how PointsBet is hitting its stride, leveraging the capabilities of our proprietary technology and models. As you see in today's numbers, it's also great to see U.S. net win increase 64% quarter-on-quarter to reflect the improvements we've made across the business. That improvement also includes iGaming. As is well recognized, PointsBet was late to the U.S. market from an iGaming perspective. We were not in New Jersey prepast the repeal like many of our competitors. And we took the time to build our own in-house proprietary platform as we set the business up the correct way for long-term success, but we are now making swift ground. In November we, we released the evolution live casino product set into Michigan, and this was completed for New Jersey in January. iGaming net win was up 145% quarter-on-quarter. And with West Virginia having launched this week, and Pennsylvania and Ontario upcoming, we will see iGaming revenues continue to climb on the back of our ever improving product suite. In Australia, the December quarter saw the seamless delivery of record activity across the spring carnival. It is imperative that we deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable system that meets the needs of our clients on peak days, such as Melbourne Cup Day. On Caulfield Cup and <inaudible> Day, PointsBet Australia processed over 4,000 bets per minute, up 2.5 times on last year. On Melbourne Cup Day, we processed over 683,000 bets for the day, setting a new record. This continues PointsBet's impressive record at successfully managing peak days without incident in both Australia and the U.S. To wrap up my introduction, I wanna return to the U.S. In New Jersey, we've historically operated without the benefits of iGaming revenue, and without the benefits of also being live in Pennsylvania. Many clients cross the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania will not use an app that is not operational in both markets. We have the Philadelphia regional sports network via a relationship as the official sports betting partner of NBC. This delivers us integrations exclusivity for all 76ers, Phillies, and Flyers games an extremely powerful asset. We've been utilizing this asset to reach the South Jersey audience, but we'll shortly be able to unlock its full benefits by being live in Pennsylvania. Following our New York launch earlier this week, we are now amongst an exclusive group of operators that will be live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. In New York, we are again leveraging our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SNY is the regional broadcast home of Major League baseball's, New York Mets, in addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the NFL's New York Jets. They offer PointsBet year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities. In parallel with these exciting developments, PointsBet continues to deliver on its product vision. Recent months provided a taste of what is to come with market leading innovation as we now leverage the hard work that's gone into building our proprietary technology and product. While it is disappointing to see the recent performance of our share price, we continue to focus on achieving our key operational priorities, investing in our proprietary best-in-class technology, and working towards our long-term growth goals. We'll now drill into particular focus areas. Slide four. Pair to the group results for Q2 FY 2021, to be referred to as the PCP, in Q2, FY ' 22, sports betting turnover was up 11% at $1.33 billion, as sports betting gross win was up 60% at $133.8 million, and sports betting group net win was up 61% at $71.9 million, to Q2, FY ' 22, iGaming net win of 5.4 million represented 145% increase quarter-on-quarter. Now turning to slide five. The Australian trading business continued its strong performance ending the quarter with turnover of $727 million up 34% compared to the PCP, and net win of $53.1 million up 7% from the P- PCP. However, net win was marginally lower in Q1, FY ' 22, reflecting the business' focus on promotional activity during the spring carnival. Gross win margin and net win margin were 12.7% and 7.3% respectively. Now turning to slide six. The Australian trading business' Q2 marketing expense was $22.6 million, which assisted in delivering 12 month rolling cash active clients to 31 December of 232,875, an increase of 63% compared to the PCP. To take advantage each of the latter parts of the NRL and AFL seasons, and the spring racing carnival, the FY ' 22 marketing budget was skewed towards H1 to build our brand and to acquire and retain clients over this important period of the sporting and racing calendar. Marketing expense in H2 will be substantially lower than H1 as we execute the strategy to front end marketing expense this financial year and leverage our fantastic shack assets. Now turning to slide seven. Compared to the PCP, Australian trading business has been in suit, has seen improvement across several KPIs. We saw a 15% growth of first time bettors. This was particularly pleasing, given 2020 saw both AFL and NRL finals shift from September to October, resulting in increased first time beter activity in the PCP. PointsBet's app download volume grew by 121.3% compared to the PCP, representing the largest gain across all major competitors. For context, sports betting increased volume by 34.5%, and tab by 33.9% respectively compared of the PCP. And PointsBet's brand awareness grew significantly. As mentioned earlier, I'm also very pleased to report that our in-house proprietary system successfully process rec- record betting activity through the spring racing carnival. We saw new peaks reach for scale indicators such as bets per minute, concurrent active user sessions, and settlements. Success on such big days in Australia provides the global team with even more confidence in the stability and scalability of our tech stack and trading systems as we enter into the NFL finals and launch in more U.S. States. We'll now hand over to U.S. CEO, Johnny Aitken, to provide commentary on our U.S. business. Thank you, Sam. Turning to slide eight. In leading off, I wanted to say that we are pleased with the trade during the quarter. As communicated in January 2021, the December 2020 quarter for handle gross win and net win results was impacted by short-term, by trading variances, which reversed in January of 2021. And as such, the PCP comparison growth rates should be viewed with this in mind. Pleasingly, Q2 net win of 24.1 million have represented quarter-on-quarter growth of 64%. We remain focused on generating net win in our U.S. business, and doing so in a sustainable and disciplined fashion. Please refer to appendix one of the present for State by State breakdown of handle gross win and net wins. Handle for the quarter was 598.9 million up 72% quarter-on-quarter. Handle shows a decline on PCP, but please note my earlier comments on the impact of last year's short-term trading variances. I'd like to take a moment here to outline a very important part of our strategy. We are extremely focused on ensuring that every dollar of handle we book will ultimately drive value and revenue. In line with this, our focus is aimed at ensuring every client we acquire is capable of being about revenue generating. Rather than focusing on the sheer number of actives, our experienced customer intelligence and trading analytics teams are intensely focused on calculating the lifetime value of our clients, ensuring they are accurately and quickly profiled. Targeting, procuring, and retaining the right clients continues to be very important. PointsBet's blended U.S. online handle market share in the States we are, we are operational in consolidated with 4.2% for the quarter, compared to 4.5% in Q1 of FY ' 22. A further breakdown of market share per State can be found on slide eight. Cost handle is one indicator of business scale. We remain focused on growing net win. Our strong sense is that analysts and operators agree that the market will transition fr- from being heavily promotional-driven to one where the product experience is the primary driver of operator success combined with scale of distribution. And we certainly have the latter via our partnership with MBT. I note the heightened gross win margin that PointsBet has delivered in New Jersey compared to all other state. This is partly due to variance, but it's also being driven by the more advanced life cycle of the New Jersey market as customers adopt more diverse products, such as parlays and player props away from the traditional lower pregame margin spreads, totals, and money line bets. This is an encouraging forward looking trend that plays to PointsBet's innovation strengths controlled by our proprietary tech and internal trading models. Our quick, our quick parlay builder, parlay booster, same-game parlay, and now in-game, same-game parlay, are just the beginning of ongoing gut product feature enhancements. Now turning to slide nine. Q2 marketing expenses were 29.7 million USD. And I'm pleased to report that the overall U.S. working media cost per, per FDB was again under $500. We continue to invest in marketing and growing the brand across the U.S. Cash actives grew to 211,000 up 210% compared to the PCP. It should be noted that this metric also reflects our retention efforts, not just ac- not just acquisition volumes. Further, a sizeable portion of this quarter's marketing investment was into audiences outside of what was eight live State. This investment targeted upcoming States like Virginia, New York and Pennsylvania, and more broadly asked to build brand awareness and the database nationally to assist future state launches. We noted in the FY ' 22 Q1 call, that there was an opportunity to better utilize our tactical promotions. A number of optimizations were made during Q2 refining our approach with a focus on rewarding our high value engaged client cohort and gaining an improved share of wallet from them. We have reinvested a smaller proportion of gross gaming revenue on the promotions in Q2 compared to Q1. While slightly lower than the peak seen in September and October, competition remained significant in the quarter, specifically as it related to promotional activity, thus, it was important to retain and incentivize our value c- clients with all four, the major pro sports together being active along with college basketball and college football. However, it should be noted that we expect to gradually bring down the rate of promotional investment further in time as we continue to focus and lead with our superior product. So ending to slide 11. We are excited by the opportunity before us this calendar year, as we target to be operational at least 17 States in the U.S. and also Ontario, Canada, our calendar year-end. Our mid-December launch of online sports betting operations in Virginia with our partner Colonial Downs, mark the eighth operational States for PointsBet, and one of our most successful State launches to date when looking at FTB driven from NBC properties. Virginia represents a large market opportunity with a population of 8.5 million, a comparable size to New Jersey, and with a rich sports history. Tapping over 22,000 leads at launch largely driven by our partnership with NBC and leveraging local legend and 11 time NBA Allstar, Alan Iverson, a PointsBet brand ambassador, our Virginia launch exceeded, uh, our execution goals. In the first week of launch, Virginia FTB acquired by NBC channels were almost five times higher than FTB acquired in the first week post launch in the State of Michigan. This launch demonstrated that we continue to improve our strategic go-to market plans that are leveraging our NBC partnership and execution capabilities. Viewers have been familiar with the PointsBet brands through our exclusive odds integrations and expert, e- expert analysis during key NBC television broadcast, including Sunday Night Football, where PointsBet brand ambassadors and NBC, NFL talent through Breys and Chris Simms, host the PointsBet post segment with an audience of nearly 20 million people each week. Notably, NBC's Washington regional sports and network affiliate is prominent throughout the region, including Maryland, an upcoming launch date for 2022, and serves as the exclusive regional broadcast home of the NBA's, this is Washington Wizards, and the NHL Washington Capitals. They're utilizing NBC's regional sports networks and owned and operated broadcast station unlocks a, a daily presence with local market teams and top sporting events. Grading a f- a familiarity with the PointsBet brand pride on launch. In that December, we were named the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the University of Mary Athletics. This multi-year agreement marks the first ever sports betting partnership within the storied big 10 conference, and follows our deal with the University of Colorado, which has provided the template to work within the, uh, the university space. The University of Maryland athletic spends more than 3 million funds worldwide with nearly 200,000 located in the DMV region, which stands for the Washington D.C, Maryland, and Virginia. Also as announced, on the 25th of January 2022, PointsBet launched operations in New York by representing another major milestone for our company, our brand, and our web technology. As Sam mentioned earlier, New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States. And we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators in the Big Apple. We'll again, look to leverage our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SMY is the, the, the regional broadcast home of the major league baseball, New York Mets. In addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the New York Jets, they offer PointsBet with year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities across its unmatched bet portfolio of events. PointsBet will have additional leverage opportunities as one of only six, uh, operators that have a New York access and official NFL partnership status. As we plan to Pennsylvania to launch next month, our focus will be on the significant, uh, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh markets. Since going live in New Jersey in 2009, we have been utilizing NBC Sports Philadelphia to reach the, the South Jersey audience. This includes linear imagery and integration across the Flyers, the 76ers, and the Phillies, which taps into their hometown affection to their teams with both, with, uh, by digital, both on their national sites, our geo targeted ads to New Jersey and, uh, utilizing nbcsports.com 's RSN specific website. As made public by the New York State Gaming Commission on the 13th of August 2021, PointsBet as an app- approved their platform provider, will also provide the Resort World, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Genting Group, with a B2B by mobile sports, so by wagering a service in the State of New York. This strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an, a creative and valuable partnership for the company, but not, but not, uh, indicative of a large B2B strategy of PointsBet. Aside from the unique economic opportunity got presented by the Resort World Bet of New York, PointsBet remains solely focused on our B2C sports book and our gaming operations. Turning to slide 12. Industry analysts keep increasing the estimated size of the U.S. online sports betting, gross gaming revenue TAM opportunity. As we launched new States in 2- about 2022, our coverage of the U.S. population. And with that, our TAM, our TAM opportunity continues to grow, uh, well considerably. We've seen some estimates point to an online sports spending TAM and maturity of U.S. about 42 billion. And on top of that, the U.S. 18 billion for our, for our gaming. We would note that horse racing is not, not commonly included in these, the U.S. TAM estimates. However, from our, our, our experiences in Australia, we do think there is future upside in this category to be realized in the U.S. hence why we bought Bet, Bet PTC, a U.S. advanced deposit horse, horse, uh, wagering business last year. With the recent launch in New York, the United States PointsBet is currently live and represents a total target population of 62 million people with an approximate sports book TAM of 10 1 \/ 2 billion USD at maturity. Adding in near term launches of Pennsylvania, Ontario, Louisiana, Tennessee, Maryland, and Ohio, represents a further target population of 46 million, an additional 6.8 billion sports book TAM opportunity. Turning to slide 13. The NBC and PointsBet partnership entered its second year at the start of September, 2021. And the partnership continued to dr- continues to drive results and break new ground in the category. It should be noted that at the end of the quarter, only 16.5% of the total NBC lead base was a direct first time bettor opportunity for PointsBet. However, that number will jump to an approximate by 26% from February 2022, once both New York and Pennsylvania are launched and grow even higher over the calendar year. I'm pleased with how the partnership is developing, and excited for the innovation we have planned in H2. The coming period will include a, a more ro- robust, a, a more robust sort of digital plan incorporating NBC's new by regional connected TV and, and over the top bet solution spot on. There are also additional opportunities for inclusion on their quickly growing streaming platform, Peacock. This combination of national and regional networks along with the local, uh, the local TV assets, gives us the ability to create bespoke, bespoke strategies to reach any audience. I'd like to now introduce our Group Chief Operating Officer, Mark Hughes, formally the CEO of Banach Technology. Mark began his career working for Paddy Power, now part, now part of the, now part of the, uh, Flutter Group, I should say, as a pivotal member of the quantitative analytics team. As previously noted, in-play betting is estimated to make up at least 75% in the, uh, U.S. of all sports wagering activity, uh, within the next three years. And PointsBet acquired Banach Technology to take advantage of this in-play opportunity. Mark will highlight the progress we've made in this area, again, over the quarter, uh, uh, integrating the, uh, Banach trading platform. Over to you, Mark. Thank you, Johnny. Now turning to slide 14. In-play is our north star. We believe in the value that sports betting brings in enhancing the viewing experience of a sporting event. And we are building a product to appeal to the users that enjoy that experience. We are on the journey to building an always on experience that drives customer engagement and repeat usage, meaning more player days, more engagement for player day, and ultimately a higher delivery of utility to the customer. Our data shows that in-play delivers the product experience to keep the user engaged and on apps during a session. Our in-play customers demonstrate higher average bet plays to bet more frequently. They have more bets per play day and ultimately a higher average revenue per user. Turning to slide 15. The launch of our enhanced in-house in-play model for NFL in October 2021, represented a big milestone for the company. PointsBet acquired Banach Technology in early 2021, with the intent to accelerate ambitions to deliver a world class in-play betting experience to our customers in the U.S. Banach Technology was founded with the vision to build a modern sports betting technology platform to support the delivery of a more enriched and quality betting experience for the in-play customer in the U.S. Since launching the new in-play NFL model, we have already seen key results when compared to the period immediately prior to release. Firstly, the improved betting experience.New algorithm has reduced the amount of time our in-play product is suspended for betting, by more than 40%. This results in a significant increase in volume of opportunities across time to place a bet. This coupled with improved bet placement journeys have led to a reduction of approximately 50% in bets rejected. Secondly, product expansion. We have increased fourfold, the number of betting markets our players can bet on. This includes the addition of player prop betting markets and the markets first in-play same-game parlay. We also need our customers to show an appetite to engage with this new content. And the early statistics have showed huge promise with a proportion of turnover outside three core betting markets increasing by 42%. Our users want to play this product, and we'll continue to deliver for them. This also offers a proportional increase in cash out opportunities for our customers. And thirdly, results. Our stated north star is in-play, and our hypothesis is that our product improvements will drive our users to better in-play. Since the launch of our NFL model, in-play is a proportion of overall NFL handle has grown by 44%. So continuing to push the boundaries of the customer experience and with integration of the official NFL data from Betgenius, we have seen further improvements in both in-play betting availability and bet delays. January have seen the introduction of our in-house in-play NBA product, and we'll plan a fast follow for our in-house in-play NCAAB model, and an overall improvement in our in-play tennis offering with the introduction of IDF tennis. So forecasting similar improvements on other in-house products and continue to mo- momentum towards our vision to deliver a word class in-play betting experience to our customers. Evidencing our progress during NBC's playoff game on Saturday 15th of January, between the Raiders and the Bengal's Wild Card, we are proud to become the first U.S. sports betting provider to offer clients live in-game betting opportunities with zero suspensions across the core markets of spread and money line. All of the aforementioned initiatives demonstrates our ability to continue to innovate and lead the market with unique and value adding products. Turning to slide 16. I would now like to touch upon iGaming. The iGaming product continues to show strong quarter-on-quarter improvement with net win up 145%. We were particularly excited to have launched our live dealer table solution in Michigan, in November, and New Jersey in December, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. Online casino products have seen a rapid product in the U.S. And the experience iGaming team at PointsBet is responsive to our users and eager to bring our customers the experience and gains they're looking for. The introduction of live theater gaming is a welcome addition to PointsBet's growing wagering product suite. Our live gaming options in Michigan offer top tier choices for our players and will serve as a template as iGaming expands in other jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada. We launched iGaming in West Virginia on January 27th, and anticipate further launches in Pennsylvania and Ontario in the coming months. Importantly, we look forward to the continued product improvements we have in development as we move to the next phase of our iGaming offering, including a significantly enhanced games library, automated promotional functionality, personalized offerings, and other innovations. We will continue to see online casino in customer activity and revenue generation over the coming months. I now I'd like to hand it over to our Group CFO, Andrew Miller. Thanks Mark. Turning to slide 17 for the quarterly four city cash flow summary. As at the 31st of December ' 21, the company's corporate cash balance was $523.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter ending 31 December, excluding the movement in player cash accounts, was $56 million. I'll now walk through each of the main line items. Receipts from customers for the quarter totaled $90.4 million. This includes net win from sports book and iGaming verticals of $77.3 million as previously presented by Sam and Johnny, and a balance of $13.1 million includes cash receipts from our European B2B operations, cash receipts from our U.S. rating ADW business, and a partial New York license fee reimbursement received from Resorts World Bet, a subsidiary of the Genting Group, as part of our B2B platform provider agreement to power the Resorts World Bet's online sports book operation in New York State. As early presented by Johnny, this strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an accretive and valuable partnership for the company, but not indicative of a larger B2B strategy of PointsBet. Cash outflows during the quarter included cost of sales of $44.8 million, which grew on the previous quarter in line with increased trading activity in both the U.S. and Australia. Non-capitalized stock costs of, of $18.9 million with growing, global FTS growing to 539 at the end of Q2, as we continue to build to scale. And in addition, we have support staff which are engaged by third party service companies. Marketing cash outflow for the quarter with $65.6 million. This increased quarter-on-quarter with slightly increased marketing expenses, as well as being due to the movement in prepayments and accruals from the prior quarter. As previously disclosed, the Australian marketing expense was 22.6 million AUD for the quarter. And the U.S. marketing expense was 29.7 million USD for the quarter. As noted by Sam, the Australian marketing expense will reduce significantly in H2, in H2 versus H1. And we expect the U.S. marketing expense in Q3 to be higher than Q2 as we launch new S- new U.S. States, including the recent launch in New York, and soon to be followed by Pennsylvania, our 10th U.S. State of operation. Cash outflows of administration, corporate costs, and GST paid on Australian net win was $17 million for the quarter. Turning to investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ending of 31 December, was 43.6 million AUD. The main driver of this outflow was the well documented market access payment to the New York State Gaming Commission of 25 million USD required to receive our New York State mobile wagering license. For further over the quarter, the company capitalized $7 million of technology and product staff wages as part of continued development of our sports wagering and iGaming platform. There was minimal cash flows from financing activities for the period, and the company has no corporate borrowings. At the end of December, we had $523 million in corporate cash. We take a disciplined approach to setting up the company for long-term success, investing in our unique and market-leading proprietary technology and product platform, continuing to grow the team to scale across the globe, and investing in our marketing strategy. I'll now hand back to Sam. Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 18, slide 18. And in closing, some brief words on Canada. We eagerly await the announcement of an official launch date for Ontario, which is imminent. Not be more pleased with what has been achieved by our team led by Canadian CEO, Scott Vanderwel. We are dedicated to delivering a brand and an experience that is genuinely Canadian. The deals that we have executed with Dailyfaceoff.com and the nation network, Carling Canada, the National Hockey League Alumni Association, and the Trailer Park Boys, are all true to this strategy. We are extremely confident in the efficiency of the cut throat these partnerships will deliver to grow brand recognition and acquire clients. In launching PointsBet Canada into Ontario, the Canadian team will leverage not only the proprietary technology and market leading product that the company has built, but also the global scale we now possess with a one team approach supported by staff in numerous continents. Thanks for your time. And we'll now take questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. The first question comes from Rohan Sundram from MST Financial. Please go ahead. Hi team. Uh, I might start with a question for Sam. Just how are you thinking about the long-term share asp- aspirations of the business in light of the ongoing increases in estimated North America TAM? So w- would you be happy with say a 5% share of a, a 70 billion market as opposed to say 10% of a 30 billion market? Is that how you're thinking about it? Thank you there, Rohan. No, I think… Look, our, our aspiration remains to, to work towards that 10% market share. I think the reality is, is what we thought, you know, in terms of a marketing budget that would us to achieve that, um, is now effectively probably a marketing budget that's more akin to achieving a, say a 3% or 4% market share. Because as you've sort of drawn the link to, the, the size of the market has grown dramatically and, and the size of the estimated size of the future market. So our competitors are being far more aggressive in line with that, and they're being far more aggressive from a promotional perspective. So, you know, I suppose our relative budget, if you think about us spending, you know, 27 last quarter and a little bit more this quarter, the market was probably spending close to a billion dollars those two quarters on marketing. So we're probably spending about 3% of what the market's spending for marketing. So it's a bit unrealistic for us to expect at this stage in the current environment to be, to be heading, you know, rapidly north towards that 10%. But as, you know, I suppose as we assume the market transitions, you know, it was interesting hearing Adam, um, the CEO of MGM, BetMGM yesterday or the day before, talk about maybe there's another 12 months of, um, you know, this heightened aggressiveness in the market, may be one more start of NFL season, but then their expectation is that perhaps things ease off a little bit. Um, and we probably, we probably agree with that. And in line with that, you know, obviously we are continuing to make rapid progress on our product strategy. So we think those two things combined, improving our brand. We're investing in our brand, we're investing in building data bases. Um, while it may take longer to get to that 10% given the, the growing TAM and the, and the amount that's being spent, you know, we still plan to get there as the market transitions to being more product-focused. Okay. Thanks. And, and on the New Jersey share, I know it's not the, the main game, but I take into account the, the reduction there in turn over, but given the high net win, how would you share look on a, a net win basis, especially given the first quarter was almost 8% net win. Yeah. Well, I mean that, New Jersey's a very good example. So, you know, from a market share perspective, we came under a bit of pressure again, but from a net win perspective, net win quarter-on-quarter was up to 24%, you know, so that's, that's a good example. We want to keep growing, growing net win. Now, if that's a smaller proportion of the market that we thought would be, that's in some ways a positive cause again, it talks to the fact that the market is bigger than most expected and, and is growing more rapidly. Um, Johnny made a comment during, um, his part about the fact that, you know, New Jer- Jersey now, it's becoming a bit of a trend that it's gross margin yields are yielding higher than our other States. And, you know, we look, we look at the reason behind that. And as he said, some of it is some variance, but, but some of it is definitely some differences in player behavior in terms of that slightly more mature market now cause it's been open a bit longer, players gravitating to the higher margin products, the same game parlays, the player props, et cetera. And we think, again, that's a positive trend for us because it shows that they're moving into the, let's call it the, the sweet spot for PointsBet, because this is where we aim to lead in terms of having the most engaging, um, product set. Thanks, Sam. Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Duff from SIG. Please go ahead. Uh, good morning, everyone. Um, you know, you, Sam, you talked about New Jersey, you know, Indiana and Michigan were, you know, the States, the bigger States that you have exposure to in the third quarter where you lost share. But, um, I guess the expectation rightfully, wrongfully, it would take a while to build those back, given the advertising and the promotional, uh, environment, but you were able to rebuild in Michigan. I was wondering, can you describe or talk about, you know, maybe some of the methods that you use to, to recapture some of that lost share in the fourth quarter ver- I'm sorry, in the, um, fiscal second quarter versus the first quarter? That's the first question. And then I wanted, um, to ask about customer acquisition costs. Um, Johnny, you had mentioned you guys are still, uh, running about $500 or so. And with your newer launch dates in Virginia and Pennsylvania in a month, or, you know, in February and, and New York, and your ability to rely on your RSNs, your NBC RSNs, would it be fair to assume that, that customer acquisition costs could come down in those particular markets? Hi Joe. Um, so in terms of Michigan, look again, I think the pleasing thing for Michigan, yes, our sports betting market share did go up, but again, even more importantly, I think we had 700,000 of net win last quarter and this quarter was so like 3.2 million. So again, really good growth in Michigan from a net, a net win perspective. Um, you know, I think obviously when you've got the casino products improving, uh, you know, when we, when we think about States that have a mix of sports betting and iGaming, you really do have to look at them in, in totality because it goes without saying that if client, um, goes and loses some money playing blackjack, well, then that's perhaps less money that they have to turn over on sports betting. So the two are, are generally related and thus, when you're looking at New Jersey, uh, Michigan, and, and soon to be West Virginia and Pennsylvania and States with, with mix, you have to look at the combined result, um, not, you know, with, there's, there's a difference if you just have sports betting to, to having sports betting, uh, and iGaming. Johnny, is there anything you'd wanna say about, um, Michigan in particular? I'd just add Sam that, ag- again, we view every State, a State as its own not country, and each State sort of differs in terms of the dynamics and how, again, consumers consume sport, the population, the, the distribution. You know, a market like Michigan is very unique. Uh, and in that particular, you know, we're seeing, I guess, the early results of our, a very smart investment with, um, O- uh, Olympia Entertainment. So they, um, owned the arena where the Pistons and the Red Wings play. We made a smart investment into building a sports bar next to the main entrance of the stadium. And when you've got at least 82 home games of NBA, NHL, and people are walking past the PointsBet brand going in and out of the arena and going in there and having a drink, it played a role in making sure the PointsBet's part of the yellow boost sporting fabric there, and part of the consideration when people in Michigan and Detroit is thinking about where to play the next bet or sign up. Thanks, Johnny. Yeah. In terms of the CAC, Joe, I mean, you know, we spent, and, and Johnny made a comment about this, we spent 20- 29.7 million on marketing, and that last quarter was similar in terms of, um, because we were waiting to launch in Vir- in, in Virginia. And we knew that we had upcoming launch and we were waiting q- q- you know, quietly confident of a positive outcome in New York. And again, confident of a positive outcome with licensing in Pennsylvania. It's been a strange couple of quarters because a, a fair chunk of our marketing budget has gone into the Washington RSN, the, the Philly RSN and, and SNY in New York. So as those States go live, Virginia, now New York and, and soon Pennsylvania, you know, that, that spend goes from being sort of out of State to, to being in live States. And so that proportion of, let's call it somewhat spend that was going outside and maybe less efficient. Yes, it was building the brand and, and warming those States up. That then comes in States. So I don't necessarily, I wouldn't necessarily say that taxes are gonna come down because we're now, um, going, um, you know, live into those States, but we certain- certainly do believe that those, it's, it's been the model that we've used, obviously in, in Chicago that, um, you know, we're never gonna outspend these big guys at the moment, but, you know, the audience watches live sport. You know, we've got Philly, 76ers, all the teams that Johnny spoke about, the Mets in, in, in New York, et cetera, um, getting in front of those eyeballs through those RSNs, we think is a very efficient, uh, mechanism to grow our brand and, and acquire clients. Thank you guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from Desmond Star from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hello. Hi, team. Um, I've just got a couple of questions around slide, uh, 14 and 15. I think you guys provided some interesting detail, uh, on those two slides. Um, you know, obviously I think Mark noted a couple of industry-first achievements by the business in the U.S. and obviously now with Banach and the rise of in-play. I was wondering if you can just talk a bit more about the opportunity that in-play presents, and then more specifically, whether you have a sense of market share within in-play. You know, would it be fair to say that your share of the in-play market is actually far greater than the blended 4.2% share that you talked to today? Good question. Um, yeah, I think in terms of the opportunity, yeah, I want, I really want this to be clear in terms of stepping through the dynamics of the U.S. market. Um, you know, we've, we've been at, at a disadvantage because we didn't come from an iGaming background. Most of the companies that we're competing against… New Jersey legalized iGaming back in something like 2013. Um, so all of, most of our competitors have been operating iGaming in America, in one State at least, and maturing all of their products and practices for, for some time, you know, pre-past them being repealed. Um, add to that, as I said, the fact that we took the time to build our own platform, because we wanna, we wanna own it, we wanna keep the margin for the long-term. You know, we have been at a competitive disadvantage from a product set perspective, but also from a revenue perspective of, of not having had, um, having had that product. But as we think about, you know, forward-looking States, you know, I think it, it needs to be clear that all the States that are going live now and launching, are all sports betting only. So iGaming expertise is not gonna necessarily get you, get you anywhere if you don't have sports betting expertise. And our, obviously our blueprint is to win our market share on the back of our sports betting expertise. And then when iGaming does get legalized, you know, two years later, or three years later for a particular State, we've already got, um, hundreds of thousands of clients and we can cross-sell 40% of them or whatever that number is, to iGaming, versus, you know, someone who was focused on iGaming, well, they won't have any market share. Um, if they don't have a proprietary sports betting product, um, they're, they're not gonna win that market share in those sports betting States. But within, you know, that earning of market from sports betting, I don't think there's, there's any operators out there that aren't talking about, um, a 75% in-play, uh, market. Uh, so, so everyone's, everyone's agreeing that 75% of sports bets will be placed in-play. And, you know, we are on a path to, we believe, leading, um, within that sector. Now we wanna lead within the entire product sector. So we want to have the best product full stop, and that includes, you know, improving our iGaming product. Um, but, you know, leading the way and now starting to deliver on, um, some of our product vision. Part of the challenge when you build something from scratch, you know, and we built, we've built this tech stack from scratch, even in Australia and, you know, at, at the start with not a lot of resources, it, it takes time to, to deliver things. Um, and we're now getting to the point where, um, you know, we, we are delivering. You know, we're starting to innovate as, you know, 100% uptime in-play, in-play same-game parlay, et cetera. So when it comes to, you know, the in-play vision and how important it's gonna be for winning market share and ultimately succeed in the U.S. I don't think anyone's in= in- indoubt with that. And, and I hope, you know, um, the market is starting to see how PointsBet, um, is already leading in this category, but is gonna put the foot down and continue to, um, you know, to really, um, put a gap on there. Um, in terms of market share, in-play market share, I'll throw to, I'll throw to Johnny. But I would just say, um, perhaps, you know, I, I think it's still a customer journey, and that's what we were talking about from the, from the New Jersey perspective that, you know, the market is still very focused on the promos, et cetera. It'll, it'll gradually, um, gravitate to be more product-focused. And then there's the second part to that is though, as clients get a little bit more sophisticated as we're seeing in New Jersey and they branch away from the core bet types into, you know, uh, more creative bet types and higher margin, uh, bet types. But Johnny, do you a feel for whether you believe we're already over indexing from, uh, in-play perspective? Yes, Sam. I think I, I think the true sort of read through will be, um, sort of, sort of Q3 onwards, this quarter and onwards. And the reason being there that, again, in Q2 we, we saw NFL and NBA move on to our, our, uh, internal trading feeds powered by, uh, the Banach Technology. And so now sort of for each quarter ahead, we'll get a true read of, of the power that drives. You know, one of the things I think is misunderstood by, um, the market is that it isn't just about competing for in-play on the number of markets you have. Um, it isn't just about building play pops and micro markets. Really, the core tenet of offering an in-play experience that drives repeat that usage and allows you to lean in on, on your product over sort of, again, sort of covering, uh, maybe with gaps in the product with heavier sort of promotions, centers around being up, up the longest, again, you know, sort of aiming towards that zero sort of betting suspensions and giving consumers that complete experience to place a bet, to cash out their bet, uh, without, again, um, you know, the moment when the, the market are rather suspended. And then the second tenet is around the speed, uh, to accept the bet. Again, you know, we sort of know that our competition in general applies 7 to 10 second bet delay, um, when any in-play bet is placed. And then after that 7 to 10 seconds passes and the bet is then, um, pinged again to the trading, uh, software that's being used externally by a lot of our competitors, 50% of the time, the bet's being rejected due to a price change, or again, due to the market being suspended. Again, you know, we're, uh, again, actively working and sort of backing in the models, um, that have been delivered by Banach sort of backing in, again, the pricing efficiency that we have, that we have the confidence to, to, uh, recontinue to put as many clients as we can on zero bet delay. And so not only matching, again, as I said, that, that sort of, um, you know, sort of uptime goal to, again, continue to increase that, but also accepting bets, um, you know, in sort of lightning speed. And if we're up the longest and quickest to accept, we think that combined with our product features and then the, again, distribution of the message of PointsBet being, uh, the king of in-play particularly across the NBC platforms. Again, it's gonna be a huge ongoing driver of client activity for business. Great. Thanks Sam. Thanks Johnny. Appreciate it. That's all for me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Gava from Credit List. Please go ahead. Hi, team. A few questions for me. Um, Sam, just in New Jersey, uh, I, you know, hearing how you guys evolved, um, you know, the management of that, uh, offering there. Um, can you talk to whether that involved a churn of customers or is it, did you migrate existing customers into new patterns, um, how that play out? And is this, uh, sort of first date? How come you didn't sort of take this approach in Illinois yet? Is it just a different cir- circumstance there? Okay, Larry. Um, I think across the, across the business, you know, we made a comment and I think Johnny referenced it again, that last quarter, we probably didn't focus enough on our existing clients or our high quality clients and, um, with our, with our promotions and focused on, you know, the acquisition period. And I think, you know, we, we, we do wanna focus on quality clients, uh, without wanting to… Everyone's got their own strategies, but, you know, there's… Acquiring clients, um, is not hard. You know, we, we can run promotions and, um, give away money and just acquire client, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of those clients are gonna be of, of value. So we are trying to find the, the balance. Um, and I think that's the message, you know, coming out that, yes, um, we will keep growing, but we wanna keep growing, um, responsibly. Um, so if, you know, adding another 10,000 actives or 20,000 actives, if those actives are, are no good and that, then that's the same in terms of churn. There's no point trying to hold onto some clients if they're just, they're just genuinely not, not genuine. Um, then, then, you know, we make, we make no, uh, apologies for, for doing that. So, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't sort of say that we're actively, um, you know, targeting, um, segments or, you know, disconnecting from certain segments, apart from unprofitable segments, you know, clients that are just not gonna be worth anything. Uh, and in terms of Illinois, no, it's, it's very similar. Um, it's, it's, it's very similar. The strategy's the same. You know, it's about, it's about a focus on value continue to grow. It's just the dynamics work out that in, in New Jersey, we grew revenue by that 24%, um, quarter-on-quarter, lost a bit of market share. Um, in Illinois, we were able to continue growth without losing that market share, but the s- the strategy is consistent. Hmm. Okay. Excellent there. And, um, with New Jersey, just continuing on that, um, I think you did about 15 million of net win in the half. Let's say we annualize that in a bit more. New Jersey's been funding, um, marketing for new States, but if we kinda withdraw that new State support, um, are we getting it close to break-even in New Jersey alone to sort of isolate just New Jersey marketing? Yeah, I think, I think we are, uh, Larry. You know, I mean, I think when we do 10.8 for the quarter, I would rather times that by 4, um, because the iGaming product has come in and that wasn't necessarily, um, present in, in, in previous quarters. You know, there's a few… There's a lot happening in New Jersey. There's a lot of market dynamics still there. So I'll, I'll call out a few. You know, obviously going live in New York and being, um, one of, um, an exclusive group that will be live in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, will be helpful going live in Pennsylvania. We spoke to that, that Philly audience. The continued growth of the iGaming product, um, is gonna be vitally important. But, you know, I think, um, I think by the middle of next year, um, you know, we think New Jersey is, is turning profitable. So, um, you know, post the, the pass bar cessation of sports, you know, sport came back- COVID. middle of post- COVID in the middle of 2020, sort of had to restart the business. And so, you know, we think by the end of next financial we're, we're turning profitable. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Don Carducci from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Morning, everyone. So just a couple quick ones from me. So if I think about the net new active customers, where did they, they come from? Uh, was it the new markets or was it maybe those markets that you had been in for 12 months or more? Hey, Don. Yeah. I mean, look, obviously we acquire clients in all, in all new markets. The difference being that in a market like New Jersey, where you have been, uh, live for some time, you also churn clients out, out the back end. So the increase in active clients is a, is a net effect. It's what you've added. Obviously the increase we've acquired more first time bettors than that increase in actives, but we've also churned some clients in the backend. So that's the, that's the net, the net effect. Yeah, no, g- got it. I understand that. So I guess if I rephrase the question, I mean, you, you have churn. Is the majority of this churn coming from new States or is it coming from the existing States that you've been in for 12 months or more like New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana? Yeah, no, by, by the definition, because we're giving a 12 month rolling number, it has to be States that we've been live in for more than 12 months, because if we've been live in six in, in, um, a state for six months, for example, um, all of those clients would be in the 12 month active number. Gotcha. And then can you give us a little bit of clarity on like the cash guidance maybe for next quarter, um, include, you know, license payments, et cetera. Obviously Pennsylvania, that's a, that's a steep one, uh, New Jersey, but just kind of a little bit of guidance on what we should expect for that. Yeah, sure Don Sandy. You know, I think, and just talk to, to, cashburn generally, you know, we're continuing to build obviously for the long-term and investing in this opportunity, particularly in the U.S. and, and the product. Um, and that is requiring a reasonable level of upfront investment, as you mentioned, the, the market access requirements, licensing requirements, and the marketing investment, which I think that's pretty, pretty well understood as we roll out into, into new States. As, uh, as it relates to, um, the market access, access payment, obviously this was a, a larger payment that we made in New York, which was 25 million US in Q2. Um, the payment required for Pennsylvania, uh, is 11 million USD, which, which will be paid in Q3. So the business development payments for, for Q3 will be lower than, than Q2. Gotcha. Thanks team. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
      "withCtc" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Pointset Holdings Limited Q2 FY 2022 Appendix 4C Investor presentation. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sam Wanel, Group CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining the Pointsbirth Holding Limited second quarter financial year 2022 Business Update and Activities Report. This is Group CEO Sam Swannel, and I'm joined on the call today by our Group CFO Andrew Mellor, our US CEO Johnny Aitken in Denver and our Group Chief Operating Officer Mark Hughes, who is joining us from Dublin. But before we begin, please note all numbers referred to are unaudited and in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated. Turning to slide three. The December two thousand twenty one quarter, as well as the month of January, has been a period of great progress for Point Spit. During the quarter, we saw improvement in relation to many of our core financial metrics, and we've also made great strides in terms of expanding our addressable market and delivering on our product vision. This has been headlined by an exciting launch into New York this week. New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States and we were very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators to gain access. This is in addition to our launch in Virginia last month and will be followed by our launch into Pennsylvania in February. These are obviously very substantial markets and allow PointSpet to leverage key NBC regional sports network assets in each market. We also this week launched iGaming in West Virginia. We will continue to grow our total addressable market rapidly, with Ontario, Canada likely to follow Pennsylvania, and at least a further seven states are expected to be added in North America in calendar year 2022. In November, we were thrilled to deliver our first major in-play product upgrade following the acquisition of Bannock Technologies, now known as Points Bet Europe. Sports Betting is the product that is leading the expansion of online betting across the USA. To win market share and deliver success in the US market will require excellence in sports betting product and execution. As sports betting is legalized across the US, we anticipate that 75% of all online bets will be placed in play, that is, once a match has already started. Providing an elite, optimized client experience for in-play betting is beyond the capabilities of most operators who do not have modern in house proprietary technology, combined with advanced models and automated real time trading systems. US sports in particular continues to be poorly serviced in terms of the in-play client experience. PointSpet's superior optimised client experience, in particular around in play, will clearly differentiate us from our opposition. The PointSpet Europe upgrade has now been applied to NFL and recently NBA. Further sports will swiftly follow. The impact on our NFL KPIs has been impressive and provides huge encouragement regarding the path we are on. In play handle is up forty four percent since the upgrade, and group COO Mark Hughes will speak to other impressive positive indicators later in the presentation. It is also worth mentioning that this month Pointsbet became the first operator in the US to offer in-play betting with the zero suspensions or one hundred percent uptime across the core markets of NFL's spread and money line. Most people would be unaware that the majority of operators are operating at just seventy percent of uptime, meaning that when a client attempts to place a bet, the market is suspended 30% of the time. It's not hard to see the difference in player experience between the two outcomes and thus the positive sentiment and ultimately ongoing patronage that will be earned by the superior product experience. In addition to in-play betting, another key product battleground is parlays and, in particular, same-gate parlays. As such, it gives me great pride to announce that this week Points Bet released its Market First NFL and NBA in play or live same game parlay. Points Bet Same Game Parla has proven incredibly popular with our clients, and providing them with the opportunity to place these bets during a game is a further example of how Points Bet is hitting its stride, leveraging the capabilities of our proprietary technology and models. As you'll see in today's numbers, it's also great to see US net win increase 64% quarter on quarter to reflect the improvements we've made across the business. That improvement also includes eye gaming. As is well recognised, Points Bet was late to the US market from an eye gaming perspective. We were not in New Jersey pre-PASPA repeal like many of our competitors, and we took the time to build our own in-house proprietary platform as we set the business up the correct way for long term success. But we're now making swift ground. In November we we released the Evolution Live Casino product set into Michigan and this was completed for New Jersey in January. Our gaming net win was up one hundred and forty five percent quarter on quarter, and with West Virginia having launched this week and Pennsylvania and Ontario upcoming, we will see iGaming revenues continue to climb on the back of our ever-improving product suite. In Australia, the December quarter saw the seamless delivery of record activity across the Spring Carnival. It is imperative that we deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable system that meets the needs of our clients on peak days such as Melbourne Cup Day. On Corfield Cup and Everest Day, Pointsbit Australia processed over 4,000 bets per minute, up 2.5 times on last year. On Melbourne Cup Day, we processed over six hundred and eighty-three thousand bets for the day, setting a new record. This continues Points Bet's impressive record of successfully managing peak days without incident in both Australia and the US. To wrap up my introduction, I want to return to the US. In New Jersey, we've historically operated without the benefits of high gaming revenue and without the benefits of also being live in Pennsylvania. Many clients cross the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania and will not use an app that is not operational in both markets. We have the Philadelphia Regional Sports Network via our relationship as the official sports betting partner of NBC. This delivers us integration exclusivity for all Seventy Sixers, Phillies, and Flyers games, an extremely powerful asset. We've been utilizing this asset to reach the South Jersey audience, but will shortly be able to unlock its full benefits by being live in Pennsylvania. Following our New York launch earlier this week, we are now amongst an exclusive group of operators that will be live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. In New York, we are again leveraging our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SNY is the regional broadcast home of Major League Baseball's New York Mets. In addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the NFL's New York Jets, they offer points bet year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities. In parallel with these exciting developments, PointSpec continues to deliver on its product vision. Recent months provide a taste of what is to come with market-leading innovation as we now leverage the hard work that has gone into building our proprietary technology and product. While it is disappointing to see the recent performance at our share price, we continue to focus on achieving our key operational priorities, investing in our proprietary best-in-class technology, and working towards our long-term growth goals. We will now drill into particular focus areas. Slide four. Compared to the group results for Q two FY two thousand twenty-one to be referred to as the PCP in Q2 FY twenty two, sports birding turnover was up eleven per cent at one point three three billion dollars. Our sports betting gross win was up sixty per cent at $133.8 million, and sports betting group net win was up sixty one per cent at seventy one point nine million dollars. Q two FY twenty two iGaming net win of five point four million represented a hundred and forty five percent increase quarter on quarter. Now turning to slide five. The Australian trading business continued its strong performance, ending the quarter with turnover of $727 million, up thirty-four per cent compared to the PCP, and net win of fifty-three point one million, up seven per cent from the PCP. However, net win was marginally lower than Q one FY twenty two, reflecting the business's focus on promotional activity during the Spring Carnival. Gross win margin and net win margin were twelve point seven percent and seven point three percent respectively. Now turning to slide six. The Australian trading business's Q two marketing expense was twenty two point six million dollars, which assisted in delivering twelve month rolling cash active clients to thirty one December of 232,875, an increase of 63% compared to the PCP. To take advantage of the latter parts of the NRL and AFL seasons and the spring racing carnival, the FY twenty two marketing budget was skewed towards H1 to build our brand and to acquire and retain clients over this important period of the sporting and racing calendar. Marketing expense in H2 will be substantially lower than H one as we execute this strategy to front end marketing expense this financial year and leverage our fantastic shack assets. Now turning to slide seven. Compared to the PCP, the Australian trading business has been in suit has seen improvement across several KPIs. We saw a 15% growth of first-time betters. This was particularly pleasing given 2020 saw both AFL and NRL finals shift from September to October, resulting in increased first-time better activity in the PCP. Pointsbed's app download volume grew by 121.3% compared to the PCP, representing the largest gain across all major competitors. Full context, Sportsbed increased volume by thirty four point five percent and Tab by thirty three point nine percent, respectively, compared to the PCP. And Pointsbed's brand awareness grew significantly. As mentioned earlier, I'm also very pleased to report that our in-house proprietary system successfully processed record betting activity through the spring racing carnival. We saw new peaks reached for scale indicators such as bets per minute, concurrent active user sessions, and settlements. Success on such big days in Australia provides the global team with even more confidence in the stability and scalability of our tech stack and trading systems as we enter into the NFL finals and launch in y more US states. I will now hand over to US CEO Johnny Aitken to provide commentary on our US business. Thank you, Sam. Turning to slide eight. In leading off, I wanted to say that we are pleased with the trade during the quarter. As communicated in january two thousand twenty one, the December two thousand twenty quarter for handle, gross win and net win results was impacted by short term by trading variances, which reversed in January of two thousand twenty one, and as such the PCP comparison growth rate should be viewed with this in mind. Pleasingly, Q two net win of twenty four point one million have represented quarter on quarter growth of sixty four percent. We remain focused on generating net win in our US business and doing so in a sustainable and disciplined fashion. Please refer to Appendix one of the presentation for a state by state breakdown of handle gross, win, and net wins. Handle for the quarter was five hundred and ninety-eight point nine million, up seventy-two percent quarter on quarter. Handle shows a decline on PCP, but please know my earlier comments on the impact of last year's short term trading variances. I'd like to take a moment here to outline a very important part of our strategy. We are extremely focused on ensuring that every dollar of handle we book will ultimately drive value and revenue. In line with this, our focus is aimed at ensuring every client we acquire is capable of being revenue generating. Rather than focusing on the sheer number of actives, our experienced customer intelligence and trading analytics teams are intensely focused on calculating the lifetime value of our clients, ensuring they are accurately and quickly profiled, targeting, procuring, and retaining the right clients continues to be very important. Point Spet's blended US online handle market share in the states we are we are operational in, consolidated, was four point two percent for the quarter, compared to four point five percent in Q one of FY twenty two. A further breakdown of market share for estate can be found on slide eight. Lost handle is one indicator of business scale. We remain focused on growing network. Our strong sense is that analysts and operators agree that the market will transition from from being heavily promotional driven to one where the product experience is the primary driver of operator success, combined with scale by distribution, and we certainly have the latter via our partnership with MBC. I note the heightened gross win margin that Pointsbit has delivered in New Jersey compared to all other states. This is partly due to variance, but is also being driven by the more advanced life cycle of the New Jersey market, as customers adopt more diverse products such as parlays and player props, away from the traditional lower pre-game margin spreads, totals, and moneyline bets. This is an encouraging forward looking trend that plays to Points Beth's innovation strengths, controlled by our proprietary tech and internal trading models. Our quick parlay builder, parlay booster, same game parlay, and now in-game same game parlay are just the beginning of ongoing product feature enhancements. Now turning to slide nine. U2 marketing expenses were 29.7 million US dollars, and I'm pleased to report that the overall US working media cost per per F was again under $500. We continue to invest in marketing and growing the brand across the US. Cash Actives grew to two hundred and eleven thousand, up two hundred and ten percent compared to the PCP. It should be noted that this metric also reflects our retention efforts, not just acquisition volumes. Further, a sizeable portion of this quarter's marketing investment was into audiences outside of what were eight live states. This investment targeted upcoming states like Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania, and more broadly acts to build brand awareness in the database nationally to assist future state launches. We noted in the FY twenty two Q one call that there was an opportunity to better utilize our Watactical promotions. A number of optimizations were made during Q two, refining our approach with a focus on rewarding our high value engaged client cohort and gaining an improved share of wallet from them. We reinvested a smaller proportion of gross gaming revenue on promotions in Q two compared to Q one. While slightly lower than the peak seen in September and October, competition remained significant in the quarter, specifically as it related to promotional activity. Thus, it was important to retain and incentivize our valued clients with all four the major pro sports together being active along with college basketball and college football. However, it should be noted that we expect to gradually bring down the rate of promotional investment further in time as we continue to focus and lead with our superior products. Turning to slide eleven, we are excited by the opportunity before us this calendar year as we target to be operational at least seventeen states in the US and also Ontario, Canada, our calendar year end. Our mid December launch of online sports betting operations in Virginia with our partner Colonial Downs marked the eighth operational states for points Bet, and one of our most successful state launches to date when looking at FTBs driven from MBC properties. Virginia represents a large market opportunity with a population of eight point five million, a comparable size to New Jersey and with a rich sports history. Capping over twenty-two thousand leads at launch, largely driven by our partnership with NBC and leveraging local legend, an eleven time NBA All Star uh Alan Iverson, appointed brand ambassador, our Virginia launch exceeded our execution goals. In the first week of launch, Virginia FTBs acquired by NBC channels were almost five times higher than F T Bs acquired in the first week post launch in the state of Michigan. This launch demonstrated that we continue to improve our strategic go to market plans that are leveraging our MBC partnership and execution capabilities. Viewers have been familiar with the Points Beth brand through our exclusive odds integrations and expert expert analysis during key NBC television broadcasts, including Sunday Night Football, where Points Bet brand ambassadors and NBC NFL talent Drew Brees and Chris Sims host the Points Bet Pulse segment with an audience of nearly twenty million people each week. Notably, NBC's Washington Regional Sports Network Affiliate is prominent throughout the region, including Maryland's, an upcoming launch date for 2022, and serves as the exclusive regional broadcast home of the NBA's Washington Wizards and the NHL Washington Capitals. They're utilizing NBC's regional sports networks and owned and operated broadcast stations, unlocks a a daily presence with local market teams and top sporting events, creating a f familiarity with the points of brand prior to launch. In December, we were named the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the University of Maryland Athletics. This multi year agreement marks the first ever sportsbetting partnership within the storied Big Ten Conference and follows our deal with the University of Colorado, which has provided a template to work within the the university space. The University of Maryland Athletics boasts more than three million fans worldwide, with nearly two hundred thousand located in the DMV region, which stands for Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. Also is announced on the twenty fifth of january two thousand twenty two, Point Bet launched operations in New York by representing another major milestone for our company, our brand and our technology. As Sam mentioned earlier, New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States, and we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators in the Big Apple. We will again look to leverage our NBC partnership through Sportsnet MY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. SMY is the the regional broadcast home of the Major League Baseball's New York Mets, in addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the New York Jets. They offer points out with year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities across its unmatched portfolio of events. PointSpet will have additional leverage opportunities as one of only six uh operators that have a New York access and official NFL partnership status. As we plan for Pennsylvania to launch next month, our focus will be on the significant Philadelphia and Pittsburgh markets. Since going live in New Jersey in 2019, we have been utilizing NBC Sports Philadelphia to reach the the South Jersey audience. This includes linear inventory and integration across the Flyers, the Seventy-sixers and the Phillies, which taps into their hometown affection to their teams with both with uh digital both on their national sites, geo-targeted ads in New Jersey, and utilizing MBC Sports dot com's RSN specific website. As made public by the New York State Gaming Commission on the thirteenth of August 2021, points bet as an appr approved platform provider. We'll also provide the resorts world, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Genting Group, with a B to B mobile sports wagering uh service in the our state of New York. This strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an a creative and valuable partnership for the company, but not but not uh indicative of a larger B2B strategy of Points Bet. Aside from the unique economic opportunity presented by Resorts World Better New York, Points Bet remains solely focused on our B2C sportsbook and our gaming operations. Turning to slide twelve. Industry analysts keep increasing the estimated size of the US online sports betting gross gaming revenue TAM opportunity. As we launched new states in two by two thousand and twenty two, a coverage of the US population, and with that our TAM our TAM opportunity continues to grow what uh considerably. We've seen some estimates point to an online sports spending TAM and maturity of US about EU forty two billion and on top of that the US eighteen billion for uh for our gaming. We would note that horse racing is not not commonly included in these the US TAM estimates. However, from our our our experiences in Australia, we do think there is future upside in this category to be realised in the US. Hence why we bought Bet Bet PTC, a US advanced deposit horse horse wager in business last year. With the recent launch in New York, the nine states Points bed is currently live in represents a total target population of sixty two million people with an approximate sportsbook tan of ten and a half billion US dollars at maturity. Adding in near term launches of Pennsylvania, Ontario, Louisiana, Tennessee, Maryland, and Ohio represents a further target population of forty six million, an additional six point eight per billion sportsbook TAM opportunity. Turning to slide thirteen. The NBC and Points Bear Partnership entered its second year at the start of September 2021, and the partnership continued to draw continues to drive results and break new ground in the category. It should be noted that at the end of the quarter, only sixteen point five percent of the total NBC lead base was a direct first time better opportunity for points bet. However, that number will jump to an approximate about twenty six percent come February two thousand twenty two, once both New York and Pennsylvania are launched and grow even higher over the calendar year. I'm pleased with how the partnership is developing and excited for the innovation we have planned in H two. The coming period will include a a more robust uh uh a more robust sort of digital plan, incorporating MBC's new Y Regional Connected TV and over the top plus solutions spot on. There are also additional opportunities for inclusion on their quickly growing streaming platform, PCOP. This combination of national and regional networks along with the local the local TV assets gives us the ability to create bespoke bespoke strategies to reach any audience. I'd like to now introduce our group chief Operating Officer Mark Hughes, formerly the CEO of Bannock Technology. Mark began his career working for Patty Power, now part now part of the now part of the Flutter Group, I should say. As a pivotal member of the quantitative analytics team. As previously noted, in play betting is estimated to make up at least seventy five percent in DAUS of all sports wagering activity go within the next three years, and Points Bed acquired banned technology to take advantage of this in play opportunity. Mark will highlight the progress we've made in this area again over the quarter, uh integrating the Bannock trading platform. Over to you Mark. Thank you, Johnny. Now turning to slide fourteen. Implay is our North Star. We believe in the value that sports betting brings in enhancing the viewing experience of a sporting event. And we are building a product to appeal to the user that enjoys that experience. We are on the journey to building an all with on experience that drives customer engagement and repeats usage, meaning more player days, more engagement for player days, and ultimately a higher delivery of utility to the customer. Our data shows that in play delivers the product experience to keep the user engaged and on app during a session, our in-play customers demonstrate a higher average bet size, they bet more frequently, they have more bets per play day, and ultimately a higher average revenue per user. Turning to slide 15. The launch of our enhanced in house in pay model for NFL in October 2021 represented a big milestone for the company. Points that acquired Bannock Technology in early 2021 with the intent to accelerate ambitions to deliver a world-class in-play betting experience to our customers in the US. Bannock Technology was founded with the vision to build a modern sports betting technology platform to support the delivery of a more enriched and quality betting experience for the INPLE customer C US. Since launching the new INPLE NFL model, we have already seen key results when compared to the period immediately prior to release. Firstly, the improved betting experience. The new algorithm has reduced the amount of time our in play product is suspended for betting by more than forty percent. This results in a significant increase in the volume of opportunities our customer has to place a bet. This, coupled with improved bet placement journeys, has led to a reduction of approximately 50% in bets rejected. Secondly, product expansion. We have increased fourfold the number of betting markets our players can bet on. This includes the addition of player prop betting markets and the market first in play same game parlay. We also need our customers to show an appetite to engage with this new content, and the early statistics have showed huge promise with our proportion of turnover outside the three core betting markets increasing by forty-two percent. Our users want to play this product and we'll continue to deliver for them. This also offers a proportional increase in cash out opportunities for our customers. And thirdly, results. Our stated North Star is in play, and our hypothesis is that a product improvements will drive our users to better in-play. Since the launch of our NFL model, in play is a proportion of overall NFL handles has grown by forty four percent. We're continuing to push the boundaries of the customer experience, and with the integration of the official NFL data from BetGenius, we have seen further improvements in both in play betting availability and bet delays. January has seen the introduction of our in house in play MBA product and we will plan a fast follow up for our in house in play NCAAB model and an overall improvement in our in play tennis offering with the introduction of IGF tennis. We're forecasting similar improvements on other in house products and continued momentum towards our vision to deliver a world-class in-play betting experience to our customers. Evidencing our progress during NBC's playoff game on Saturday, fifteenth of January, between the Raiders and the Bengals wildcard, we are proud to have become the first US sports betting provider to offer clients live in game betting opportunities with zero suspensions across the core markets of spread and money line. All of the aforementioned initiatives demonstrate our ability to continue to innovate and lead the market with unique and value adding products. Turning to slide sixteen, I would now like to touch upon iGaming. The iGaming product continues to show strong quota on quota improvement with net win up one hundred and forty five percent. We were particularly excited to have launched our live dealer table solution in Michigan in November and New Jersey in December, including Blackjack, Roulette and Baccarat. The introduction of live dealer gaming is a welcome addition to Pointsbet's growing wagering product suite. Our live gaming options in Michigan offer top-tier choices for our players and will serve as a template as iGaming expands in other jurisdictions in the US and Canada. We launched iGaming in West Virginia on January twenty seventh, and anticipate further launches in Pennsylvania and Ontario in the coming months. Importantly, we look forward to the continued product improvements we have in development as we move to the next phase of our iGaming offering, including a significantly enhanced games library, automated promotional functionality, personalized offerings and other innovations. We will continue to see online casino in customer activity and revenue generation over the coming months. And now I'd like to hand it over to our group CFO, Andrew Meller. Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide seventeen for the quarterly force City cash flow summary. As of the 31st of December 21, the company's corporate cash balance was $523.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter ending 31 December, excluding the movement in player cash accounts, was fifty-six million dollars. I'll now walk through each of the main line items. Receipts from customers for the quarter totaled ninety point four million dollars. This includes net win from sportsbook and iGaming verticals of seventy-seven point three million dollars as previously presented by Sam and Johnny. And the balance of thirteen point one million dollars includes cash receipts from our European B2B operations, cash receipts from our US racing ADW business, and a partial New York licence fee reimbursement received from Resorts World Bet, a subsidiary of the Genting Group, as part of our B2B platform provider agreement to power the Resorts World Bets online sportsbook operation in New York State. As earlier presented by Johnny, this strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an accretive and valuable partnership for the company, but not indicative of a larger B2B strategy of PointsPat. Cash outflows during the quarter included cost of sales of forty four point eight million dollars, which grew on the previous quarter in line with increased trading activity in both the US and Australia. Non capitalised staff costs of eighteen point nine million dollars, with growing global FTEs growing to five hundred thirty and nine at the end of Q two as we continue to build to scale, and in addition we have support staff which are engaged by third party service companies. Marketing cash outflow for the quarter was sixty five point six million. This increased quarter on quarter with slightly increased marketing expenses, as well as being due to the movement in prepayments and accruals from the prior quarter. As previously disclosed, the Australian marketing expense was twenty two point six million Australian dollars for the quarter, and the US marketing expense was twenty nine point seven million US dollars for the quarter. As noted by Sam, the Australian marketing expense will reduce significantly in H two versus H1, and we expect the U.S. marketing expense in Q3 to be higher than Q2 as we launch new US states, including the recent launch in New York and soon to be followed by Pennsylvania, our tenth US state of operation. Cash outflows of administration corporate costs and GST paid on Australian net win was $17 million doll forars the quarter. Turning to investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ending of 31 December was forty three point six million Australian dollars. The main driver of this outflow was the well documented market access payment to the New York State Gaming Commission of 25 million US dollars required to receive our New York State mobile wagering licence. Further over the quarter, the company capitalised 7 million dollars of technology and product staff wages as part of continued development of our sports wagering and iGaming platform. There was minimal cash flows from financing activities for the period and the company has no corporate borrowings. At the end of December we had $523 million in corporate cash. We take a disciplined approach to setting up the company for long-term success, investing in our unique and market leading proprietary technology and product platform, continuing to grow the team to scale across the globe and investing in our marketing strategy. I'll now hand back to Sam. Thanks Andy. Turning to slide 18 and in closing some brief words on Canada. We eagerly await the announcement of an official launch date for Ontario, which is imminent. I could not be more pleased with what has been achieved by our team led by Canadian CEO Scott Vanderwell. We are dedicated to delivering a brand and an experience that is genuinely Canadian. The deals that we have executed with DailyFairsoft.com and the Nation Network, Curling Canada, the National Hockey League Alumni Association, and the Trailer Park Boys are all true to this strategy. We are extremely confident in the efficiency of the cut through these partnerships will deliver to grow brand recognition and acquire clients. In launching Pointsback Canada into Ontario, the Canadian team will leverage not only the proprietary technology and market leading product that the company has built, but also the global scale we now possess with a one team approach supported by staff in numerous continents. Thanks for your time and we'll now take questions. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star to. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Your first question comes from Rohan Syndr fromome MST. Financial Please go ahead. Hi team. Uh might start with a question for Sam. Just how are you thinking about the long term share aspirations of the business in light of the ongoing increases in estimated North America TAM. So would you be happy with say a five percent share of a a seventy billion dollar market as opposed to say ten percent of a thirty billion dollar market? Is that how you're thinking about it? I get Iran. No, I think look our our aspiration remains to to work towards that ten percent market share. I think the reality is is what we thought, you know, in terms of a marketing budget that would allow us to achieve that um is now effectively probably a marketing budget that's more akin to achieving a say a three or four percent market share. Because as you've sort of drawn the link to the the size of the market has grown dramatically and and the size, the estimated size of the future market so our competitors are being far more aggressive in line with that and they're being far more aggressive from a promotional perspective. So, you know, I suppose our relative budget, if you think about us spending you know twenty seven last quarter and a little bit more this quarter, the market was probably spending close to a billion dollars those two quarters on marketing. So we're probably spending about three percent of what the market's spending for marketing. So it's a bit unrealistic for us to expect at this stage in the current environment to be to be heading, you know, rapidly north towards that ten percent. But as you know, I suppose as we assume the market transitions, you know, it was interestinging hear Adam um the CEO of MGM, bet MGM yesterday or the day before, talk about maybe there's another twelve months of um you know this heightened aggressiveness in the market, maybe one more start of NFL season, but then their expectation is that perhaps things ease off a little bit. Um and we probably we probably agree with that. And in line with that, you know, obviously we're continuing to make rapid progress on our product strategy. So we think those two things combined, improving our brand, we're investing in our brand, we're investing in building databases. While it may take longer to get to that ten percent, given the the growing TAM and the and the amount that's being spent, you know, we still plan to get there as the market transitions to being more product focused. Okay. Thanks. And and on the New Jersey share, I know it's not the the main game but I take into account the the reduction there in turnover. But given the high net win, how would you share look on a a net win basis, especially given the first quarter was almost eight percent net win? Yeah, well I mean that New Jersey's a very good example. So you know from a market share perspective we came under a bit of pressure again but that from a net win perspective, net win quarter on quarter was up twenty four percent. You know, so that's that's a good example. We want to keep growing growing net win. Now if that's a smaller por portion of the market than we thought would be, that's in some ways a positive because again it talks to the fact that the market is bigger than most expected and and is growing more rapidly. Um Johnny made a comment during um his part about the fact that you know New Jo Jersey now it's becoming a bit of a trend that it's gross margin yields are yielding higher than our other states. And you know we look we look at the reasons behind that. And as he said, some of it's some variance, but but some of it is definitely some differences in player behaviour in terms of that slightly more mature market now because it's been open a bit longer, players gravitating to the higher margin products, the same game parlays, the player props, etcetera. And we think again that's a positive trend for us because it shows that they're moving into the let's call it the sweet spot for point step because this is where we aim to lead in terms of having the most engaging um product set. Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Stout from S I G. Please go ahead. Uh good morning everyone. Um you know you Sam, you talked about New Jersey, you know, Indiana and Michigan were, you know, the states the bigger states that you have exposure to in the third quarter where you lost share, but um I guess the expectation, rightfully, wrongfully, is it would take a while to build those back given the advertising and the promotional uh environment. But you're able to rebuild in Michigan and I was wondering, can you describe or talk about, you know, maybe some of the methods that you use to to recapture some of that lost share in the fourth quarter ver I'm sorry, in the um fiscal second quarter versus the first quarter? That's the first question. And then I wanted um to ask about customer acquisition costs. Um Johnny you had mentioned you you guys are still uh running about five hundred dollars or so. And with your newer launch states in Virginia and Pennsylvania in a month or you know in February and and New York and your ability to rely on your RSNs, your NBC RSNs, would it be fair to assume that that customer acquisition costs could come down in those particular markets? Yeah, hi Joe. Um so in terms of Michigan, look again, I think the pleasing thing for Michigan, yes, our sports betting market share did go up, but again, even more importantly, you I think we had seven hundred thousand of net win last quarter and this quarter was something like three point two million. So again, really good growth in Michigan from a net a net win perspective. Um you know I think obviously when you've got the casino products improving, uh you know, when we when we think about states that have a mix of sports betting and i gaming, you really do have to look at them in in in totality because it goes without saying that if a client um goes and loses some money playing blackjack, well then that's perhaps less money than they have to turn over on sports betting. So the two are are generally related and thus when you're looking at New Jersey, uh Michigan and and soon to be West Virginia and Pennsylvania and states with with mix, you have to look at the combined result um not you know, with there there's a difference with you just have sports betting to to having sports betting uh and eye gaming. Johnny, is there anything you'd want to say about um Michigan in particular? I'll just add Sam that e again we view every state as a state as its own uh country and and each state sort of differs in terms of the dynamics and how again consumers consume sport, the population by distribution. You know, a market like Michigan is very unique and and in particular, you know, we're seeing I guess the early results of our a very smart investment with um a uh Olympia Entertainment. So they um own theed arena where the Pistons and the Red Wings play. We made a smart investment into building a sports bar next to the main entrance of the stadium and when you've got at least eighty two home games of MBA NHL and people are walking past the Points Fifth brand going in and out of the arena and going there and having a drink. It's played a role in making sure the Points Bet's part of the local sporting fabric there and part of the consideration when people in Michigan and Detroit are thinking about where to place their next bet or sign up. Thanks, Johnny. Yeah. In terms of the CAC Joe, I mean yeah, we spent and we and Johnny made a comment about this, we spent twenty s twenty nine point seven million on marketing and last quarter was similar in terms of um because we were waiting to launch in vet in in Virginia and we knew that we had upcoming launches and we were waiting but but you know quietly confident of a positive outcome in New York and again a confident of a positive outcome with licensing in Pennsylvania. It's been a strange couple of quarters because a a fair chunk of our marketing budget has gone into the Washington R and C N the the Philly R S N and and S N Y New York. So as those states go live, Virginia, now New York and and soon Pennsylvania, you know, that that spend goes from being sort of out of state to to being in live states. And so that proportion of let's call it somewhat of spend that was going outside and maybe less efficient. Yes, it was building the brand and and warming those states up. That then comes in state. So I don't necessarily I wouldn't necessarily say that CACs are going to come down because we're now um going um you know live into those states. But we certain certainly do believe that those it's it's the the model that we've used obviously in in Chicago that um yeah we're never gonna outspend these big guys at the moment but you know the audience watches live sport, you know we've got Phil Lee's seventy sixes, all the teams that Johnny spoke about, the Mets in in in New York, etc., um getting in front of those eyeballs through those RSNs. Thank you. The next question comes from Desmond Sau from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Um I've just got a couple of questions around slide uh fourteen and fifteen. I think you guys provided some interesting detail uh on those two slides. Um, you know, obviously I think Mark noted a couple of industry first achievements by the business in the US and obviously now with Bannek and the rise of in play. I was wondering if you can just talk a bit more about the opportunity that in play presents and then more specifically whether you have a sense of market share within in play. You know, would it be fair to say that your share of the in play market is actually far greater than the blended four point two percent share that you talked to today? Yeah good question. Um yeah I think in terms of the opportunity, you know I want I really want this to be clear in terms of stepping through the dynamics of the US market. Um you know we've we've been at at a disadvantage because we didn't come from an eye gaming background. Most of the companies that we're competing against New Jersey legalized eye gaming back in something like 2013. So all of most of our competitors have been operating eye gaming in America in one state at least and maturing all of their products and practices for some time, you know, pre-PASPA being repealed. Um add to that, as I said, the fact that we took the time to build our own platform because we want it, we want to own it, we want to keep the margin for the long term. You know, we have been at a competitive disadvantage from a product set perspective, but also from a revenue perspective of of not having had um having had that product. But as we think about, you know, forward looking states, you know, I think it i needs to be clear that all the states that are going live now and launching are all sports betting only. So high gaming expertise is not going to necessarily get you get you anywhere if you don't have sports betting expertise. And our obviously our blueprint is to win our market share on the back of our sports bidding expertise and then when i gaming does get legalised, you know, two years later or three years later for a particular state, we've already got um hundreds of thousands of clients and we can cross sell forty percent of them, whatever that number is, to IGaming, versus you know, someone who was focused on I gaming, well, they won't have any market share. Um if they don't have Petroclear Sports Bedding product, um they're they're not going to win that market share in those sports betting states. But within you know that earning of market share from sports betting, I don't think there's there's any operators out there that aren't talking about a seventy five percent in play uh market. Uh so so everyone's everyone's agreeing that seventy five percent of sports bets will be placed in play and you know we're on a path to we believe leading um within that sector. Now we want to lead within the entire product sector. So we want to have the best product full stop and that includes you know improving our gaming product. Um but you know leading the way and now starting to deliver on um some of our product vision. Part of the challenge when you build something from scratch, you know, we built we've built this tech stack from scratch, even in Australia and you know, at at the start with not a lot of resources, is it takes time to d to deliver things. Um and we've now getting to the point where um you know we've we're delivering, you know, we're starting to innovate as you know a hundred percent uptime in, play in play same game parlay, etcetera. So when it comes to, you know, the in play vision and how important it's going to be for winning market share and ultimately succeeding in the US, I don't think anyone's in in in doubt with that. And and I hope you know um the market is starting to see how points bet um is already leading in this category but he's gonna put the foot down and continue to um you know to really um put a gap on there. Um in terms of market share, in play market share. I'll throw it I'll throw to Johnny, but I would just say perhaps, you know, I I think it's still a customer journey, and that's what we were talking about from the from the New Jersey perspective. That, you know the market is still very focused on the promos, etc. It'll it'll gradually gravitate to being more product focused. And then there's the second part to that is though as clients get a little bit more sophisticated as we're seeing in New Jersey and they branch away from the core bet types into, you know, uh more creative bet types and higher margin uh bet types. But Johnny, do you have a feel for whether you believe we're already over indexing from an in play perspective? Yeah Sam, I think I I think the true sort of read through will be um sort of sort of Q three and onwards this quarter and onwards. And the reason being there that yeah again in Q two we we saw NFL and NBA move on to our our uh internal trading feeds powered by uh the banner technology. And so now sort of for each quarter ahead we'll get a true read of of the power that drives. You know, one of the things I think is misunderstood by um the market is that it isn't just about competing for in play on the number of markets you have. Um, it isn't just about building player props and micro markets. Really the core tenant of offering an in play experience that drives repeat uh usage and allows you to lean in on on your product over sort of again sort of covering uh maybe with gaps in your product with heavier sort of promotions. Centers around being up are the longest. Again, you know, sort of aiming towards that zero sort of betting suspensions and giving consumers that complete experience to place a bet, to cash out their bet, uh without again um you know, the moment when the markets are sus are suspended. And then the second tenant is around the speed to accept the bet. Again, you know, we sort of know that our competition in general applies seven to ten second bet delay um when any in play bet is placed. And then after that seven and ten seconds passes and the bet is then um pinged again to the trading uh software that's being used externally by a lot of our competitors, fifty percent of the time the bet's being uh rejected due to a price change or again uh due to the market being suspended. Again, you know, we're uh again actively working and sort of backing in the models um that have been delivered by Bannock, sort of backing in again the pricing efficiency that we have, that we have the confidence to continu to uh continue to put as many clients as we can on zero bet delay. And so not only matching again, as I said, that that sort of um you know sort of uptime goal to again continue to increase that, but also accepting bets um, you know, in sort of lightning speed. And if we're up the longest and quickest to accept, we think that combined with our product features and then the again distribution of the message of Points Bet being uh the king of in play, particularly across C M B C platforms, again is gonna be a huge ongoing driver of client activity for the business. Great. Thanks Sam. Thanks Johnny. Appreciate it. That's all for me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Larry Gandler from Credit Swiss. Please go ahead. I think uh a few questions for me. Um Sam just in New Jersey, uh I you know, hearing how you guys evolved um, you know, the management of that uh offering there. Um can you talk to whether that involved a churn of customers or is it did you migrate existing customers into new patterns? Um how that'd play out? And is this a sort of first state? How come you didn't sort of take this approach in Illinois yet? Is it just a different s circumstance there? Okay, Larry. Um yeah, I think across the across the business, you know, we made a comment and I think Johnny referenced it again that last quarter we probably didn't focus enough on our existing clients or our higher quality clients and um with our with our promotions and focused on you know the acquisition period and I think you know we we we do want to focus on quality clients uh without wanting to yeah everyone's got their own strategies but you know there's a acquiring clients um is not hard. You know we c we can run promotions and um give away money and just acquire clients, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of those clients are going to be of of value. So we're trying to find the the balance um and I think that's the message you know coming out that yes, um we we'll keep growing, but we want to keep growing um responsibly. Um so if you know adding another ten thousand actives or twenty thousand actives if those actives are are no good and that then that's the same in terms of churn, there's no point trying to hold on to some clients if they're just they're just genuinely not not genuine. Um then then you know we make we make no uh apologies for for doing that. So no I wouldn't I wouldn't sort of say that we're actively um you know targeting um segments or you know disconnecting from certain segments apart from unprofitable segments. You know clients that are just not going to be worth anything. Uh and in terms of Illinois, no, it's it's very similar. Um it's it's it's very similar, the strategy's the same. Yeah, it's about it's about a focus on value, continuing to grow. It's just the dynamics work out that in in New Jersey we grew revenue by that twenty four percent um quarter on quarter, lost a bit of market share. Um in Illinois we're able to continue growth without losing that market share, but the s the strategy is consistent. Okay, excellent there. And um with New Jersey, just continuing on that, um I think it did about fifteen million of net win in the half. Let's say we annualize that and a bit more. New Jersey's been funding um marketing for new states, but if we kinda withdraw that new state support, um are we getting it close to break even in New Jersey alone if you sort of isolate just New Jersey marketing? Yeah, I think I think we are, uh Larry. Yeah, I mean I think would we do ten point eight for the quarter, I would rather times that by four, um, because the eye gaming product has come in and that wasn't necessarily um present in in in previous quarters. You know, there's a few there's a lot happening in New Jersey. There's a lot of market dynamics still there, so I'll I'll call out a few. You know, obviously going live in New York and being um one of an exclusive group that will be live in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will be helpful going live in Pennsylvania. We spoke to that that Philly audience. The continued growth of the eye gaming products um is going to be vitally important. But, you know I, think um I think by the middle of next year, um, you know, we think New Jersey s is turning profitable. So um, you know, post the the PESPA cessation of sports, you know, sport came back middle of post COVID in the middle of two thousand twenty, sort of had to restart the business. And so, you know, we think by the end of next financial year we're we're turning profitable. Okay, agree. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Don Carducci from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Morning everyone. So just a couple quick ones from me. So if I think about the net new active customers, where did they they come from? Uh was it the new markets or was it maybe those markets that you had been in for twelve months or more? Hi Don. Yeah, I mean look obviously we acquire clients in all in all new markets. The difference being that in a market like New Jersey where you have been uh live for some time you also churn clients out out the back end. So the increase in active clients is a is a net effect. It's what you've added, obviously the increase we've acquired more first time betters than that increase in actives, but we've also churned some clients in the back end. So that's the that's the net the net effect. Yeah, no, g got it. Uh understand that. So I guess if I rephrase the question, I mean you you have churn. Is the majority of this churn coming from new states, or is it coming from the existing states that you've been in for twelve months or more, like New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana. Yeah, no, by by the definition, because we're giving a twelve month rolling number, it has to be states that we've been live in for more than twelve months. Because if we've been live in six in in um a state for six months, for example, um all of those clients would be in the twelve month active number. Gotcha. And then can you give us a little bit of clarity on the the cash burn guidance maybe for next quarter? Um include you know license payments, eteracet. Obviously Pennsylvania, that's a that's a steep one, uh New Jersey, but just kind of a little bit of guidance on what we should expect for that. Yeah, sure, Don Sandy. You know, I think in just talk to to Cashburn generally, you know, we're continuing to build obviously for the long term and investing in this opportunity, particularly in the US and and the product. And that is requiring a reasonable level of upfront investment. As you mentioned, the the market access requirements, licing requirements, and the marketing investment, which I think it's pretty pretty well understood as we roll out into new states. As it relates to the market access payment. Obviously this was a a large payment that we made in New York, which was twenty five million US in Q two. Um the payment required for Pennsylvania uh is eleven million US dollars which will be which will be paid in Q three. So the business development payments for for Q three will be lower than than Q two. Gotcha. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

      "baseline" : "Thank you, Darcy, and welcome everyone to our December quarterly analyst call. December quarterly production showed a considerable improvement on the September quarter with record production throughput and improving grades, improving recoveries and improving cash flow. Unfortunately, delays accessing higher grade parts of the open pit resulted in lower grades than projected in our gardens. On the exploration front, today we announced a 70% increase in our 100% owned Yamana resources. So they now sit at 0.5 million ounces. In the presentation today, we will be referring to the quarterly results slides that can be viewed on the live webcast, our website, or the ASX release. Those on the webcast are now also able to submit a question for us to address at the end of this call. On the call today we have Duncan Gibbs, Managing Director and CEO, Don Malumby, our recently appointed CFO, Andrew Tyrrell, General Manager of Discovery, and Haven Barcoff, our company secretary and GM of corporate development. I'll now hand over to Duncan Gibbs to talk you through our quarterly results in more detail. Thanks, Duncan, and thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. As Duncan's just indicated, the December quarter sh quarterly saw improvements across the board. Production total sixty-seven eight hundred and thirteen uh ounces uh produced at through yeah for the quarter, the best quarterly production in twenty twenty one. All in sustaining cost was fifteen twenty six dollars per ounce for the quarter, lower quarter on quarter, but higher than anticipated due to lower health production than forecast. Pleasingly our twelve month lost time injury frequency rate continues to fall, ending the quarter at 2.3. Next to good cash flow generation during the quarter, our cash and equivalence list lifted the one hundred and thirty five point five million. Gold Road continues to carry no debt. We continue to make good progress on the expiration funds with terragen signs seen from several targets tested on a hundred percent owned Southern Project area at Yamana. The cord also saw us grow a hundred percent owned Yamana resources to half a million ounces, with the majority of these resources in the Southern Project area. Now turning to the quarterly in a little more detail, Bristol Material Movement increased again quarter on quarter by point three million tonnes. The total rate of oil mining lifted again to record highs and an annual equivalent of twelve point seven million tonnes per annum. The mine grade lifted in the December quarter, but not as much as we had expected, reflecting a delay in accessing some of the high grade parts of the stage two pit. The delayed progress was in part due to challenging challenges in rostering key plastic personnel, combined with some short term interruption from clever weather in December. Processing rates continue to uh uh rise to an equivalent annualized rate of eight point nine million tonnes per annum despite the restructions to the bull mill that we uh reported early in the quarter. Overall plant utilization lifted to ninety-one percent. Metallurgical recoveries also improved in line with the higher headgrades and less processing interruptions. Head rate was up, but over to the lower than expected nine grade was lower than we expected, resulting in anticipated quarterly production and annual production falling slightly short of guidance. As a result of that, our our attributable all in sustaining cost going slightly above guidance. Uh gold ounces sold lifted quarter on quarter to thirty five four hundred and sixty ounces, an average price of two thousand three hundred and nine dollars per ounce. Delivery in the forward sales was product was approximately twenty five percent of our uh production in a quote. Our oil in sustain sorry, our corporate oil in cost was lower this quarter at uh nineteen twenty four dollars per ounce. In line with our three year production outlo outlook that we put out a year ago, our production will continue to improve in twenty twenty two. Annual production will increase to a forecast range of 300 to 340,000 ounces or 150 to 170,000 ounces attributable. Lower all-in-sustaining cost is guided between twelve seventy and fourteen seventy dollars per ounce. We view our guidance as incorporating an appropriate allowance for operational issues, which we expect to have less of in twenty twenty-two. That said, we have not allowed for major force majeure events, extended impacts, including those from COVID-19 or other issues. Improved production is driven by increasing grades through stage two and three PIPs, as shown in the image here, with grade lifting through the year, increasing throughput rate as previously communicated in our three-year outlook. Quarter one includes two plant shutdowns, a reline of the tack mill and a reline of the bull mill with lower plan utilization in this quarter. Our opportunity use of the rehandle fleet, as we've seen in the December quarter, is likely to continue into 2022, with most movement being brought forward from future years, which has been factored into our all-end sustaining cost guidance. Bringing forward this total material movement allows for greater processing flexibility and it provides a buffer to some of the industry headquarters currently being expected in Western Australia, including labour availability, supply chain concerns, and potential covert related staffing disruptions to mining. Drilling beliefs the green air resource was completed during the quarter. Assay results are still awaited for three holes. Well results are received a full assessment of the updated geological model the undertaken before determining our next steps. You'll note from this long section shows the September 2021 Oil Reserve, a 1.1 million ounce increase. The long section also shows the Operit Mineral Resource as it was communicated in December twenty twenty, and the underground resource as communicated at february twenty twenty one. Both of these resources will be updated as part of an annualised reporting cycle in february twenty twenty two. We anticipate seeing a transition between the open fit and underground resources pushing deeper given the steep and pit slopes reported in the uh recent reserve update. Referring to the next slide, uh we move on and look at our uh balance sheets and cash position. We remain debt free and cash and equivalence lift is 135.5 million. In October we paid a fully frank dividend for the six months to the 30th of June twenty twenty-one. The cash flow waterfall summarises the movements of cash equivalence over the quarter. It is worth noting the gain on a short investment with Apollo consolidated during the quarter of three point six million. Pre-cash flow was fifteen point seven million before the gain on Apollo shares and payment of the interim. Thanks Duncan. Uh the Discovery team continue to focus their efforts on systematic and targeted exploration over the priority prospects within the southern project area of the Yamana project. In twenty twenty one, the team achieved a significant amount of drilling with over 155,000 meters of air core, 36,000 meters of RC, and 8,000 meters of diamond completed. While exploration made encouraging progress from prospects such as Earl, Waffler, Avados and Warbler, as with most of the exploration sector, we are still awaiting assay results from most of the drilling completed in the December quarter. However, early results received today have been encouraging. A budget of $30 million has been allocated to the Discovery Project for 2022, which is slightly less than the final 2021 budget spend. 2022 will see an increased rate of R C and diamond drilling as the company focuses on deeper drill testing for these numerous regular gold anomalies and mineralized trends defined by Aircorps and R C in the last six to twelve months. There is currently an R C rig on site as I speak and a Dino rig will be remobilizing shortly. A further two aircraft rigs are also expected soon. Today we announced a seventy percent increase in our one hundred percent owned demand of resources. They now total half a million ounces at an average grade of 2.44 grams per tonne gold and include an increase to the Gilmour resource of 40,000 ounces, which includes a small underground component, 45% of the Gilmour resource reports to the indicated category at a healthy grade of six point five five grams per tonne of gold. Maiden inferred open pit resources declared for smoke, bush, and warbler, and an increase of thirty thousand ounces at the Renegade resource located just north of the Golden Highway. As you will note, the bulk of the resources are located in close proximity to each other in the Southern Project area and show potential to be incorporated into any future standalone processing operation in this area. Looking at the Southern Projects area in a little more detail now, we continue to push forward with our exploration efforts within this area. Activities completed in the Southern Projects area have highlighted several very encouraging and large areas of regular anomalism and favorable geology. From this several priority targets are emerging, in particular these include at Waffler, we completed an RT program at this four kilometer long Regulus anomaly and are still awaiting most of these results. In addition, we completed another phase of Air Corps at Waffler that continues to show strong drilling results in the regulars, which leads to f beollowed up with further RC drilling in twenty twenty two. Follow up RC drilling at the Earl Target, located southeast of Smoke Bush, along with Smokebush Shearzone, has returned some encouraging results, and these include 17. metres at 127 grams gold, 15 metres at 1.18 grams of tongue gold, and 10 meters at 1.05 grams. Further work will include more plant RT and bun drilling. At Abydos, a programme of RT drilling was commenced in the December quarter designed to test beneath a a four kilometer long Regular anomaly with results still pending. The R C programme will recommence uh early in early February of this year. At Warbler we completed a programme of RC drilling along strike northwest of the Maiden Resource. Drilling intersected the same sequence of rocks with similar encouraging alteration observed. FA results are still awaited. And finally, at Kingston and at the Deepwood Camp, Gold Road intends to complete infill air core drilling to better understand the large anomalies defined in this area by air core drilling in twenty twenty one. That brings a close to the expression update. I look forward to any additional questions you may have. I will now hand back to Duncan Hughes. Thanks and June Duncan. So that brings a close to the results presentation. I would now be very happy to answer any questions you may have and I'll hand the call back to Darcy. Thank you. Did you wish to ask a question via the phone, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speaker phone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. If you wish to ask a question via webcast, please enter it into the ask a question box and click submit. We have no phone questions at this time. Okay, well perhaps we'll start with some web pass questions and return to see whether there's any phone questions at a later date. The first question comes from Robert. Who's the current leadership of Exploration? Andrew Cyril is our exploration manager as or sorry, our general manager of exploration and he ran through the expiration uh announcement on the uh on the call. Uh our expiration manager is currently James Davids, uh someone we've promoted internally, so he has the right level of expertise as well to hold that role. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jemka, is when do you expect more returns to be delivered to shareholders? Uh well I think Gold Road has a strong track record of uh creating uh returns to shareholders uh particularly since the inception of the company. Uh of course we're one of the few companies that have come up into production and pay a dividend uh and no debt. And uh you know having commenced pay a dividend I expect to uh keep doing that. And uh I think the expiration results that we've uh we've got at the moment are quite encouraging. Obviously still not there yet in be able to develop a second mining operation or half a million ounces but uh you know some of the uh scale of the GM anomalies that will be actively RC and Bowen Trail testing this year uh put us in a pretty good shape to uh progress those forward and with the objective of developing a second mining operation. Another question from uh Michael from uh Euros, Hartleys. Could you please outline the expected grade and throughput for calendar year twenty twenty two to reach guidance? I'll give you rough numbers, Michael. So you'd be looking at throughput as somewhere between nine and nine point five million tons and grey between one point one and one point two. Um that should should get us there. Um I think as we outlined in the quarterly it's worth noting that um this quarter that we're in now because we're doing mill relines will be softer and the the gray hand throughput will progressively increase through the calendar year. Question from uh Robert. Seafood was looking very promising. What's its current status? Uh beef wood is a bit of an enigma. It is obviously a quite a sizable GA chemical anomaly that sits there in both Regulus and uh in Saprolite, lower saprollite. We continue to try to understand, I guess, the source of that and we will that's why we plan our program thisme year to to try to to vector into where we think the source of that that gold may be. A question from Tom. What is the company guiding in terms of gold price for twenty twenty two and its policy on hedging? Yeah look we don't and um gold producers don't put out guidance on uh on gold price in terms of our hedge book. Uh really our hedgebook runs through to the end of this year. It represents about twenty-five percent of production and the strategy at the moment is basically to deliver into those gold hedges that they prefer due. The general principle of what we do around hedging really is around risk management and the hedging that we took on was really put in place when we knew we had to draw down some debt for uh the construction of Gruyere, obviously with the gold price being substantially uh higher um since the development of Gruyere than what was projected at the time of construction uh and when we're in that financing phase uh we ultimately paid down uh our debt facilities a lot faster than uh than the model at that point in time. So uh what you can really expect to see uh barring some need for uh for drawing down debt to grow the business is that we'll continue to deliver into those hedges as they forget. Question now from Sabrina. When will a decision be made as to whether a dividend will be paid for the December twenty one half? Uh the uh announcement of every dividend obviously follows the um final audited accounts and the announcement of those accounts. So you'd expect it to come out after our financials are formally reported and then the board is able to determine the Our annual results will be released in the last week of March, along with our sustainability report. A question from Scott Is the company still active in the M and A area? Yeah, look I think it's no uh secret we've uh looked at lots of opportunities. Uh obviously uh you know Tropicana well publicized uh and also the more recent uh have a l look at Apollo. Uh I guess we've also accessed you know exercised discipline in what we're prepared to pay. Um so uh you know we're still looking for opportunities, but I guess we're also quite disciplined about uh they've got to create value for shareholders, not just getting a transaction done. So thank you all for your webcast questions. That's the first time we've um we've done that, and I think that worked really well. There's a few other questions I know that we haven't had time to answer on this call. Uh we'll endeavour to answer those and we'll get back to you on those questions in due course. Um I'll just quickly check in with Darcy if there are any questions from the from the phone. Otherwise um please hand back to me, Darcy. Thank you. We do have a question from Paul Kainer from Aud Minute. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi gents. Thanks thanks for taking my question. J just on your twenty two guidance, uh when we have a look at that compared to your previous three year guidance which you which you put out in in February of last year, there's there's about a nine to ten percent increase in your oral sustaining costs. Could you could you maybe talk specifically what is driving this this Delta increase and and how much is related to inflationary uh increases? Yeah, so I think that you're saying there, Paul, no uh fake secret that um uh you know WA is experiencing higher costs. Um so we've obviously factored those in. um I'd also say they're not um particularly sort of astronomical. Uh so sort of a few percent is what you need to be considering around kind of CPI type levels. But the other thing probably of note, which I did make commentary on uh during the presentation, is that we're pulling forward mining volumes and we're doing that quite consciously, really as a risk mitigation strategy around you know la sbourhortages and delays from COVID or or other of those kind of events. Um now of course how that exactly pans out during the year um will depend on whether any of those of those risks eventuate. But of course over the life of mine we're not actually spending more money, it's it's purely an offset spending that this year rather than in future years in in accelerating that that waste movement. Uh so we think that's a prudent strategy to really mitigate mining related risks to production, but it does have a consequence of contributing to higher all in sustaining costs during this year. The other slight impact on that Paul as well is um production guidance in terms of ounces is down very slightly on our uh initial outlook and that again is just driven by slightly slower progress into those improved gap rates. So obviously with slightly lower ounces uh all in sustaining costs per ounce is impacted. Yeah, no I understood. And and just to remind me again on the uh uh the stockpiles you have on site at the moment as a sort of another contingency to these labour pressures that we're seeing? Yeah. Uh look I don't have the exact number but I'm in order a magnitude uh three three and a half million tons of total stockpiles, they're obviously of lower uh uh grade on average than the um the ROM grade. Um so uh you know they provide a uh a bit buffer in terms of be able to keep the mill going with with any uh you know mining related delays or disruption. But but if we rely on those stockpiles they obviously have a a negative impact on gulp reduce. Yep, perfect. Now that's all from me. Thanks very much. Thanks, Paul. Thank you. There are no further questions on the phone at this time. Thanks, Darcy. So um I'll just close on um slide eleven. Um uh obviously this is just a summary of our quarter. Um it shows, you know, as as we outlined grace and throughput increased, and we're in line with our two year outlook. Gold Roads attributable resources are now lifted to four point seven million ounces thanks to the impact from Yamana. We see continued encouragement at expiration and we're excited now the rigs are returning to site. A balance sheet is strong and I'm very happy that our cash and equivalents grew by quite a considerable amount during the quarter. Thanks everyone for attending and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.",

December quarterly production showed a considerable improvement on the September quarter, with record production throughput and improving grades, improving recoveries, and improving cash flow. Unfortunately, delays accessing higher grade parts of the open pit resulted in lower grades than we projected in our guidance. On the exploration front, today we announced a 70% increase in our 100% owned Yamana resources, so they now sit at .5 million ounces. In the presentation today, we will be referring to the quarterly results slides, that can be viewed on the live webcast at our website, or the ASX release. Those on the webcast are also now able to submit a question for us to address at the end of this call. On the call today, we have Duncan Gibson, Managing Director and CEO, John inaudible, our recently appointed CFO, Andrew Tyrell, General Manager of Discovery, and Hayden inaudible, our company secretary, and GM of Corporate Development. I'll now hand over to Duncan Gibbs, to talk you through our quarterly results in more detail. Thanks Duncan, and thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. As Duncan's just indicated, the December quarters- quarterlies shaw- saw improvements across the board. Production totaled 67,813 uh, ounces, uh, produced at inaudible for the quarter, best quarterly production in 2021. All-in sustaining cost was 15.26 dollars per ounce for the quarter, lower quarter on quarter, but higher than anticipated, due to lower gold production than forecast. Pleasingly, our 12 month lost time injury frequency rate continued to fall, ending the quarter at 2.3. Thanks to good cashflow generation during the quarter, cash and equivalents was lifted to 135.5 million. inaudible continues to carry no debt. We continue to make good progress on the exploration fronts, with encouraging signs seen from several targets tested on 100% owned Southern project area, at Yamana. The quarter also saw us grow 100% owned Yamana resources to half a million ounces, with the majority of these resources in the Southern project area. Concerning inaudible the quarterly, in a little more detail, little material movement, increased again, quarter on quarter, by about, like, three million tons. Uh, the total rate of all mining enlisted again, to record highs, and an annual equivalent of 12.7 million tons, per annum. The mine grade listed in the December quarter, inaudible not as much as we antici- expected, reflecting a delay in accessing some of the higher grade parts of the stage two pit. Delayed progress was in part due to challenging- challenges in rostering key blasting personnel, uh, combined with some short term interruption from inclement- inclement weather, in December. The processing rates continue to, uh, rise, to an equivalent annualized rate of 8.9 nine million tons per annum, despite the restructures to the inaudible that we, uh, reported early in the quarter. Overall, plant utilization lifted to 91%. Metallurgical recoveries also improved in line with the higher pit grades, and less processing interruptions. Pit grades- pit grade was up, but owing to the lower than expected mine grade, uh, was lower than we expected, uh, resulting in anticipated quarterly production and annual production falling slightly short of the guidance. As a result of that, uh, error, our attributable all-in sustaining cost come in slightly above guidance. Uh, gold ounces sold lifted quarter on quarter, which is 35, 460 ounces, an average price of $2309 per ounce. Delivery inaudible was approximately 25% of our production in the quarter. Our oil and inaudible, sorry, our corporate oiling cost was lower this quarter, at, uh 19.24 dollars per ounce. Let me put the next slide. Um, in line with our three year production own la- outlook that we put out a year ago, um, our production will continue to improve in 2022. Three year annual production will increase to a forecast range of 300 to 340, uh, thousand ounces, or 150 to 170,000 ounces attributable. Lower oil and sustaining cost is guided between $12.70 and $14.70 per ounce. We feel our guidance is incorporating an appropriate allowance for operational issues, which we expect to have less of, in 2022. That said, we have not allowed for major force majeure events, extended impacts, including those from COVID-19, or other issues. Improved production is driven by increasing grades through the stage two and three pits, as shown in the image here, with grades lifting through the year. An increasing throughput rate, as- as, uh- uh, previously communicated in our three year outlook. Quarter One includes two plant shutdowns, a re-line of the tech mill, and a re-line of the saw mill, with lower plant utilization in this quarter. Our opportunistic use of the inaudible as we've seen at the December quarter, is likely to continue into 2022, with most movement being brought forward from future years, which has been factored into our oil and sustaining cost guidance. Bringing forward these total mem- material movements, uh, allows for greater processing flexibility and provides a buffer for some of the industry headwinds currently being expected in Western Australia, including labor reliability, supply chain concerns, and potential COVID related staffing disruptions to mining. inaudible resources completed during the quarter, assay results are still awaited for three holes. When all results are received, the full assessment with the updated geological model will be undertaken before determining our next steps. You will note, the inaudible section shows the Se- September, uh, 2021 oil reserve at 1.1 million ounce increase, and the long section also shows the upper pit mineral resource, as it was communicated in December of 2020, and the underground resource, as communicated at February 2021. Both of these resources will be updated as part of an annualized reporting cycle, in February 2022. We anticipate seeing, uh, a transition between the open pit and underground resources, pushing deeper, given the second pit slopes, um, reported in the, uh, recent reserve update. Referring to the next slide, uh, if we move on and look at our, uh, our- I want to show you some cash position. Uh, we remain debts free, and cash and equivalents lifted 135.5 million. In October we paid a fully franked dividend for the six months, uh, so the 30th of June, 2021. The cashflow waterfall summarizes the movements of cash equivalents, over the quarter. It is worth noting the gain on a short investment where the inaudible consolidated during the quarter, at 3.6 million. Free cashflow was 15.7 million, before the gain on the follow shares, and payment of the inaudible dividend. I'll now here go, uh, to Andrew, uh, to talk through the exploration update. Thanks, Duncan. Uh, the Discovery team continue to focus their efforts on systematic and targeted exploration over the priority prospects in the Southern project area of the Yamana project. In 2021, the team achieved a significant amount of drilling, with over 155 thousands liters of inaudible, 36,000 liters of inaudible and 8,000 liters of Diamond completed. While exploration made encouraging progress from prospects such as Earl Waffler, inaudible, as with most of the explorations sector, we are still awaiting assay results for most of the drilling completed in the December quarter. However, early results received to date have been encouraging. A budget of $30 million has been allocated to the Discovery project for 2022, which is slightly less than the final 2021 budget stands. 2022 will see an increased rate of RC and diamond drilling, as the company focuses on deeper drill testing for these numerous regular inaudible anomalies, and mineralized trends defined by inaudible and RC in the last six to 12 months. There is currently an RT rig on site, as I speak, and a diamond rig will be remobilizing shortly. A further two aircore rigs are expected soon. Today, we announce a 70% increase in our 100% owned Yamana resources. They now total half a million ounces, at an average grade of 2.44 grams to ton gold, and include an increase to the inaudible resource of 40,000 ounces, which includes a small underground component. With that, five percent of the inaudible resources reports to the indicated category, at a healthy grade of 6.55 grams per ton of gold. The maiden inaudible open pit resources declared for inaudible and an increase of 30,000 ounces, at the renegade resource, located just north of the Golden Highway. As you will note, the bulk of the resources are located in close proximity to each other, in the Southern project area, and show potential to be incorporated into any future standalone processing operations in this area. Looking at the Southern project area in a little more detail now, we continue to push forward with our exploration assets within this area. Activities completed in the Southern project area have highlighted several very encouraging and large areas of regular inaudible and febrile geology. From this, several priority targets are emerging, in particular these include, at inaudible, we completed an RT program, at the four kilometer long inaudible anomaly, and are still awaiting most of these results. In addition, we completed another phase of aircore at inaudible that continues to show strong drilling results in the inaudible, which needs to be followed up with further RT drilling in 2022. Follow-up RT drilling at the inaudible located southeast of Smokebush, along the Smokebush shear zone, has result- returned some encouraging results, and these include 17 meters at 1.27 grams gold, 15 meters at 1.18 grams per ton gold, and 10 meters at 1.05 grams. Further work will include more planned RC and inaudible drilling. At inaudible, a program of RC drilling was commenced in the December quarter, designed to test beneath a four kilometer long inaudible anomaly, with results still pending. The RC program will recommence, uh, early- in early February of this year. At Warbler, we completed a program of RT drilling, along strike the north beds of the Maiden resource. Drilling intersected the same sequence of rocks with similar incursion alteration observed. Assay results are still awaited. And finally, at Kingston, at the inaudible camp, Gull Road intends to complete insular aircore drilling, to better understand the large anomalies defined in this area by aircore drilling in 2021. That brings a close to the exploration update, I look forward to any additional questions you may have. I will now hand back to Duncan Hughes. Thanks Andrew and Duncan, so that brings a close to the results presentation. Uh, we'd now be very happy to answer any questions, uh, you may have, and I'll hand the call back to Darcy. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question via the phone, please press * 1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press * 2. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. If you wish to ask a question via webcast, please enter it into the Ask A Question box, and click submit. We have no phone questions at this time. Okay, well, perhaps we'll start with some webcast questions and return to see whether there's any phone questions, at a later date. Fir- first question comes from Robert, um, Who is the current leadership of Exploration? Uh, Andrew Tyrell is our Exploration Manager, um, as- or, sorry, uh, General Manager of Exploration, uh, and he ran through the Exploration, uh, announcement on the, uh, on the call. Uh, yeah, and, uh, our Exploration Manager is currently Jane inaudible, uh, someone we promoted internally, uh, who has the right level of expertise as well, to- to hold that role. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jemka, is, When do you expect more returns to be delivered to shareholders? Uh- uh, well, I think Gull Road has a strong track record of, uh, creating, uh, returns to shareholders, uh, te- particularly since the inception of the company. Uh, of course we're one of the few companies that have come up into production that pay dividends and no debts, and, uh, you know, having committed to pay a dividend, I would expect to, uh, keep doing that, and, uh, I think the Exploration results that we've, uh, we've got at the moment are quite encouraging, obviously. Still not there yet in being able to develop a second mining operation, or a half million ounces, but, uh, you know, some of the, uh, scale of the inaudible anomalies that will be actively RC and diamond drill testing this year are p- put us in a pretty good shape, to, uh, progress those forward, and with the objective of developing a second mining operation. We have a question from, uh, Michael, from, uh, inaudible. Could you please outline the expected grade and throughput for calendar year 2022, to reach guidance? Um, I'll give you rough numbers. Um, Michael, so, you'd be looking at throughput of somewhere between nine and 9.5 million tons, and grade between 1.1 and 1.2. Um, that should- should get us there. Um, I think as we outlined in the quarterly, it's worth noting that, um, this quarter that we're in now, because we're doing mill re-lines will be softer, and, uh, the grade and throughput will progressively increase through the calendar year. Question from, uh, Robert, inaudible was looking very promising. What's its current status? Uh, Leafwood is a bit of an enigma, it is up to quite a sizeable geochem anomaly, that's it's inaudible both regulus and, uh, inaudible low inaudible, we continue to try to understand, I guess, the source of that, and we will- that's why we plan a program this year, to- to obviously try to- to factor into where we think the source of that- that gold may be. A question from Tom. What is the company guiding in terms of gold price for 2022, and its policy on hedging? Yeah, look, we don't- and, uh, gold producers don't put out guidance on, uh, on gold price. In terms of our hedge book, uh, really, our hedge book runs through to the end of this year, it represents about 25% for production and the strategy at the moment is basically to deliver into those gold hedges, inaudible, uh, the general principle of, uh, what we do around hedging, uh, really is around risk management and the hedging that we took on, uh, was really put in place when we knew we had to draw down some debt, for, uh- for the construction of inaudible. Obviously with the gold price being substantially, uh, higher, um, since the development of inaudible, than what was projected at the time of construction, and when we're in that financing phase, uh, we ultimately paid down, uh, our debt facilities a lot faster than, uh, than- than inaudible at that point in time, so what you can really expect to see, uh, you know, barring some need for, uh, for drawing down debts to grow the business, is that we'll continue to deliver inaudible. Question now, from Sabrina. When will a decision be made as to whether a dividend will be paid for the December ' 21 half? Uh, the, uh, announcement of every dividend, obviously follows the, um, final orders to the accounts, and the announcement of those accounts. So, you'd expect it to come out after our financials, uh, are formally reported, uh, and then the board is able to determine, um, the dividends at that point in time. Our annual results will be, released in the last week of March, along with our sustainability report. A question from Scott. Is the company still active in the M&A area? Yeah, look, I mean, it's no, uh, secret, we've, uh, looked at lots of opportunities, uh, inaudible, you know, Tropicana, well publicized. Uh, and also the more recent, uh, inaudible look at Apollo. Uh, I guess we've also accessed- you know, exercised discipline, in what we're prepared to pay. Um, so, uh, you know, we're still looking for opportunities, but, I guess we're also quite disciplined about, uh, if they're going to create money for shareholders, not just getting a transaction done. Uh, thank you all for your webcast questions, that's the first time we've, um, we've done that, and I think that worked really well. There's a few other questions, I know, that we haven't had time to answer on this call. Uh, we'll endeavor to answer those, uh, we'll get back to you on those questions in due course. Um, I'll just quickly check in with Darcy, if there are any questions from the- from the phone, otherwise, um, please hand back to me, Darcy. Thank you, we do have a question from Paul Kaner, from inaudible. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi James, thanks- thanks for taking my question. Ju- just on your ' 22 guidance, uh, when we have a look at that, compared to your previous three year guidance, which you- which you put out in- in February of last year, there's- there's about a nine to 10% increase in your oil and sustaining costs. Could you- could you inaudible talk specifically what is driving this- this delta increase? And- and how much is related to inflationary, uh, increases? Yeah, so I think that you're saying that, Paul, no, uh, state secret, but, um, uh, you know, RBI is experiencing higher costs, um, so we've obviously factored those in. Um, the- I'd also say they're not, um, particularly astronomical, uh, so sort of a few percents is what you need to be considering around kind of CPI top levels. Uh, the other thing, probably, of note, which I think my commentary on, uh, during the presentation, is that we're pulling forward mining volumes, uh, and we're doing that quite consciously, really, as a risk mitigation strategy, around, you know, labor shortages, and delays from COVID or- or either of those kind of events. Um, now, of course, how that exactly pans out during the year, um, will depend on whether the- any of those risks eventuate. But of course, over the life of the mine, we're not actually spending more money, it's- it's purely an offset, spending that this year, rather than in future years, and- and accelerating that- that inaudible movement. Uh, so we think that's a prudent strategy to, uh, really mitigate mining related risks to production, uh, but it does have a consequence of- of contributing to, uh, higher all-in sustaining costs, uh, here in this year. The other slight impact on that, Paul, as well, is, um, production guidance in terms of ounces is down very slightly on our, uh, initial outlook, and that, again, is just driven by slightly slower progress into those improved gap rates, so obviously, with slightly lower ounces, our all-in sustaining cost per ounce is impacted. Yeah, no, understood, and- and just, uh, remind me again, on the, uh- uh, the stockpiles you have on site at the moment, as a sort of another contingency to these labor pressures, obviously. Yeah. Uh, look, I don't have the exact number in front of me. In order of magnitude, uh, three, 3.5 million tons of total stockpiles. There are obviously of lower, uh- uh, grade on average, than the, um, the rum grade, um, so, uh, you know, they provide a, uh, a bit of buffer, in terms of being able to keep the mill going with- with any, uh, you know, mining related delays or disruption, but- but if we rely on those stockpiles, we'll obviously have a- a negative impact on gold produced. Yeah, perfect. Now, that's all from me, thanks very much. Thanks, Paul. Thank you. There are no further questions on the phone at this time. Thanks Darcy. So, um, I'll just close on, um, slide 11. Um, uh, obviously, this is just a summary of our quarter. Um, it shows, you know, as- as we outlined grades and throughput increased, and we're still in line with our two year outlook. Um, gold rose, attributable resources are now lifted to 4.7 million ounces. Um, thanks to the impact from Yamana. Um, we see continued encouragement with exploration, we're excited now, the rigs are returning to site. Um, our balance sheet is strong and I'm very happy that, uh, cash and equivalents grew by quite a considerable amount during the quarter. Thanks everyone for attending, and we look forward to speaking to you again, next quarter.",
      "withCtc" : "Thank you, Darcy, and welcome everyone to our December quarterly analyst call. December quarterly production showed a considerable improvement on the September quarter with record production throughput and improving grades, improving recoveries and improving cash flow. Unfortunately, delays accessing higher grade parts of the open pit resulted in lower grades than projected in our gardens. On the exploration front, today we announced a 70% increase in our 100% owned Yamana resources. So they now sit at 0.5 million ounces. In the presentation today, we will be referring to the quarterly results slides that can be viewed on the live webcast, our website, or the ASX release. Those on the webcast are now also able to submit a question for us to address at the end of this call. On the call today we have Duncan Gibbs, Managing Director and CEO, Don Malumby, our recently appointed CFO, Andrew Tyrrell, General Manager of Discovery, and Haven Barcoff, our company secretary and GM of corporate development. I'll now hand over to Duncan Gibbs to talk you through our quarterly results in more detail. Thanks, Duncan, and thank you everybody for joining us on the call today. As Duncan's just indicated, the December quarter sh quarterly saw improvements across the board. Production total sixty-seven eight hundred and thirteen uh ounces uh produced at through yeah for the quarter, the best quarterly production in twenty twenty one. All in sustaining cost was fifteen twenty six dollars per ounce for the quarter, lower quarter on quarter, but higher than anticipated due to lower health production than forecast. Pleasingly our twelve month lost time injury frequency rate continues to fall, ending the quarter at 2.3. Next to good cash flow generation during the quarter, our cash and equivalence list lifted the one hundred and thirty five point five million. Gold Road continues to carry no debt. We continue to make good progress on the expiration funds with terragen signs seen from several targets tested on a hundred percent owned Southern Project area at Yamana. The cord also saw us grow a hundred percent owned Yamana resources to half a million ounces, with the majority of these resources in the Southern Project area. Now turning to the quarterly in a little more detail, Bristol Material Movement increased again quarter on quarter by point three million tonnes. The total rate of oil mining lifted again to record highs and an annual equivalent of twelve point seven million tonnes per annum. The mine grade lifted in the December quarter, but not as much as we had expected, reflecting a delay in accessing some of the high grade parts of the stage two pit. The delayed progress was in part due to challenging challenges in rostering key plastic personnel, combined with some short term interruption from clever weather in December. Processing rates continue to uh uh rise to an equivalent annualized rate of eight point nine million tonnes per annum despite the restructions to the bull mill that we uh reported early in the quarter. Overall plant utilization lifted to ninety-one percent. Metallurgical recoveries also improved in line with the higher headgrades and less processing interruptions. Head rate was up, but over to the lower than expected nine grade was lower than we expected, resulting in anticipated quarterly production and annual production falling slightly short of guidance. As a result of that, our our attributable all in sustaining cost going slightly above guidance. Uh gold ounces sold lifted quarter on quarter to thirty five four hundred and sixty ounces, an average price of two thousand three hundred and nine dollars per ounce. Delivery in the forward sales was product was approximately twenty five percent of our uh production in a quote. Our oil in sustain sorry, our corporate oil in cost was lower this quarter at uh nineteen twenty four dollars per ounce. In line with our three year production outlo outlook that we put out a year ago, our production will continue to improve in twenty twenty two. Annual production will increase to a forecast range of 300 to 340,000 ounces or 150 to 170,000 ounces attributable. Lower all-in-sustaining cost is guided between twelve seventy and fourteen seventy dollars per ounce. We view our guidance as incorporating an appropriate allowance for operational issues, which we expect to have less of in twenty twenty-two. That said, we have not allowed for major force majeure events, extended impacts, including those from COVID-19 or other issues. Improved production is driven by increasing grades through stage two and three PIPs, as shown in the image here, with grade lifting through the year, increasing throughput rate as previously communicated in our three-year outlook. Quarter one includes two plant shutdowns, a reline of the tack mill and a reline of the bull mill with lower plan utilization in this quarter. Our opportunity use of the rehandle fleet, as we've seen in the December quarter, is likely to continue into 2022, with most movement being brought forward from future years, which has been factored into our all-end sustaining cost guidance. Bringing forward this total material movement allows for greater processing flexibility and it provides a buffer to some of the industry headquarters currently being expected in Western Australia, including labour availability, supply chain concerns, and potential covert related staffing disruptions to mining. Drilling beliefs the green air resource was completed during the quarter. Assay results are still awaited for three holes. Well results are received a full assessment of the updated geological model the undertaken before determining our next steps. You'll note from this long section shows the September 2021 Oil Reserve, a 1.1 million ounce increase. The long section also shows the Operit Mineral Resource as it was communicated in December twenty twenty, and the underground resource as communicated at february twenty twenty one. Both of these resources will be updated as part of an annualised reporting cycle in february twenty twenty two. We anticipate seeing a transition between the open fit and underground resources pushing deeper given the steep and pit slopes reported in the uh recent reserve update. Referring to the next slide, uh we move on and look at our uh balance sheets and cash position. We remain debt free and cash and equivalence lift is 135.5 million. In October we paid a fully frank dividend for the six months to the 30th of June twenty twenty-one. The cash flow waterfall summarises the movements of cash equivalence over the quarter. It is worth noting the gain on a short investment with Apollo consolidated during the quarter of three point six million. Pre-cash flow was fifteen point seven million before the gain on Apollo shares and payment of the interim. Thanks Duncan. Uh the Discovery team continue to focus their efforts on systematic and targeted exploration over the priority prospects within the southern project area of the Yamana project. In twenty twenty one, the team achieved a significant amount of drilling with over 155,000 meters of air core, 36,000 meters of RC, and 8,000 meters of diamond completed. While exploration made encouraging progress from prospects such as Earl, Waffler, Avados and Warbler, as with most of the exploration sector, we are still awaiting assay results from most of the drilling completed in the December quarter. However, early results received today have been encouraging. A budget of $30 million has been allocated to the Discovery Project for 2022, which is slightly less than the final 2021 budget spend. 2022 will see an increased rate of R C and diamond drilling as the company focuses on deeper drill testing for these numerous regular gold anomalies and mineralized trends defined by Aircorps and R C in the last six to twelve months. There is currently an R C rig on site as I speak and a Dino rig will be remobilizing shortly. A further two aircraft rigs are also expected soon. Today we announced a seventy percent increase in our one hundred percent owned demand of resources. They now total half a million ounces at an average grade of 2.44 grams per tonne gold and include an increase to the Gilmour resource of 40,000 ounces, which includes a small underground component, 45% of the Gilmour resource reports to the indicated category at a healthy grade of six point five five grams per tonne of gold. Maiden inferred open pit resources declared for smoke, bush, and warbler, and an increase of thirty thousand ounces at the Renegade resource located just north of the Golden Highway. As you will note, the bulk of the resources are located in close proximity to each other in the Southern Project area and show potential to be incorporated into any future standalone processing operation in this area. Looking at the Southern Projects area in a little more detail now, we continue to push forward with our exploration efforts within this area. Activities completed in the Southern Projects area have highlighted several very encouraging and large areas of regular anomalism and favorable geology. From this several priority targets are emerging, in particular these include at Waffler, we completed an RT program at this four kilometer long Regulus anomaly and are still awaiting most of these results. In addition, we completed another phase of Air Corps at Waffler that continues to show strong drilling results in the regulars, which leads to f beollowed up with further RC drilling in twenty twenty two. Follow up RC drilling at the Earl Target, located southeast of Smoke Bush, along with Smokebush Shearzone, has returned some encouraging results, and these include 17. metres at 127 grams gold, 15 metres at 1.18 grams of tongue gold, and 10 meters at 1.05 grams. Further work will include more plant RT and bun drilling. At Abydos, a programme of RT drilling was commenced in the December quarter designed to test beneath a a four kilometer long Regular anomaly with results still pending. The R C programme will recommence uh early in early February of this year. At Warbler we completed a programme of RC drilling along strike northwest of the Maiden Resource. Drilling intersected the same sequence of rocks with similar encouraging alteration observed. FA results are still awaited. And finally, at Kingston and at the Deepwood Camp, Gold Road intends to complete infill air core drilling to better understand the large anomalies defined in this area by air core drilling in twenty twenty one. That brings a close to the expression update. I look forward to any additional questions you may have. I will now hand back to Duncan Hughes. Thanks and June Duncan. So that brings a close to the results presentation. I would now be very happy to answer any questions you may have and I'll hand the call back to Darcy. Thank you. Did you wish to ask a question via the phone, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speaker phone, please pick up the handset to ask your questions. If you wish to ask a question via webcast, please enter it into the ask a question box and click submit. We have no phone questions at this time. Okay, well perhaps we'll start with some web pass questions and return to see whether there's any phone questions at a later date. The first question comes from Robert. Who's the current leadership of Exploration? Andrew Cyril is our exploration manager as or sorry, our general manager of exploration and he ran through the expiration uh announcement on the uh on the call. Uh our expiration manager is currently James Davids, uh someone we've promoted internally, so he has the right level of expertise as well to hold that role. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jemka, is when do you expect more returns to be delivered to shareholders? Uh well I think Gold Road has a strong track record of uh creating uh returns to shareholders uh particularly since the inception of the company. Uh of course we're one of the few companies that have come up into production and pay a dividend uh and no debt. And uh you know having commenced pay a dividend I expect to uh keep doing that. And uh I think the expiration results that we've uh we've got at the moment are quite encouraging. Obviously still not there yet in be able to develop a second mining operation or half a million ounces but uh you know some of the uh scale of the GM anomalies that will be actively RC and Bowen Trail testing this year uh put us in a pretty good shape to uh progress those forward and with the objective of developing a second mining operation. Another question from uh Michael from uh Euros, Hartleys. Could you please outline the expected grade and throughput for calendar year twenty twenty two to reach guidance? I'll give you rough numbers, Michael. So you'd be looking at throughput as somewhere between nine and nine point five million tons and grey between one point one and one point two. Um that should should get us there. Um I think as we outlined in the quarterly it's worth noting that um this quarter that we're in now because we're doing mill relines will be softer and the the gray hand throughput will progressively increase through the calendar year. Question from uh Robert. Seafood was looking very promising. What's its current status? Uh beef wood is a bit of an enigma. It is obviously a quite a sizable GA chemical anomaly that sits there in both Regulus and uh in Saprolite, lower saprollite. We continue to try to understand, I guess, the source of that and we will that's why we plan our program thisme year to to try to to vector into where we think the source of that that gold may be. A question from Tom. What is the company guiding in terms of gold price for twenty twenty two and its policy on hedging? Yeah look we don't and um gold producers don't put out guidance on uh on gold price in terms of our hedge book. Uh really our hedgebook runs through to the end of this year. It represents about twenty-five percent of production and the strategy at the moment is basically to deliver into those gold hedges that they prefer due. The general principle of what we do around hedging really is around risk management and the hedging that we took on was really put in place when we knew we had to draw down some debt for uh the construction of Gruyere, obviously with the gold price being substantially uh higher um since the development of Gruyere than what was projected at the time of construction uh and when we're in that financing phase uh we ultimately paid down uh our debt facilities a lot faster than uh than the model at that point in time. So uh what you can really expect to see uh barring some need for uh for drawing down debt to grow the business is that we'll continue to deliver into those hedges as they forget. Question now from Sabrina. When will a decision be made as to whether a dividend will be paid for the December twenty one half? Uh the uh announcement of every dividend obviously follows the um final audited accounts and the announcement of those accounts. So you'd expect it to come out after our financials are formally reported and then the board is able to determine the Our annual results will be released in the last week of March, along with our sustainability report. A question from Scott Is the company still active in the M and A area? Yeah, look I think it's no uh secret we've uh looked at lots of opportunities. Uh obviously uh you know Tropicana well publicized uh and also the more recent uh have a l look at Apollo. Uh I guess we've also accessed you know exercised discipline in what we're prepared to pay. Um so uh you know we're still looking for opportunities, but I guess we're also quite disciplined about uh they've got to create value for shareholders, not just getting a transaction done. So thank you all for your webcast questions. That's the first time we've um we've done that, and I think that worked really well. There's a few other questions I know that we haven't had time to answer on this call. Uh we'll endeavour to answer those and we'll get back to you on those questions in due course. Um I'll just quickly check in with Darcy if there are any questions from the from the phone. Otherwise um please hand back to me, Darcy. Thank you. We do have a question from Paul Kainer from Aud Minute. Please go ahead. Yeah, hi gents. Thanks thanks for taking my question. J just on your twenty two guidance, uh when we have a look at that compared to your previous three year guidance which you which you put out in in February of last year, there's there's about a nine to ten percent increase in your oral sustaining costs. Could you could you maybe talk specifically what is driving this this Delta increase and and how much is related to inflationary uh increases? Yeah, so I think that you're saying there, Paul, no uh fake secret that um uh you know WA is experiencing higher costs. Um so we've obviously factored those in. um I'd also say they're not um particularly sort of astronomical. Uh so sort of a few percent is what you need to be considering around kind of CPI type levels. But the other thing probably of note, which I did make commentary on uh during the presentation, is that we're pulling forward mining volumes and we're doing that quite consciously, really as a risk mitigation strategy around you know la sbourhortages and delays from COVID or or other of those kind of events. Um now of course how that exactly pans out during the year um will depend on whether any of those of those risks eventuate. But of course over the life of mine we're not actually spending more money, it's it's purely an offset spending that this year rather than in future years in in accelerating that that waste movement. Uh so we think that's a prudent strategy to really mitigate mining related risks to production, but it does have a consequence of contributing to higher all in sustaining costs during this year. The other slight impact on that Paul as well is um production guidance in terms of ounces is down very slightly on our uh initial outlook and that again is just driven by slightly slower progress into those improved gap rates. So obviously with slightly lower ounces uh all in sustaining costs per ounce is impacted. Yeah, no I understood. And and just to remind me again on the uh uh the stockpiles you have on site at the moment as a sort of another contingency to these labour pressures that we're seeing? Yeah. Uh look I don't have the exact number but I'm in order a magnitude uh three three and a half million tons of total stockpiles, they're obviously of lower uh uh grade on average than the um the ROM grade. Um so uh you know they provide a uh a bit buffer in terms of be able to keep the mill going with with any uh you know mining related delays or disruption. But but if we rely on those stockpiles they obviously have a a negative impact on gulp reduce. Yep, perfect. Now that's all from me. Thanks very much. Thanks, Paul. Thank you. There are no further questions on the phone at this time. Thanks, Darcy. So um I'll just close on um slide eleven. Um uh obviously this is just a summary of our quarter. Um it shows, you know, as as we outlined grace and throughput increased, and we're in line with our two year outlook. Gold Roads attributable resources are now lifted to four point seven million ounces thanks to the impact from Yamana. We see continued encouragement at expiration and we're excited now the rigs are returning to site. A balance sheet is strong and I'm very happy that our cash and equivalents grew by quite a considerable amount during the quarter. Thanks everyone for attending and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter."

After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question and. answer session To ask a question during the session, you need to press star one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. For any assistance it is star zero. I'd now like to hand the conference over to you for a speaker today, to Mr. Sean Burnock. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. Uh good morning to everyone and thank you for dialing in today. With me on the call is Stephen Wells, our Chief Financial Officer and Virin Virer, our GM of Business Development and Investor Relations. Today, SARA released its December twenty twenty one quarterly results covering operations, market conditions, the Vidalia project, and the outlook for natural graphite, active anode material and its end use market. The fourth quarter and twenty twenty one as a whole was an extraordinarily important period for SIRA, repositioning the company at a transformative point for the industry. Market conditions in the upstream market are the strongest they have been since the Lama's commencement in twenty seventeen, with very strong momentum in demand growth, the existence of supply interruptions, and rising prices for natural graphite. The electric vehicle market has shown remarkable growth through twenty twenty one, with sales doubling year on year to more than six million units, monthly global EV sales exceeding eight hundred thousand units for the first For the first time in December, and global EV penetration reaching approximately 8%. Growth is expected to be sustained, and this is driving significant EV and battery manufacturing expansion announcements and capital programmes in our downstream target markets, and the concurrent gap is evident but in localised supply of input materials in the US and in Europe. SIRES signing during the quarter of a fixed volume and price off take agreement with Tesla for aquivanode material from the Vidal facility in the US marked the importance of SARE's integrated business in potentially starting to fill a part of that gap. And all around the world, governments and markets recognise the key role of critical minerals such as graphite in automotive electrification and energy storage development towards the objective of reducing carbon emissions. Positive ESG differentiation also continues to rise in importance as greater understanding sees challenges in parts of the existing battery materials supply chain. Each quarter we reiterate our belief in the importance of the Balama asset and our vertically integrated active anode material facility at Bedalia to the future of this transition. And as twenty twenty one closed we saw that this is becoming more apparent to customers, investors and governments. Whilst it's disappointing that disruption in the global container shipping industry constrained alarm production and sales in recent months. We have developed a major logistics option to reduce the future impacts and head into twenty twenty two with strong optimism around the Lama's future and the potential for near term FID approval at Bardalia. Slide four reiterates our fundamental ESG commitments and performance focus, and every quarter that passes highlights the criticality of this effort. Since the company's commencement, ESG Excellence has been a key focus and we're beginning to see the very real impact of downstream customer requirements and supply chain auditing bring differentiation between incumbent production and ourselves into sharp relief. During Q four, Minbarro completed a detailed independent life cycle assessment of SARA's integrated operations from Balama origin to Vidalia Active Anode Material Customer Gate in accordance with ISO standards. LCA is a globally recognised and scientifically validated methodology to quantify direct and embodied environmental impacts along the life cycle of a product or process and enVairo is uh an independent third party consultant with an established track record of life cycle assessments in the battery materials space. The approach incorporates all material and energy inputs and direct emissions to air, land and water associated with the production of a product or process and identifies environmental hotspots in the production process via an assessment of an overall global warming potential outcome. Minbaro's LCA estimated that SARA's operations exhibit materially lower global warming potential compared with representative natural graphite and synthetic graphite anode material suppliers benchmarked in China. The company is also advancing specific projects, including the solar and battery system at Vilama, and longer-term power options for Vidalia to further reduce the environmental impacts of its operations. It's worth noting here that a lot of partial chain information is being communicated to the market around LCA. SIRA is committed to making the full chain from mine to final product visible and encourages care to be taken in making comparisons to ensure that definitions are not being cherry picked to derive a particular desired results result by others. Specifically moving on to ESG outcomes for the quarter, our health, safety, and environment performance remains outstanding. Our Triffa at Balama was zero point five in the December quarter, and the Balama Triffa has remained below one since late 2018. Our trick for Vidalia was again zero in the December quarter. We recorded a number of further positive COVID nineteen cases at the Lama late in the quarter after around two months with no new cases. All cases were minor or no symptoms and there's been no impact on operations. SARA has robust COVID nineteen protocols in place and these allow us to effectively manage at Vilama without interruption. SIRA has also made available and promoted vaccination and now ninety seven percent of employees and contractors are vaccinated at the Lama. The company is also supporting vaccination efforts in its host communities. We'll skip over the quarterly summary slide and go straight to the detail and I'll hand I'll hand over to Steve here to make some comments on the market and our corporate position. Steve Sean and good morning everyone. As Sean noted, twenty twenty one was a watershed year for EV production and sales, with a huge number of legacy automaker programmes and model announcements demonstrating mainstream integration. Slide six shows our primary leading indicator, global electric vehicle sales. Very positive momentum continued in EV sales and penetration in the fourth quarter. Global EV sales grew 115% in two thousand twenty one versus twenty twenty to approximately six point two million units with strong demand growth in China, Europe and the US. Global EV sales are more than eight hundred and fifty thousand units in December 2021 alone, a staggering outcome when compared to full year results of just over two million units only two years ago. Most analysts project further strong increases across all major geographies in two thousand twenty two and beyond, supported by growing consumer adoption and government policy. EV sales and battery demand growth are obviously causing strong momentum to flow through to demand for annotate material, as demonstrated by total Chinese active anode material production increasing to a record 71,000 tons in December 2021, and Q4 representing an almost 50% increase on the fourth quarter of the prior year. The trend on this front has been very strong over the past eighteen months and our interaction with spherical graphite processes in China demonstrates very robust demand. This demand growth has hit some supply headwinds, with both artificial graphite and natural graphite AAM supply in China being impacted by production challenges, which has reduced inventory. In the case of synthetic graphite active anomaterial, the impact of power disruptions, rising power prices, and an increased focus on emissions in Q core reduced availability and increased price on the synthetic products. And as highlighted on slide seven, the upstream natural raphite fines market has seen strong demand conditions coincide with supply disruption amongst Chinese domestic producers. Major Chinese production sources have been impacted by environmental restrictions, including tailings challenges, air and effluent emissions, as well as seeing the same power costs and disruption challenges that have impacted the synthetic graphite active anode material producers. These domestic Chinese market dynamics have coincided with the annual winter domestic production outage period, resulting in very low natural graphite inventories, exacerbated by import challenges caused by disruptions in the global shipping market and China logistics disruptions from COVID lockdowns. As a result, third party price reporting agencies are recording significant increase in Chinese domestic natural graphite science prices as demonstrated by the twenty twenty one spot price chart on slide seven. It is important to note that SIRA's weighted average price achieved may not reflect this spot price, as it includes prices for sales under a mix of spot and term contracts and different pricing mechanisms. We are, however, seeing contracted prices increasingly strong for new deals and spot shipments. Slides eight and nine provide the latest picture of the global and relevant regional battery manufacturing capacity pipeline forecasts and announcements, as well as the resultant graphite battery anodematerial forecast requirements. The growth ahead for the industry continues to strengthen, in particular for SIRA's Chinese natural graphite target customers and the USA active anomaterial market, providing a very strong backdrop for the company to increase production capacity utilisation of Volama and a great setting for Vadavia's potential initial expansion. Moving now to the corporate front, SIRA finished the quarter and the year with the cash balance of US$53 million compared to $74 million at the end of Q3. Given the confidence in progressing with Fidelia construction in the near term and to maintain the expected project schedule, we continue to invest in detail engineering activities and procurement of long lead items at Vadavia. SARA also completed the purchase of an adjacent parcel of land that will facilitate construction activities for Vadavia's initial expansion, as well as provide the required space to potentially expand the facility further as the market grows. The total amount of the daily investments through the quarter was six million dollars. With shipping constraints causing lower production and sales than anticipated at Palama. We were not able to achieve our minimum fifteen thousand tonnes per month production target and there were also several one off items through the quarter, including a thirteenth paycheck for local Mozin Beacon staff. We have also extended our procurement working capital cycle to ensure we are not impacted by any challenges for production inputs or shipping transit times have extended our receivables collection time frames. Funds continue to be received just later. Similarly, there is a lag between higher shipping costs being incurred at present and increased pricing on tons being shipped compared to what we're experiencing on new orders. However, this will balance out and there is strong upward pricing pressure through the order book, which will more than compensate for the shipping price increases we have seen. Over the short and medium term, we would see shipping costs stabilizing and beginning to moderate should the shipping market normalise, while current price support for natural graphite based on market factors is very strong. In the current market, we are also likely to achieve prepayment of natural graphite sales through brake box shipments, which will also improve working capital. Concurrent with the Vidalia FID processes, SARA continues to review funding requirements for the initial expansion and has engaged with government agencies relevant to critical minerals developments. As a result of these initiatives and of the dating and production off tape work, corporate costs were also higher than normal during the quarter. I'll now hand you back to Sean Thanks, Steve. And starting on slide ten through fourteen, we move to Balama production sales and logistics performance in Q4. Whilst disappointing that the global container shipping industry disruption continues to constrain production and sales, there are two critical takeaways beneath the headlines. Firstly, plant performance in the second half of twenty twenty one was better than in any prior period, benefiting from ongoing incremental improvement programmes. And secondly, we worked through a major option for alleviation of the shipping constraint from the first quarter of 2022. December 2021 quarter production was constrained by maximum inventory positions early in the quarter at Bellama and Nikala, and the continual promises of improvement in container in container shipping market disruption taking longer than expected to eventuate. This forced us to critically evaluate the alternatives and has led to the development of an additional grape bulk ship and option, which I'll speak to further in a moment. And that improvement is expected to materially improve production and sales from the March twenty twenty two quarter. At the Lama, thirteen thousand tonnes of natural graphite was produced at eighty two percent recovery and nineteen thousand tonnes sold during the December twenty twenty one quarter. All twenty thousand tonnes of finished product inventory at the conclusion of the quarter was contracted to customers, and in fact, much of that has since been cleared with a strong start to twenty twenty two. Product quality was consistent with previous quarters, with stable recovery in grade, and we we achieved a record eighty nine percent recovery in campaign operations during December. Our strong operational performance demonstrated during campaign production runs in the quarter saw us produce at an average daily production run rate of sixteen thousand tonnes per month pro radar and a maximum daily production rate of twenty four thousand tonnes per month pro radar. So we have strong confidence in increasing full llama production with continuous operations. Our C one cash costs of US one thousand one hundred and fifty nine dollars a tonne for the quarter is reflective of a fixed cost base and low production level for the quarter. The Lima C1 cash cost guidance is at US $430 to $470 a ton at a $15,000 tonne per month production run rate. The Lima unit costs are expected to reduce materially as the production rate increases beyond fifteen thousand tonnes per month. During the quarter, planned maintenance was also brought forward and optimization works completed with sustaining capital and TSF development spending of around $2.2 million for the quarter, giving us a strong open run at consistent production as inventory levels clear. On slide thirteen, uh we move to some further detail on the sales side. Starting Q4 with more than forty-five thousand tons of sales orders, Cyrus sold and shipped nineteen thousand tons of natural graphite constrained by the ongoing disruption in the container market, and primarily the inability to secure sufficient container capacity for Balama products on vessels sailing from Nikala to meet prevailing demand. Given the China market conditions that Steve mentioned previously, we are seeing exceptionally strong demand and forward contracting with end user customers and we're currently sitting with more than eighty thousand tonnes of sales orders for the March quarter and backlog to work through. The weighted average sales price increased to US five hundred and thirty dollars a tonne of ship in the December quarter and further price support is evident in coarse and fines markets post quarter end. New sales are being contracted at higher prices than achieved in the December twenty twenty one quarter. Fine sales accounted for approximately eighty percent of overall product sales during the quarter and the fines market is for the first time consistently exhibiting stronger price growth momentum than the coarse market. Chinese natural grappite supply disruption and the challenges in the shipping market severely affected Chinese inventory and restocking of natural graphite ahead of the seasonal winter production outages, and tight market conditions are expected to continue. Container shipping availability is expected to improve through this quarter, with additional capacity being added and lower seasonal competition expected from the agricultural sector out of Mozambique. Ongoing China port disruption from COVID lockdowns does remain a possible challenge. So while SIRA expects container shipping availability to improve, we've taken action to improve sales and alleviate the inventory constraint on production. And slide 14 outlines a major new logistics option that we've developed to commence brake bulk shipments through Pember fourth. Brake box shipments will provide an additional export route for SARA, enabling tree thing's flexibility in managing inventory between Balama, Nikala and Pemba. Secondly, significantly higher the lama product sales than could be achieved solely through Nikala port at in containers at present, and then thirdly, higher production rates at the Lama, facilitating more than 15,000 tonnes a month of production. Our first 10,000 tonne brake bulk shipment from Pember to China is scheduled in early February, and we have significant further customer demand for such shipments which have a shorter transit time, less likelihood of delay impacts of load and discharge, and an improved payment profile. PEMBA is approximately half the distance of Nikala from Balama by road, and SARA's integrated logistics service provider is providing transport, port and customs services for exports from PEMBA with additional warehousing contractors added. The combination of Nikala container shipments and Pemba Brake Bulk is expected to materially increase export sales and alleviate the inventory constraints previously impacting the llama production. Moving on to Vidalia on slides fifteen, sixteen and seventeen. We are well progressed in the processes to facilitate a final investment decision on the Vidalia initial expansion in the near term. We were very pleased in late Q four to announce the Offstake Agreement executed with Tesla to supply eight thousand tonnes of active anode material per annum from Vedalia at a fixed price for initial for an initial term of four years. This agreement underpins SARA's movement into the final phase of assessment for the initial Fidelio expansion and also contains an option for an additional volumes supporting evaluation of further expansion beyond the initial phase consistent with the market growth and announcements that we've talked about. Ongoing commercial and technical interactions demonstrate strong interest from other target customers in the remaining volumes and our future plans at Vidalia and are providing a strong motivation for SARA to assess a potential accelerated, larger expansion at Vidalia beyond the initial expansion projects. Detailed engineering of the Vidalia initial expansion project is fifty percent completed and has supported the technology, design, and operating assumptions in the Bank of World Feasibility Study from 2020. In addition, the detailed engineering and critical long lead equipment procurement completed to date is continuing to build readiness to proceed to construction subject to a final investment decision being made. With US seventy nine million dollars of capital invested to date in Vidalia's operations and project development and the continuing development of the Vidalia team, the de risking of SARA's entry into the downstream active anode material market continues towards the investment decision. As far as we are aware, we remain the furthest progress of any company in the development of an ex China vertically integrated source of natural graphite active anode material, leveraging the size, strength and operating history of the lama with an established facility and customer supported initial construction at the Dahlia. We're pleased to have reached this stage as supply chains are under increased scrutiny and pressure and we expect to communicate further around FID in the near term. To conclude on slide eighteen, SARA is very positive about the period ahead. EV sales growth, a constructive demand environment for anode material and Chinese supply disruption are driving strong demand and pricing for balama products. Increased shipping optionality, release of inventory constraints and strong demand should facilitate increasing alarm of production beyond fifteen thousand tonnes per month and enable higher sales volumes. And continuation of our FID and financing processes are seeing us working toward a potential FID for initial expansion with active anode material of behaviour in the near term. The current market and Tyre's progress demonstrate the unique position we occupy with the largest global integrated natural graphite operation at Palama. And the most advanced option for vertically integrated supply of natural graphite active NOS material outside Asia. We look forward to keeping you up to date with the company's progress. And with that we'll move across to questions. Thank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question today, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pound hash key. Please move, there might be a slight pause as questions queue. Once again, it is Star One and waiting aim to be announced. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sol Kavernek from Credit Swiss. Sol, please ask your question. Hi gents. Um just a couple of quick questions if I may, um particularly regarding just the scope for shipping improvements. I perhaps for just for some clarity here. Um I understand the brake bulk you're referring the the brake bulk option you're referring to, is that just that Pembroke report or is that also an option you're pursuing at McCullough? Are you possible to just give um some further colour on the potential scale of the volumes you could be uh getting out of tempo over the next six months. Yeah sure so uh apologies for my uh lack of voice uh at the end there. I was um just recovering from uh being unwell last week, so uh we'll see how we go on on questions. Um uh with regard to breakwall, um certainly the uh initial plans that we have in place um are out of uh out of PEMDA. Um there is the possibility of uh break bulk operations out of Nikala, but uh one of the issues at Nikala at the moment is ongoing um uh ongoing ingestion which is part of the issue for uh container shipments as well. So um the the initial uh plan is very much through Pemba. We've got good um uh plans and and set up in place and we'll see how the first shipments go and and we'll provide some further guidance around potential later volumes um as we move ahead. Thanks perhaps then if I could uh probe it this way. You talk about a ten thousand ton break up shipment for Pembot in February. Um d I mean to my mind that could indicate that, you know, we could get, you know, your fifteen K um um K T run rate almost entirely out of Pember if things progressed well there. Um would that be a a fair inference? Uh all things going well, Pember could PEBA capacity could Um as I said we'll we'll see how things progress, Paul, but certainly the combination of the two is is is pretty powerful. And you know, Nikala continues to be very important for us uh now and in the future. We have a number of customers who fake different sizes of shipments um and we need to be able to service both, but certainly putting Pemba and Nicala together um is is a pretty powerful combination at lifting volumes beyond fifteen thousand tonnes a month for sure. Thanks. And one last clarification. When you refer to kind of this spot volume out of Pember, um that's just referring to the port. It's still going to the same contracts. Is that correct, or is this also going to diff aerent market? Uh we all we are doing most of the um uh break bob shipping into the spot market um because they are uh under different logistics conditions, they are separate contracts um and and obviously um priced accordingly. Uh we might try my luck here, but can you give us any indication of what kind of spread we the difference in price you're getting or those spot volumes versus contract volumes? That you know, is weighting in at that five thirty. No, just to we've we've made uh some uh some commentary there about uh the December quarter uh weighted average price being at five thirty and obviously the the spot shipment being above that uh and strengthening significantly, so I'll leave it at that. Great, thank you very much. Our next telephone question is from the line of Mark Pichera from Foster Stockbroking. Mark, please ask your question. Yeah, hi Sean. Um yeah just a couple of questions. Um firstly on the FID for dailia, I was obviously earlier you previously said um you were looking at FID by the end of this month. Now you're starting in the near term. I was just wondering what the reasoning is there for for I guess the the the the slight delay and um and when you say near term, I gather is this in the current quarter and you know, would it be early or late this quarter? And then my second question is on the um the life cycle assessment you mentioned in the quarterly that a a third party critical review is yet to be undertaken. What are your thoughts there in terms of when you think you'll make this third party review and who would likely do that? Thanks. Thanks uh Mark. So uh with regard to the FID, um the technical commercial operational and funding elements of the FID review, um the processes around them are are well underway and progressing well. We recognise we communicated and and targeted January, but the processes are not completed yet. We will advise when when they are complete. They're expected to be be completed in the near term, and certainly you can read that as as within this quarter. There's no specific issues we're dealing with on that front. We're just working through the process to ensure we bring the best possible projects to execution. With regard to the um Mindairo um LCA assessment. The the potential for for third party uh independent review of um of the assessment um really then provides uh the potential for a for an additional amount of disclosure around specific comparison points. Um one of the things that you know we mentioned this previously on on prior calls is that this is this really is an emerging area. We've taken uh the most detailed and transparent approach that we uh could to um the full chain from Balama Gate to uh well Balama origin to to Cash Magate uh out of Vedalia. Um and we are waiting I think as well as doing the uh third party review um to see how others are continuing to uh describe these processes and making sure that the comparison points are fair and valid. So we'll work through that uh in conjunction with Mindairo, but we're really pleased with what we're seeing so far in terms of the general uh comparisons compared to China. Right. And and just a follow through on that, Sean, is this um I guess a key selling point in terms of some of your the potential off takers in terms of wanting to see see that L C A in terms of you know, making a decision, especially given the ESG somatics. Yeah, exactly. It's uh it's certainly you know all potential customers who are engaged with us around Baidalia ESV is is a key uh focus area for them as is supply diversification, as is quality and cost. So um this uh significant level of detail is something that that we are able to disclose uh to them under those processes. Um and certainly it's been very helpful uh on the way through so far in that differentiation. Okay, great. Thanks. And just a reminder, it is a star one to ask a telephone question. Our next telephone question is from Glenn Lawcop from Baron Joey. Please ask your question, Glenn. Oh Sean, good morning. Um, firstly I just wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the eighty thousand tons of sales orders. I mean, that's you know, over twenty five thousand a month for production. I mean, is that you've got to deliver that or you know, how does that work? I mean, is that just what you've got and that's for delivery over the next six months and nine months? Just trying to square the circle between that comment and your production rate at the moment. Thanks. Yeah, sure Glenn. The production rate uh has been constrained by by the inventory position, so obviously that's that's been key in developing uh the brake bulk option. Uh the um eighteen thousand tons of sales orders ahead of it so a mix of um previously contracted um uh term contracts and spot uh sales that have been made over prior months uh and and even more recently uh in uh anticipation of clearing some of the shipping issues and of course as I as I said earlier uh the new spot shipments done uh um spot break bulk shipments being done under new terms as well. So we are endeavoring to work through um the backlog as quickly as possible. Customers are all um uh essentially willing to take uh the material um even though it's been delayed uh because market conditions are incredibly tight, not just in China but uh but more broadly across um across the global market. So Sean is are you aiming to sell or ship eighty thousand tons and if you can get the logistics change to work? Is that is that the inference from that comment? Yeah certainly we're we're looking to get uh up above fifteen thousand tons as quickly as possible and to to be clearing through that um uh that backlog of sales orders for sure. Um we will have to continue uh uh booking new uh sales in in conjunction with uh clearing that backlog because um the the break bulk process um you know it gives us that opportunity to to mix the two uh to be able to clear um clear the backlog and and continue to um participate in in the current market. Okay, sorry, maybe I'm just a bit slow, but you mean even if you sell your your product inventory at twenty, that leaves you sixty which is twenty thousand a month. So is that sort of you know, if this sort of sales orders continue and you get another eighty thousand tons for the June quarter, you know, then you you've got to start pushing your business towards twenty a month in terms of well over twenty a month in production and hopefully logistics change stacks up. But it sounds like logistics is your bottleneck and that you your business needs to run at twenty plus thousand twenty five thousand a month if you can get the logistics chain to work. Is that what you're trying to tell us? Yeah. Other otherwise the backlog persists so, you know, clearly we're trying to um to work through that backlog and and have the logistics chain support us increasing production uh as quickly as possible to work through the backlog and continue to um uh satisfy new spot demand. So yes that's that's what we're saying. We're looking to um to try to lift that production rate as soon as um uh as soon as the logistics support is there. And and is that eighty thousand tonnes then if the logistics chain doesn't come through and you ship it in the June quarter, in the September quarter, are they priced on today or is it priced on delivery? Because obviously the price in six months time could be much higher and we just don't want to get we don't want to be thinking you're getting this big price lift on orders that were placed, you know, yesterday. Yeah, the weighted average price is is uh a mix of um pricing mechanisms, some of which were fixed at the time contracts were put in place, some of which are more related to timing of shipments. Um there will always be uh a lag uh and a difference between you know stock market price assessments and what our weighted average looks like across courts and and fines and as well as the timing of of prices being settled. But you know that is a clear strategy that we've had in place to ensure that we have a mix of mechanisms and a mix of um uh of different contract types uh so that we're not fully exposed to uh you know changes one way or the other in price uh all at the same time with every counterparty. Okay, that's clear. And and just the difference between the the brake bulk out of Pember and containers out in the cala. Yeah, I think both you know both shipping markets have been uh elevated, there's no doubt about that. This the single biggest issue for us has been the constraint of availability um uh over rates because you know stock market prices were increasing uh for for the product um faster than uh than freight rates and we just couldn't get enough m get enough uh capacity out of Nikala. So clearly the economics around um around brake bulk uh are different. You know, the cost cost structures are different. We have a shorter um shorter land logistics leg, um, you know, different contracting requirements around warehousing, stevedoring, etc., compared to container packing, but those economics have been taken into account and clearly at the moment it makes economic sense uh from a freight rate perspective and the overall logistics um costs uh to be undertaking these these types of shipments. Um and you know one very positive thing about this is if it um if it evolves successfully, you know, it opens up greater logistics opportunity for us in the future and it gives us exposure to slightly different cycles that occur through uh bulk shipping markets and container shipping markets. So could be very useful to us as as uh we continue in future. Can you put a quantum around one versus the other? Brake bulk shipping versus container? What's the dollar per tonne figure, please? Well what we said so far uh around uh the container freight rates on a on a per ton basis is that most of them have have more than doubled uh through this period of disruption. You know, clearly um some time ago we were talking about an average of around fifty dollars a tonne um on a container basis. Um it's significantly above uh a hundred dollars uh on average um across our destination suite um and the the component of uh uh break off freight um you know it's not it's not directly uh comparable because of the uh other logistics costs, but at the moment it's certainly competitive with those levels. Okay, so it's similar. And then just one final question. Just inventory obviously sounds like graphite inventory is is quite low, but do you have any visibility and sense on your customers' inventory of anodes and and even batteries in the chain, or do you think the whole chain is is quite quite low? Thanks. Wh production rates are at record levels in in China. You have uh constraints on import raw material supply. Um you have constraints on production capacity utilization. So um you know, in in the strange si situation where the Chinese uh anomaterial producers have actually produced at record levels, um, but to do so they've had to push really hard um to to to satisfy the demands um downstream and in doing so they've they've really put pressure on their raw materials inventory. So you know I think um there is potential challenge there in in terms of uh availability of anode material supply um as we head into twenty twenty two on a couple of those factors around um power costs, power disruption, availability of input material from the natural graphite side. Anecdotally of course we hear uh the the pressure um from the cell supply side that's being caused by both cathode materials and now starting to come through on the anode material side. Okay, thanks very much Sean. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to hand the conference back to Mr Schulder for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Well thanks to everyone for the attention uh today and as I said we look forward to keeping everybody uh up to date as we work through our uh final investment decision processes for Vidalia and uh keep everyone up to date with the very positive evolution of the upstream markets. But thanks very much for the attention. Thank you all for dialing in. You may all disconnect. Have a great day and goodbye.",

      "reference" : "Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Syria Resources Q4 Quarterly Update Conference Call. At this time, all participants are on listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask questions during the session, you need to press star-one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. For any assistance, it is star-zero. I'd now like to hand the conference over to our first speaker today, to Mr. Sean Bruno. Thank you, please go ahead. Thank you very much. Uh, good morning to everyone, and thank you for dialing in today. With me on the call is Steven Wells, our chief financial officer, and inaudible, our GM of business development and industrial relations. Today Sire released the December 2021 quarterly results covering operations, market conditions, the Medallion Project, and the outlook for natural graphite active and Earth materials, and its in-use markets. The fourth quarter in 2021, as a whole, was an extraordinarily important period for Sire. Repositioning is happening at a transformative point for the industry. Market conditions in the upstream market is the strongest they have been since the Lamens Commencement in 2017. Very strong momentum, inaudible, the existence of supply interruptions, and rising prices in natural graphite. The electric vehicle market has been showing remarkable growth through 2021, with sales doubling year on year, with more than six million units. Monthly global EV sales exceed 800,000 units for the first time in December. And global EV penetration reaching approximately eight percent. Growth is expected to be sustained, and this is driving significant EV and backstreet manufacturing expansion announcements, and capital programs in our downstream target markets. And the concurrent gap is evident, but in localized supply, we've input materials in the US and in Europe. Sire is signing during the quarter of a six volume inaudible off-site agreement with Tesla for inaudible material from the inaudible facility in the US marks the importance of Sire's integrated business, and potentially starting to fill a part of that gap. And all around the world governments and markets recognize the key role in critical minerals, such as graphite, in automotive electrifications and energy storage developments toward the objective of reducing carbon emissions. All of this as G differentiation also continues to rise in importance. As greater understanding sees challenges in parts of the existing factory materials in the supply chain. Each quarter, we reiterate our belief in the importance of the inaudible asset and the inaudible integrated inaudible material facility at inaudible. So the future of this transition, and as 2021 closed, we saw that this is becoming more apparent in customers, investments, and governments. Whilst it's disappointing, the disruption in the global container shipping industry constrains the line of production and sales in recent months, we have developed major logistics options to reduce the future impacts. And head into 2022 with strong optimism around the inaudible future and the potential for new term if inaudible approval at inaudible. So I forward reiterate our fundamental EXG commitment and performance focus, and every quarter that passes highlights the criticality of these efforts. Since the company's commencement, EXG excellence has been a key focus, and we're beginning to see the very real impacts of downstream customer funds and supply chain inaudible bring differentiation between incumbent production and our sales into sharp relief. During Q4, inaudible completed a detailed independent life cycle assessment of Sire's integrated operations from inaudible origin to inaudible material custom in importance with ISO standards. LCA is a globally recognized and scientifically validated methodology to quantify direct and embodied environmental impacts along the life cycle of reproducible process. And Environ is uh, an independent third party consultant with an established track record of life cycle systems in inaudible materials. The approach incorporates all material and energy inputs and direct emissions to air, land, and water associated with the production of our productive process, and identifies environmental hotspots in the production process by an assessment with an overall global warming potential outcome. Environ is LCA, estimated that Sire's operations exhibit materially lower global warming potential compared with representative natural graphite and synthetic graphite, and other materials and supplies benchmarked in China. The company's also advancing specific projects, including its solar and inaudible and inaudible options for inaudible to further reduce the environmental impact of its operations. It's worth noting here that a lot of partial change information is being communicated to the market around LCA. Sire is committed to making the full change from inaudible to final product's visible, and encourages care to be taken in making comparisons to ensure the definitions are not being cherry-picked to derives particular desired result, we result by evidence. Specifically moving on to ESV outcomes for the quarter health and safety environment performance remains outstanding. inaudible was 0.5 in the December quarter, and the inaudible has remained below one since late 2019. inaudible was, again, zero in the December quarter. We recorded a number of further casualties of COVID-19 cases at the inaudible late in the quarter after around two months with no new cases. All cases were minor or no symptoms, and there's been no impact on operations. Sire has robust COVID-19 protocols in place, and these allow us to effectively manage inaudible without interruption. Sire has also made available and promoted vaccinations, and now 97% of employees and contractors are vaccinated at inaudible. The company is also supporting vaccination efforts in its host communities. We'll skip ov… We'll skip over the quarterly summaries slide and go straight to the detail, and I'll hand over to Steve here to make some comments on the market and the corporate inaudible. Thank you Sean and good morning everyone. As Sean noted, 2021 was a watershed view for inaudible production and sales. A huge number of legacy inaudible programs and model announcements, demonstrating mainstream integration. Slide six shows our primary lending indicator. Global electric vehicle sales. Very positive momentum continued in EV sales and penetration in the fourth quarter. Global EV sales grew 115% in 2021 versus 2020, so approximately 6.2 million units with stronger inaudible than China, Europe, and the US. Globally, these sales are more than 850,000 units in December 2021 alone, a staggering outcome when compared to four-year results at just over two million units only two years ago. inaudible projects further strong increases across all geographies in 2022 and beyond, supported by growing consumer adoption and growing policy. EV sales and factory demand growth are obviously causing a strong momentum to flow through the demand for an Earth material. As demonstrated by total Chinese inaudible material production, increasing to a record 71,000 tons in December 2021. And Q4 representing an almost 50% increase on the fourth quarter on the prior year. The trend on this front has been very strong over the past 18 months, and our interaction with Spherical Graphite Processes in China demonstrated very robust demand. This demand growth inaudible with both artificial graphite and natural graphite at the supply in China. The impact of our production challenges, which has refused to inaudible. In the case of synthetic graphite inaudible material, the impact of power disruptions, rising power prices, and an increased focus on emissions in Q4, reduced availability and increased price all of synthetic products. And that's highlighted on slide seven, the upstream natural graphite funds market and the strong demand conditions coincide with supply disruption amongst China's domestic producers. Major Chinese production sources have been impacted by environmental restrictions including inaudible challenges, air and oil emissions, as well as saying the same power costing disruption challenges had an impact on the synthetic graphite inaudible material producers. These inaudible Chinese market dynamics have coincided with the annual winter domestic production average period, resulting in very low natural graphite inventories. Exacerbated by equal challenges caused by disruptions in the global shipping market, and China logistics disruptions from COVID lockdowns. As a result, third party price recording agencies are recording significant increase in Chinese domestic natural graphite inaudible prices, as demonstrated by the 2021 spot price chart from slide seven. It's important to note that Sire's inaudible may not reflect this spot price, and it includes process of sale under a mix of spot and term contracts and different pricing mechanisms. We are, however, seeing contracted prices increasingly strong for new deals and spot shipments. Slide eight and nine provide the latest picture of the global and relevant regional factory manufacturing capacity part one inaudible and announcements, as well as the resulting graphite factory inaudible material for… as well as the resultant graphite battery anode material forecast requirements. The growth ahead for the industry continues to strengthen, in particular for Syrah's Chinese natural graphite target customers, and the USA active nanomaterial market, providing a very strong backdrop for the company to increase production capacity utilization of Balama, and a great setting for Vidalia's potential initial expansion. Moving now to the corporate front. Uh, Syrah finished the quarter and the year with a cash balance of 53 million US dollars, compared to $74 million at the end of Q3. Given the confidence in progressing with Vidalia construction in the near term, and to maintain the expected project schedule, we continue to invest in detail engineering activities and procurement of long lead items at Vidalia. Syrah also completed the purchase of an adjacent parcel of land that will facilitate construction activities for Vidalia's initial expansion, as well as provide the required space to potentially the facility further as the market grows. The total amount of Vidalia investment through the quarter was $6 million. With shipping constraints causing lower production of sales than anticipated of Balama, we were not able to achieve our minimum 15,000 tons per month production target, and there were several one-off items through the quarter including a 13 paycheck for local inaudible. We have also extended our procurement work in capital cycle to ensure we are not impacted by any challenges to production inputs. While shipping transit times have extended our receivables collection timeframes. Funds continue to be received, just later. Similarly, there is a lag between higher shipping costs being incurred at present, and the increased pricing on tons being shipped compared to what we're experiencing on new orders. However, this will balance out, and there is strong upward pricing pressure through the order book which will more than compensate for the shipping price increases we will s- we have seen. Over the short to medium term, we would see shipping costs stabilizing and beginning to moderate, should the shipping marker normalize, while current price support for natural graphite based on market factors is very strong. In the current market we are also likely to achieve pre-payment of natural graphite sales through break bulk shipments, which will also improve working capital. In current with the Vidalia FID processes, Syrah continues to review funding requirements for the initial expansion, and is engages with government agencies relevant to critical minerals developments. As a result of these initiatives, and the Vidalia production inaudible work, corporate costs were also higher than normal during the quarter. I'll now hand you back to Shaun. Thanks, Steve. And, starting on slide 10 through to 14, we move to Balama production sales and logistics performance in Q4. Whilst it's disappointing that the global container shipping industry disruption continues to constrain production and sales, there are two critical takeaways beneath the headlines. Firstly, inaudible performance in the second half of 2021 was better than in any prior period, benefiting from ongoing incremental improvement programs. And secondly, we worked through a major option for alleviation of the shipping constraints from the first quarter of 2022. December 2021 quarter productions was constrained by maximum inventory positions early in the quarter at Balama and Nacala, and the continual promises on improvement in contain- in container shipping market disruption taking longer than expected to eventuate. This caused us to critically evaluate the alternatives, and has led to the development of an additional break bulk shipment option, which I'll speak to further in a moment. Uh, and that, uh, improvement is expected to materially improve production and sales from the March 2022 quarter. At Balama, 13,000 tons of natural graphite was produced at 82% recovery, and 19,000 tons sold during the December 2021 quarter. All 20,000 tons of finished product inventory at the conclusion of the quarter was contracted to customers, and in fact, much of that has since been cleared with a strong start to 2022. Product quality was consistent with previous quarters with stable recovery and grade, and we attrie- we achieved a record 89% recovery in campaign operations during December. Our strong operational performance demonstrated during campaign production runs in the quarter saw us produce at an average daily production run rate to 16,000 tons per month pro rata, and a maximum daily production rate of 24,000 tons per month probably rata, so we have strong confidence in increasing Balama production with continuous operations. Our C1 cash costs of US $1,159 a ton for the quarter is reflective of the fixed cost base and low production level for the quarter. Balama's C1 cash cost guidance is at US $430 -470 a ton at a 15,000 ton per month production run rate. Balama unit costs are expected to reduce materially as the production rate increases beyond 15,000 tons per month. During the quarter, planned maintenance was also brought forward and optimization works completed with sustaining capital CSF development spending of around $2.2 million for the quarter giving us a strong open run at consistent production as inventory levels clear. On slide 13, uh, we move to some further detail on the sales side. Starting Q4 with more than 45,000 tons of sales orders, Syrah sold and shipped 19,000 tons of natural graphite, constrained by the ongoing disruption in the container market. And primarily the inability to secure sufficient container capacity for Balama products on vessels sailing from Nacala to meet prevailing demand. Given the China market conditions that Steve mentioned perviously, we are seeing exceptionally strong demands and forward contracting with end-user customers, and we're currently sitting with more than 80,000 tons of sales orders for the March quarter in backlog to work through. The weighted average sales price increased to US $530 a ton inaudible from the December quarter, and further price support is evident in coarse and fines markets post-quarter end. New sales are being contracted at higher prices than achieved in the December 2021 quarter. Fines sales accounted for approximately 80% of overall product sales during the quarter, and the fines market is, for the first time, consistently exhibiting stronger price growth momentum than the coarse market. Chinese natural graphite supply disruption, and the challenges in the shipping market severely affected Chinese inventory and restocking on natural graphite ahead of the seasonal winter production outages. And tight market conditions are expected to continue. Container shipping availability is expected to improve through this quarter with additional capacity being added and lower seasonal competition expected from the agricultural sector out of Mozambique. Ongoing China port disruption from Covid lockdowns does remain a possible challenge. So, while Syrah expect, uh, container shipping availability to improve, we've taken action to improve sales and alleviate the inventory constraint on production, and slide 14 outlines a major new logi- logistics option that we've developed to commence break bulk shipments through in the port. Uh, break bulk shipments will provide an additional export route for Syrah enabling three things, flexibility in managing inventory between Balama, Nacala, and Pemba. Secondly, significantly higher Balama product sales in inaudible solely through Nacala port at, in containers at the present. And then thirdly, higher production rates at Balama facilitating more than 15,000 tons a month of production. Our first 10,000 ton break bulk shipment fro Pemba to China is scheduled in early February, uh, and we have significant further customer demand for such shipments which have a shorter transit time, less likelihood of delay impacts of load and discharge, and, and improved payment profile. Pemba is approximately half the distance of Nacala from Balama by road, and Syrah's integrated logistics service provider is providing transpor- -port, and customer services for exports from Pemba, with additional warehousing contractors added. The combination of Nacala container shipments and Pemba break bulk is expected to materially increase export sales. Uh, and alleviate the inventory constraints previously impacting Balama production. Moving onto Vidalia on slides 15, 16, and 17, we are well progressed in the processes to facilitate a final investment decision on the Vidala initial expansion in the near term. We were very pleased in late Q4 to announce the offtake agreement executed with Tesla to supply 8,000 tons of active anode material per annum from Vidalia at the fixed for initial, for an initial term of four years. This agreement underpins Syrah's movement into the final phase of assessment for the initial Vidalia expansion, and also contains an option for and additial, additional volume supporting evaluation for the further expansion beyond the initial phase, consistent with the market growth and announcements that we've talked about. Ongoing commercial and technical interactions demonstrate strong interest from other target customers in the remaining volumes, and our future plans at Vidala, and are providing strong motivation for Syrah to assess a potential accelerated, larger expansion at Vidalia beyond the initial expansion project. Detailed engineering of the Vidalia i- initial expansion project-… detailed engineering of the Vidalia initial expansion project is 50% completed and has supported the technology, design, and operating assumptions in the bankable feasibility study from 2020. In addition, the detailed engineering and critical long lead, uh, equipment procurement completed to date is continuing to build readiness to proceed to construction subject to a final investment decision being made. With you at $79 million of capital invested to date in Vidalia's operations and project development, and the continuing development of the Vidalia team, the de-risking of <unk> entry into the downstream active anode material market continues toward the investment decision. As far as we are aware, we remain the furthest progressed of any company in the development of an ex-China vertically integrated source of natural graphite active anode material, leveraging the size, strength and operating history of Balama within established facility and customer supported initial construction at Vidalia. We're pleased to have reached this stage as supply chains are under increased scrutiny and pressure, and we expect to communicate further around FID in the new term. To conclude, on slide 18, Syrah is very positive about the period ahead via the sales growth, the constructive demand environment for anode material and Chinese supply disruption are driving strong demand and pricing for Balama products, increased shipping optionality, uh, release of inventory constraints and strong demand should facilitate increasing Balama production beyond 15,000 tons per month and enable higher sales volumes. And continuation of our FID and finances processes are seen as sweeping toward a potential FID for initial expansion in effective anode material and Vidalia in the new term. Excuse me. The current market and Syrah's progress demonstrate the unique position we occupy with the largest global integrated natural graphite operation at Balama and the most advanced option for vertically integrated supply with natural graphite active anode material outside Asia. We look forward to keeping you up to date with the company's progress. And with that, we'll move across to questions. Thank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question today, please press star one on your telephone, and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pound inaudible key. Please note there might be a slight pause at ask question queue. Once again, it is star one and wait for your name to be announced. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sole Cavernack from Creditors. Sole please ask your question. Hi, gents. Um, just a couple quick questions if I may particularly regarding just the scope for shipping improvements. I, perhaps for just for some clarity here, um, I understand, the break bulk you're refer- the, the break bulk option you're referring to, is that just the Pemba report? Or is that also an option your pursuing out in Nacala? Are you possible to just give, um, some further color on the potential scale of the volume you could be, uh, getting out of Pemba in the next six months? Sure, Sole. Uh, apologies for my, uh, lack of voice at the end there. I was, um, just recovering from, uh, being unwell last week. So, uh, we'll see how we go on, on question. Um, uh, with regard break bulk, um, certainly the, uh, initial plans that we have in place, um, are out of, uh, out of Pemba. Um, there is the possibility of, uh, break bulk operations out of Nacala. But, uh, one of the issues at Nacala at the moment is ongoing, um, uh, ongoing investment, which is part of the issue for, uh, container shipments as well. So, um, the, the initial, uh, plan is very much through Pemba. We've got good, um, uh, plans and, and setup in place, and we'll see how the first shipments go, and, and we'll provide some further guidance around potential later volumes, um, as we move ahead. Thanks, uh, perhaps then if I could, uh, probe in this way, you talk about a 10,000 ton break bulk Pemba shipment for in February. Um, the, uh, w- I mean, to my mind, that could indicate that, you know, we could get, you know, your 15 k- kil- um, um, KT and run rate almost entirely out of Pemba if things progressed well there. Um, would that be a, a fair inference, all things going well Pemba could have a capacity could meet or even exceed Nacala? Um, as I said, we'll, we'll see how things progress more, but certainly the combination of the two is, is, is pretty powerful. Um, and, you know, Nacala continues to be very important for us, uh, now and in the future. We had a number of customers who take different sizes of shipments, um, and we need to be able to service both. But certainly putting Pemba and Nacala together, um, is, is a pretty powerful combination at lifting volumes beyond 15,000 tons a month for sure. Uh, thanks, and w- one last clarification. When you refer to kind of this spot volume out of Pemba, um, that's just referring to the port that's still going into the same contracts. Is that correct, or is this also going to a different market? Uh, we all, we are doing most of the, um, uh, break bulk shipment into the spot market, um, because they are, uh, different logistics conditions. They are separate contracts, um, and, and obviously, um, priced accordingly. Understood, and, uh, <laugh> I might try my luck here, but do you have any indication of what kind of spread we, the difference in price you're getting on those spot volumes versus contract volumes that, you know, is waiting in at that inaudible? No, I just, so we've, we've made, uh, some, uh, some commentary there about, uh, the December quarter, um, valued average price being at 5, 30 and obviously, the, the spot shipment thing, the process, uh, and the strengthening significantly, so I'll leave it at that. Great, thank you very much. Our next telephone question is from the line of Mark Fichera from Foster Stock Broking. Mark, please ask your question. Yeah, hi Sean. Um, so yeah, just a couple of questions. Um, firstly on the FID so Vidalia, I was, obviously, earlier, you previously said, um, you're looking at FID by the end of this month, and then, you're starting in the new term. I was just wondering what the reasoning is there for, for I guess, the, the, the, the slight delay, and, um, and when you say new term, I gather, i- is this in the current quarter, and that would be early or late this quarter? And then, my second question is on the, um, the lifecycle assessment you mentioned in the quarterly that, uh, a third party critical view has yet to be undertaken. What are your thoughts there in terms of when you think you'll make this third party review, and who would likely do that? Thanks. Thanks, uh, Mark. So, uh, with regard to the FID, um, the technical, commercial operation we're planning on the FID review, um, the processes around them, uh, are well underway and progressing well. We recognize we communicated in, and targeted January, but the process is not completed yet. Uh, we will advise when, when they are complete. Um, they're expected to be, be completed in the near term, and, and certainly you can read that, as, as within this quarter. Um, you know, loads of specific issues we're dealing with on that front. We're just working through the process to ensure we bring the best possible projects, uh, to execution. Um, with regard to the, um, the enviro, um, LCA assessment, um, the, the potential for, for third party, uh, independent review of, um, of the assessment, um, really then provides, uh, the potential for, for an additional amount of disclosure around specific comparison points. Um, one of the things that, you know, I've mentioned this previously on, on prior calls is that, this is, this really is an emerging area. We've taken, uh, the most detailed and transparent approach that we, uh, could to, um, the full chain from the Balama inaudible to, uh, well, Balama origin to, to customer gate, uh, out of Vidalia. Um, and we are waiting, I think as well as doing it, a third party review, um, to see how others are continuing to, uh, describe these processes and making sure that the comparison points are fair and balanced. So we'll work through that in conjunction with enviro, but we're really pleased with what we've seen so far in terms of the general, uh, comparisons compared to China. Right, and, and just to follow through on that, Sean, is this, um, I guess a key selling point in terms of some of your, the potential off takers in terms of wanting to see, see that LCA in terms of, you know, making a decision especially given the ESG somatics. Yeah, exactly. It's, uh, it's certainly, you know, all potential customers who are engaged with us around Vidalia, uh, ESG's, is a key, uh, focus area for them as is supply diversification as is quality and cost. So, um, this, uh, significant level of detail is something that, that we are able to disclose, uh, to them under those processes. Um, and certainly it's been very helpful, uh, on the way through so far in that differentiation. Okay, great. Thanks. And just a reminder. It is star one to ask a telephone question. Our next telephone question is from N- Press * 1 to ask a telephone question. Our next telephone question is from Glyn Lawcock from Barrenjoey. Please ask your question Glyn. Um sure. Good morning, um firstly I just wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the 80,000 tons of sales orders. I mean, that's you know, over 25,000 a month for production. I mean, is that, you've got to deliver that, or you know, how does that work? I mean is that just what you've got and that's for delivery over the next six months and nine months? Just trying to square the circle between that comment and your production rate at the moment. Thanks Yeah sure Glyn, the production rate uh has been constrained by, by the inventory position so obviously that's, that's been key in developing uh the break lock option. Uh, the um 80,000 tons of sales orders ahead of us are a mix of um, previously contracted um term contracts and stock sales that have been made over prior months um and, and even more recently uh in uh anticipation of clearing some of the shipping issues, and of course as I, as I said earlier, uh the new stock shipments and um stock break options being done under new terms as well. So we are endeavoring to work through um the backlog as quickly as possible, customers uh all, um essentially willing to take uh the material uh even though it's been delayed uh, because market conditions are incredible tight, not just in China uh but more broadly across um, across the global market. So Sean, is, are you aiming to sell or ship 80,000 tons and if you can get the logistics changed to work? Is that, is that the inference from that comment? Yes, certainly we're, we're looking to get uh up above 15, 000 tons as quickly as possible and to, to be clearing through that um, that backlog of sales orders for sure. Um we will have to continue uh, booking new sales in, in conjunction with uh clearing that backlog because, um, the break lock process, you know, gives us that opportunity to mix the two, uh to be able to clear um, clear the backlog and, and continue to um, to stay in the current market. Okay, sorry maybe I'm just a bit slow but, I mean even if you sell your, your product inventory at 20, that leaves you with 60, which is 20,000 a month, so, is that sort of, you know, if this sort of sales orders continue and you get another 80,000 tons for the June quarter, you know. Then you, you've got to start pushing your business towards 20 a month in terms of, or over 20 a month in production, and hope the logistics change stacks up but it sounds like logistics is your bottleneck and that you, your business needs to run at 20 plus, 25,000 a month if you can get the logistics chain to work. Is that what you're trying to tell us? Yeah, otherwise, otherwise the backlog persists. So, you know, clearly we are trying to um to work through that backlog and, and have the logistics chain support us, increasing production as quickly as possible to work through the backlog and continue to um satisfy new stocks and runs. So yes, that's, that's what we're saying. We are looking to um to try to lift that production rate as soon as um as soon as the logistics is sorted there. And, and is that 80,000 tons, what if the logistics chain doesn't come through and you ship it in the June quarter, in the September quarter, are they priced on today, or is it priced on delivery? 'Cause obviously the price in six months time could be much higher and we just don't want to get, we don't want to be thinking you're getting this big price lift on orders that were placed, you know, yesterday. Yeah the weighted average price is um a mix of um pricing mechanisms, some of which were fixed at the time contracts were put in place, some of which are more related to the timing of shipments. Um there will always be a, a lag uh, and the difference between you know, stock market price assessments and what our weighted average looks like because, of course in fines and as well as the timing of prices being settled. But you know that is um, a clear strategy that we've had in place, um to ensure that we have a mix of mechanisms and a mix of um different contract types so that were not fully exposed to uh you know, changes one way or the other, in price, all at the same time as every counter party. Okay, that's clear. And, and just the difference between the break bulk out of inaudible and containers out on the inaudible, it, you're selling everything on a today if basis. Is, can you talk to me about the freight differential, shipping bulk, bulk, break bulk versus container, and you know, how that markets looking at the moment with the two freight rates? Yeah, I think, yeah both shipping markets have been uh elevated, there's no doubt about that. The single biggest issue for us has been the constraints of availability um over rates because, you know, stock market prices were increasing um for the products um, faster than freight rates, so we just couldn't get enough, get enough uh, capacity out of inaudible. So clearly the economics around, uh around Bangkok are different, you know. Cost structures are different, we have assured uh assured our land logistics leg, um you now different contracting requirements around their housing, stevedoring, etc compared to container packing but, those economics have been taken into account and clearly at the moment, it makes economic sense, from the freight rate perspective, and the overall logistics costs, to be undertaking these types of shipments. And you know one very positive thing about this is if it, um if it develops successfully, you know, it opens up greater logistics opportunity for us in the future and it gives us exposure to slightly different cycles that occur through um bulk shipping markets and container shipping markets. So it could be very useful to us as, uh we continue in future. Can you put a quantum around one versus the other, break bulk shipping versus container? What's the dollar per current figure? Please. Well as i have said so far around the container freight rates on a per ton basis is that most of them have more than doubled through this period of disruption you know. Clearly um some time ago we were talking about an average of around $50 a ton um on a container basis. It's significantly above $100 on average across our destination sweep. Um and the, the component of uh break lock rates, um you know it's, it's not directly comparable because of the other logistics costs. But at the moment its certainly competitive with those levels. Okay so it similar. And then just one final question. Just inventory, it obviously sounds like graphite freight inventory is quite low but, do you have any visibility and sense on your customer's inventory of anodes, and evens batteries, in the chain, or do you think the whole chain is quite, quite low? Thanks. I wouldn't comment too much on the battery side, but certainly on the anode side, um, you've got a situation where um, production rates are at record levels in China. You have constraints on import raw material supply, um you have constraints on production and capacity utilization, so, um you're in the strange situation where the Chinese anode material producers have actually produced at record levels. Um, but to do so they've had to push really hard um to, to satisfy demand downstream and in doing so they, they have really put pressure on their raw materials inventory. So you know I think there is potential challenge there in, in terms of availability of anode material supplies um as we head into 2022 on a couple of those factors around power, loss of power disruption, availability of input material from the natural graphite site. Um you know and then sadly of course we hear the pressure from the sales supply side that's been caused by both cathode materials, and now starting to come through on the anode materials side. Okay, thanks very much Sean. Thanks Glyn. If there are no further questions at this time I would now like to hand the conference back to Mr Sean Crowder for the closing remarks. Please go ahead. Well thanks to everyone for the attention today, and as I said we look forward to keeping everybody up to date, um and as we work through our final investment student processes for the day now, and keep everyone up to date with the very positive evolution of the upstream market. But thanks very much for the attention. Thank you all for dialing in. You may all disconnect. Have a great day and goodbye.",
      "withCtc" : "Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Syria Resources Q four quarterly update conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question and. answer session To ask a question during the session, you need to press star one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. For any assistance it is star zero. I'd now like to hand the conference over to you for a speaker today, to Mr. Sean Burnock. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. Uh good morning to everyone and thank you for dialing in today. With me on the call is Stephen Wells, our Chief Financial Officer and Virin Virer, our GM of Business Development and Investor Relations. Today, SARA released its December twenty twenty one quarterly results covering operations, market conditions, the Vidalia project, and the outlook for natural graphite, active anode material and its end use market. The fourth quarter and twenty twenty one as a whole was an extraordinarily important period for SIRA, repositioning the company at a transformative point for the industry. Market conditions in the upstream market are the strongest they have been since the Lama's commencement in twenty seventeen, with very strong momentum in demand growth, the existence of supply interruptions, and rising prices for natural graphite. The electric vehicle market has shown remarkable growth through twenty twenty one, with sales doubling year on year to more than six million units, monthly global EV sales exceeding eight hundred thousand units for the first For the first time in December, and global EV penetration reaching approximately 8%. Growth is expected to be sustained, and this is driving significant EV and battery manufacturing expansion announcements and capital programmes in our downstream target markets, and the concurrent gap is evident but in localised supply of input materials in the US and in Europe. SIRES signing during the quarter of a fixed volume and price off take agreement with Tesla for aquivanode material from the Vidal facility in the US marked the importance of SARE's integrated business in potentially starting to fill a part of that gap. And all around the world, governments and markets recognise the key role of critical minerals such as graphite in automotive electrification and energy storage development towards the objective of reducing carbon emissions. Positive ESG differentiation also continues to rise in importance as greater understanding sees challenges in parts of the existing battery materials supply chain. Each quarter we reiterate our belief in the importance of the Balama asset and our vertically integrated active anode material facility at Bedalia to the future of this transition. And as twenty twenty one closed we saw that this is becoming more apparent to customers, investors and governments. Whilst it's disappointing that disruption in the global container shipping industry constrained alarm production and sales in recent months. We have developed a major logistics option to reduce the future impacts and head into twenty twenty two with strong optimism around the Lama's future and the potential for near term FID approval at Bardalia. Slide four reiterates our fundamental ESG commitments and performance focus, and every quarter that passes highlights the criticality of this effort. Since the company's commencement, ESG Excellence has been a key focus and we're beginning to see the very real impact of downstream customer requirements and supply chain auditing bring differentiation between incumbent production and ourselves into sharp relief. During Q four, Minbarro completed a detailed independent life cycle assessment of SARA's integrated operations from Balama origin to Vidalia Active Anode Material Customer Gate in accordance with ISO standards. LCA is a globally recognised and scientifically validated methodology to quantify direct and embodied environmental impacts along the life cycle of a product or process and enVairo is uh an independent third party consultant with an established track record of life cycle assessments in the battery materials space. The approach incorporates all material and energy inputs and direct emissions to air, land and water associated with the production of a product or process and identifies environmental hotspots in the production process via an assessment of an overall global warming potential outcome. Minbaro's LCA estimated that SARA's operations exhibit materially lower global warming potential compared with representative natural graphite and synthetic graphite anode material suppliers benchmarked in China. The company is also advancing specific projects, including the solar and battery system at Vilama, and longer-term power options for Vidalia to further reduce the environmental impacts of its operations. It's worth noting here that a lot of partial chain information is being communicated to the market around LCA. SIRA is committed to making the full chain from mine to final product visible and encourages care to be taken in making comparisons to ensure that definitions are not being cherry picked to derive a particular desired results result by others. Specifically moving on to ESG outcomes for the quarter, our health, safety, and environment performance remains outstanding. Our Triffa at Balama was zero point five in the December quarter, and the Balama Triffa has remained below one since late 2018. Our trick for Vidalia was again zero in the December quarter. We recorded a number of further positive COVID nineteen cases at the Lama late in the quarter after around two months with no new cases. All cases were minor or no symptoms and there's been no impact on operations. SARA has robust COVID nineteen protocols in place and these allow us to effectively manage at Vilama without interruption. SIRA has also made available and promoted vaccination and now ninety seven percent of employees and contractors are vaccinated at the Lama. The company is also supporting vaccination efforts in its host communities. We'll skip over the quarterly summary slide and go straight to the detail and I'll hand I'll hand over to Steve here to make some comments on the market and our corporate position. Steve Sean and good morning everyone. As Sean noted, twenty twenty one was a watershed year for EV production and sales, with a huge number of legacy automaker programmes and model announcements demonstrating mainstream integration. Slide six shows our primary leading indicator, global electric vehicle sales. Very positive momentum continued in EV sales and penetration in the fourth quarter. Global EV sales grew 115% in two thousand twenty one versus twenty twenty to approximately six point two million units with strong demand growth in China, Europe and the US. Global EV sales are more than eight hundred and fifty thousand units in December 2021 alone, a staggering outcome when compared to full year results of just over two million units only two years ago. Most analysts project further strong increases across all major geographies in two thousand twenty two and beyond, supported by growing consumer adoption and government policy. EV sales and battery demand growth are obviously causing strong momentum to flow through to demand for annotate material, as demonstrated by total Chinese active anode material production increasing to a record 71,000 tons in December 2021, and Q4 representing an almost 50% increase on the fourth quarter of the prior year. The trend on this front has been very strong over the past eighteen months and our interaction with spherical graphite processes in China demonstrates very robust demand. This demand growth has hit some supply headwinds, with both artificial graphite and natural graphite AAM supply in China being impacted by production challenges, which has reduced inventory. In the case of synthetic graphite active anomaterial, the impact of power disruptions, rising power prices, and an increased focus on emissions in Q core reduced availability and increased price on the synthetic products. And as highlighted on slide seven, the upstream natural raphite fines market has seen strong demand conditions coincide with supply disruption amongst Chinese domestic producers. Major Chinese production sources have been impacted by environmental restrictions, including tailings challenges, air and effluent emissions, as well as seeing the same power costs and disruption challenges that have impacted the synthetic graphite active anode material producers. These domestic Chinese market dynamics have coincided with the annual winter domestic production outage period, resulting in very low natural graphite inventories, exacerbated by import challenges caused by disruptions in the global shipping market and China logistics disruptions from COVID lockdowns. As a result, third party price reporting agencies are recording significant increase in Chinese domestic natural graphite science prices as demonstrated by the twenty twenty one spot price chart on slide seven. It is important to note that SIRA's weighted average price achieved may not reflect this spot price, as it includes prices for sales under a mix of spot and term contracts and different pricing mechanisms. We are, however, seeing contracted prices increasingly strong for new deals and spot shipments. Slides eight and nine provide the latest picture of the global and relevant regional battery manufacturing capacity pipeline forecasts and announcements, as well as the resultant graphite battery anodematerial forecast requirements. The growth ahead for the industry continues to strengthen, in particular for SIRA's Chinese natural graphite target customers and the USA active anomaterial market, providing a very strong backdrop for the company to increase production capacity utilisation of Volama and a great setting for Vadavia's potential initial expansion. Moving now to the corporate front, SIRA finished the quarter and the year with the cash balance of US$53 million compared to $74 million at the end of Q3. Given the confidence in progressing with Fidelia construction in the near term and to maintain the expected project schedule, we continue to invest in detail engineering activities and procurement of long lead items at Vadavia. SARA also completed the purchase of an adjacent parcel of land that will facilitate construction activities for Vadavia's initial expansion, as well as provide the required space to potentially expand the facility further as the market grows. The total amount of the daily investments through the quarter was six million dollars. With shipping constraints causing lower production and sales than anticipated at Palama. We were not able to achieve our minimum fifteen thousand tonnes per month production target and there were also several one off items through the quarter, including a thirteenth paycheck for local Mozin Beacon staff. We have also extended our procurement working capital cycle to ensure we are not impacted by any challenges for production inputs or shipping transit times have extended our receivables collection time frames. Funds continue to be received just later. Similarly, there is a lag between higher shipping costs being incurred at present and increased pricing on tons being shipped compared to what we're experiencing on new orders. However, this will balance out and there is strong upward pricing pressure through the order book, which will more than compensate for the shipping price increases we have seen. Over the short and medium term, we would see shipping costs stabilizing and beginning to moderate should the shipping market normalise, while current price support for natural graphite based on market factors is very strong. In the current market, we are also likely to achieve prepayment of natural graphite sales through brake box shipments, which will also improve working capital. Concurrent with the Vidalia FID processes, SARA continues to review funding requirements for the initial expansion and has engaged with government agencies relevant to critical minerals developments. As a result of these initiatives and of the dating and production off tape work, corporate costs were also higher than normal during the quarter. I'll now hand you back to Sean Thanks, Steve. And starting on slide ten through fourteen, we move to Balama production sales and logistics performance in Q4. Whilst disappointing that the global container shipping industry disruption continues to constrain production and sales, there are two critical takeaways beneath the headlines. Firstly, plant performance in the second half of twenty twenty one was better than in any prior period, benefiting from ongoing incremental improvement programmes. And secondly, we worked through a major option for alleviation of the shipping constraint from the first quarter of 2022. December 2021 quarter production was constrained by maximum inventory positions early in the quarter at Bellama and Nikala, and the continual promises of improvement in container in container shipping market disruption taking longer than expected to eventuate. This forced us to critically evaluate the alternatives and has led to the development of an additional grape bulk ship and option, which I'll speak to further in a moment. And that improvement is expected to materially improve production and sales from the March twenty twenty two quarter. At the Lama, thirteen thousand tonnes of natural graphite was produced at eighty two percent recovery and nineteen thousand tonnes sold during the December twenty twenty one quarter. All twenty thousand tonnes of finished product inventory at the conclusion of the quarter was contracted to customers, and in fact, much of that has since been cleared with a strong start to twenty twenty two. Product quality was consistent with previous quarters, with stable recovery in grade, and we we achieved a record eighty nine percent recovery in campaign operations during December. Our strong operational performance demonstrated during campaign production runs in the quarter saw us produce at an average daily production run rate of sixteen thousand tonnes per month pro radar and a maximum daily production rate of twenty four thousand tonnes per month pro radar. So we have strong confidence in increasing full llama production with continuous operations. Our C one cash costs of US one thousand one hundred and fifty nine dollars a tonne for the quarter is reflective of a fixed cost base and low production level for the quarter. The Lima C1 cash cost guidance is at US $430 to $470 a ton at a $15,000 tonne per month production run rate. The Lima unit costs are expected to reduce materially as the production rate increases beyond fifteen thousand tonnes per month. During the quarter, planned maintenance was also brought forward and optimization works completed with sustaining capital and TSF development spending of around $2.2 million for the quarter, giving us a strong open run at consistent production as inventory levels clear. On slide thirteen, uh we move to some further detail on the sales side. Starting Q4 with more than forty-five thousand tons of sales orders, Cyrus sold and shipped nineteen thousand tons of natural graphite constrained by the ongoing disruption in the container market, and primarily the inability to secure sufficient container capacity for Balama products on vessels sailing from Nikala to meet prevailing demand. Given the China market conditions that Steve mentioned previously, we are seeing exceptionally strong demand and forward contracting with end user customers and we're currently sitting with more than eighty thousand tonnes of sales orders for the March quarter and backlog to work through. The weighted average sales price increased to US five hundred and thirty dollars a tonne of ship in the December quarter and further price support is evident in coarse and fines markets post quarter end. New sales are being contracted at higher prices than achieved in the December twenty twenty one quarter. Fine sales accounted for approximately eighty percent of overall product sales during the quarter and the fines market is for the first time consistently exhibiting stronger price growth momentum than the coarse market. Chinese natural grappite supply disruption and the challenges in the shipping market severely affected Chinese inventory and restocking of natural graphite ahead of the seasonal winter production outages, and tight market conditions are expected to continue. Container shipping availability is expected to improve through this quarter, with additional capacity being added and lower seasonal competition expected from the agricultural sector out of Mozambique. Ongoing China port disruption from COVID lockdowns does remain a possible challenge. So while SIRA expects container shipping availability to improve, we've taken action to improve sales and alleviate the inventory constraint on production. And slide 14 outlines a major new logistics option that we've developed to commence brake bulk shipments through Pember fourth. Brake box shipments will provide an additional export route for SARA, enabling tree thing's flexibility in managing inventory between Balama, Nikala and Pemba. Secondly, significantly higher the lama product sales than could be achieved solely through Nikala port at in containers at present, and then thirdly, higher production rates at the Lama, facilitating more than 15,000 tonnes a month of production. Our first 10,000 tonne brake bulk shipment from Pember to China is scheduled in early February, and we have significant further customer demand for such shipments which have a shorter transit time, less likelihood of delay impacts of load and discharge, and an improved payment profile. PEMBA is approximately half the distance of Nikala from Balama by road, and SARA's integrated logistics service provider is providing transport, port and customs services for exports from PEMBA with additional warehousing contractors added. The combination of Nikala container shipments and Pemba Brake Bulk is expected to materially increase export sales and alleviate the inventory constraints previously impacting the llama production. Moving on to Vidalia on slides fifteen, sixteen and seventeen. We are well progressed in the processes to facilitate a final investment decision on the Vidalia initial expansion in the near term. We were very pleased in late Q four to announce the Offstake Agreement executed with Tesla to supply eight thousand tonnes of active anode material per annum from Vedalia at a fixed price for initial for an initial term of four years. This agreement underpins SARA's movement into the final phase of assessment for the initial Fidelio expansion and also contains an option for an additional volumes supporting evaluation of further expansion beyond the initial phase consistent with the market growth and announcements that we've talked about. Ongoing commercial and technical interactions demonstrate strong interest from other target customers in the remaining volumes and our future plans at Vidalia and are providing a strong motivation for SARA to assess a potential accelerated, larger expansion at Vidalia beyond the initial expansion projects. Detailed engineering of the Vidalia initial expansion project is fifty percent completed and has supported the technology, design, and operating assumptions in the Bank of World Feasibility Study from 2020. In addition, the detailed engineering and critical long lead equipment procurement completed to date is continuing to build readiness to proceed to construction subject to a final investment decision being made. With US seventy nine million dollars of capital invested to date in Vidalia's operations and project development and the continuing development of the Vidalia team, the de risking of SARA's entry into the downstream active anode material market continues towards the investment decision. As far as we are aware, we remain the furthest progress of any company in the development of an ex China vertically integrated source of natural graphite active anode material, leveraging the size, strength and operating history of the lama with an established facility and customer supported initial construction at the Dahlia. We're pleased to have reached this stage as supply chains are under increased scrutiny and pressure and we expect to communicate further around FID in the near term. To conclude on slide eighteen, SARA is very positive about the period ahead. EV sales growth, a constructive demand environment for anode material and Chinese supply disruption are driving strong demand and pricing for balama products. Increased shipping optionality, release of inventory constraints and strong demand should facilitate increasing alarm of production beyond fifteen thousand tonnes per month and enable higher sales volumes. And continuation of our FID and financing processes are seeing us working toward a potential FID for initial expansion with active anode material of behaviour in the near term. The current market and Tyre's progress demonstrate the unique position we occupy with the largest global integrated natural graphite operation at Palama. And the most advanced option for vertically integrated supply of natural graphite active NOS material outside Asia. We look forward to keeping you up to date with the company's progress. And with that we'll move across to questions. Thank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question today, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pound hash key. Please move, there might be a slight pause as questions queue. Once again, it is Star One and waiting aim to be announced. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sol Kavernek from Credit Swiss. Sol, please ask your question. Hi gents. Um just a couple of quick questions if I may, um particularly regarding just the scope for shipping improvements. I perhaps for just for some clarity here. Um I understand the brake bulk you're referring the the brake bulk option you're referring to, is that just that Pembroke report or is that also an option you're pursuing at McCullough? Are you possible to just give um some further colour on the potential scale of the volumes you could be uh getting out of tempo over the next six months. Yeah sure so uh apologies for my uh lack of voice uh at the end there. I was um just recovering from uh being unwell last week, so uh we'll see how we go on on questions. Um uh with regard to breakwall, um certainly the uh initial plans that we have in place um are out of uh out of PEMDA. Um there is the possibility of uh break bulk operations out of Nikala, but uh one of the issues at Nikala at the moment is ongoing um uh ongoing ingestion which is part of the issue for uh container shipments as well. So um the the initial uh plan is very much through Pemba. We've got good um uh plans and and set up in place and we'll see how the first shipments go and and we'll provide some further guidance around potential later volumes um as we move ahead. Thanks perhaps then if I could uh probe it this way. You talk about a ten thousand ton break up shipment for Pembot in February. Um d I mean to my mind that could indicate that, you know, we could get, you know, your fifteen K um um K T run rate almost entirely out of Pember if things progressed well there. Um would that be a a fair inference? Uh all things going well, Pember could PEBA capacity could Um as I said we'll we'll see how things progress, Paul, but certainly the combination of the two is is is pretty powerful. And you know, Nikala continues to be very important for us uh now and in the future. We have a number of customers who fake different sizes of shipments um and we need to be able to service both, but certainly putting Pemba and Nicala together um is is a pretty powerful combination at lifting volumes beyond fifteen thousand tonnes a month for sure. Thanks. And one last clarification. When you refer to kind of this spot volume out of Pember, um that's just referring to the port. It's still going to the same contracts. Is that correct, or is this also going to diff aerent market? Uh we all we are doing most of the um uh break bob shipping into the spot market um because they are uh under different logistics conditions, they are separate contracts um and and obviously um priced accordingly. Uh we might try my luck here, but can you give us any indication of what kind of spread we the difference in price you're getting or those spot volumes versus contract volumes? That you know, is weighting in at that five thirty. No, just to we've we've made uh some uh some commentary there about uh the December quarter uh weighted average price being at five thirty and obviously the the spot shipment being above that uh and strengthening significantly, so I'll leave it at that. Great, thank you very much. Our next telephone question is from the line of Mark Pichera from Foster Stockbroking. Mark, please ask your question. Yeah, hi Sean. Um yeah just a couple of questions. Um firstly on the FID for dailia, I was obviously earlier you previously said um you were looking at FID by the end of this month. Now you're starting in the near term. I was just wondering what the reasoning is there for for I guess the the the the slight delay and um and when you say near term, I gather is this in the current quarter and you know, would it be early or late this quarter? And then my second question is on the um the life cycle assessment you mentioned in the quarterly that a a third party critical review is yet to be undertaken. What are your thoughts there in terms of when you think you'll make this third party review and who would likely do that? Thanks. Thanks uh Mark. So uh with regard to the FID, um the technical commercial operational and funding elements of the FID review, um the processes around them are are well underway and progressing well. We recognise we communicated and and targeted January, but the processes are not completed yet. We will advise when when they are complete. They're expected to be be completed in the near term, and certainly you can read that as as within this quarter. There's no specific issues we're dealing with on that front. We're just working through the process to ensure we bring the best possible projects to execution. With regard to the um Mindairo um LCA assessment. The the potential for for third party uh independent review of um of the assessment um really then provides uh the potential for a for an additional amount of disclosure around specific comparison points. Um one of the things that you know we mentioned this previously on on prior calls is that this is this really is an emerging area. We've taken uh the most detailed and transparent approach that we uh could to um the full chain from Balama Gate to uh well Balama origin to to Cash Magate uh out of Vedalia. Um and we are waiting I think as well as doing the uh third party review um to see how others are continuing to uh describe these processes and making sure that the comparison points are fair and valid. So we'll work through that uh in conjunction with Mindairo, but we're really pleased with what we're seeing so far in terms of the general uh comparisons compared to China. Right. And and just a follow through on that, Sean, is this um I guess a key selling point in terms of some of your the potential off takers in terms of wanting to see see that L C A in terms of you know, making a decision, especially given the ESG somatics. Yeah, exactly. It's uh it's certainly you know all potential customers who are engaged with us around Baidalia ESV is is a key uh focus area for them as is supply diversification, as is quality and cost. So um this uh significant level of detail is something that that we are able to disclose uh to them under those processes. Um and certainly it's been very helpful uh on the way through so far in that differentiation. Okay, great. Thanks. And just a reminder, it is a star one to ask a telephone question. Our next telephone question is from Glenn Lawcop from Baron Joey. Please ask your question, Glenn. Oh Sean, good morning. Um, firstly I just wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the eighty thousand tons of sales orders. I mean, that's you know, over twenty five thousand a month for production. I mean, is that you've got to deliver that or you know, how does that work? I mean, is that just what you've got and that's for delivery over the next six months and nine months? Just trying to square the circle between that comment and your production rate at the moment. Thanks. Yeah, sure Glenn. The production rate uh has been constrained by by the inventory position, so obviously that's that's been key in developing uh the brake bulk option. Uh the um eighteen thousand tons of sales orders ahead of it so a mix of um previously contracted um uh term contracts and spot uh sales that have been made over prior months uh and and even more recently uh in uh anticipation of clearing some of the shipping issues and of course as I as I said earlier uh the new spot shipments done uh um spot break bulk shipments being done under new terms as well. So we are endeavoring to work through um the backlog as quickly as possible. Customers are all um uh essentially willing to take uh the material um even though it's been delayed uh because market conditions are incredibly tight, not just in China but uh but more broadly across um across the global market. So Sean is are you aiming to sell or ship eighty thousand tons and if you can get the logistics change to work? Is that is that the inference from that comment? Yeah certainly we're we're looking to get uh up above fifteen thousand tons as quickly as possible and to to be clearing through that um uh that backlog of sales orders for sure. Um we will have to continue uh uh booking new uh sales in in conjunction with uh clearing that backlog because um the the break bulk process um you know it gives us that opportunity to to mix the two uh to be able to clear um clear the backlog and and continue to um participate in in the current market. Okay, sorry, maybe I'm just a bit slow, but you mean even if you sell your your product inventory at twenty, that leaves you sixty which is twenty thousand a month. So is that sort of you know, if this sort of sales orders continue and you get another eighty thousand tons for the June quarter, you know, then you you've got to start pushing your business towards twenty a month in terms of well over twenty a month in production and hopefully logistics change stacks up. But it sounds like logistics is your bottleneck and that you your business needs to run at twenty plus thousand twenty five thousand a month if you can get the logistics chain to work. Is that what you're trying to tell us? Yeah. Other otherwise the backlog persists so, you know, clearly we're trying to um to work through that backlog and and have the logistics chain support us increasing production uh as quickly as possible to work through the backlog and continue to um uh satisfy new spot demand. So yes that's that's what we're saying. We're looking to um to try to lift that production rate as soon as um uh as soon as the logistics support is there. And and is that eighty thousand tonnes then if the logistics chain doesn't come through and you ship it in the June quarter, in the September quarter, are they priced on today or is it priced on delivery? Because obviously the price in six months time could be much higher and we just don't want to get we don't want to be thinking you're getting this big price lift on orders that were placed, you know, yesterday. Yeah, the weighted average price is is uh a mix of um pricing mechanisms, some of which were fixed at the time contracts were put in place, some of which are more related to timing of shipments. Um there will always be uh a lag uh and a difference between you know stock market price assessments and what our weighted average looks like across courts and and fines and as well as the timing of of prices being settled. But you know that is a clear strategy that we've had in place to ensure that we have a mix of mechanisms and a mix of um uh of different contract types uh so that we're not fully exposed to uh you know changes one way or the other in price uh all at the same time with every counterparty. Okay, that's clear. And and just the difference between the the brake bulk out of Pember and containers out in the cala. Yeah, I think both you know both shipping markets have been uh elevated, there's no doubt about that. This the single biggest issue for us has been the constraint of availability um uh over rates because you know stock market prices were increasing uh for for the product um faster than uh than freight rates and we just couldn't get enough m get enough uh capacity out of Nikala. So clearly the economics around um around brake bulk uh are different. You know, the cost cost structures are different. We have a shorter um shorter land logistics leg, um, you know, different contracting requirements around warehousing, stevedoring, etc., compared to container packing, but those economics have been taken into account and clearly at the moment it makes economic sense uh from a freight rate perspective and the overall logistics um costs uh to be undertaking these these types of shipments. Um and you know one very positive thing about this is if it um if it evolves successfully, you know, it opens up greater logistics opportunity for us in the future and it gives us exposure to slightly different cycles that occur through uh bulk shipping markets and container shipping markets. So could be very useful to us as as uh we continue in future. Can you put a quantum around one versus the other? Brake bulk shipping versus container? What's the dollar per tonne figure, please? Well what we said so far uh around uh the container freight rates on a on a per ton basis is that most of them have have more than doubled uh through this period of disruption. You know, clearly um some time ago we were talking about an average of around fifty dollars a tonne um on a container basis. Um it's significantly above uh a hundred dollars uh on average um across our destination suite um and the the component of uh uh break off freight um you know it's not it's not directly uh comparable because of the uh other logistics costs, but at the moment it's certainly competitive with those levels. Okay, so it's similar. And then just one final question. Just inventory obviously sounds like graphite inventory is is quite low, but do you have any visibility and sense on your customers' inventory of anodes and and even batteries in the chain, or do you think the whole chain is is quite quite low? Thanks. Wh production rates are at record levels in in China. You have uh constraints on import raw material supply. Um you have constraints on production capacity utilization. So um you know, in in the strange si situation where the Chinese uh anomaterial producers have actually produced at record levels, um, but to do so they've had to push really hard um to to to satisfy the demands um downstream and in doing so they've they've really put pressure on their raw materials inventory. So you know I think um there is potential challenge there in in terms of uh availability of anode material supply um as we head into twenty twenty two on a couple of those factors around um power costs, power disruption, availability of input material from the natural graphite side. Anecdotally of course we hear uh the the pressure um from the cell supply side that's being caused by both cathode materials and now starting to come through on the anode material side. Okay, thanks very much Sean. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to hand the conference back to Mr Schulder for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Well thanks to everyone for the attention uh today and as I said we look forward to keeping everybody uh up to date as we work through our uh final investment decision processes for Vidalia and uh keep everyone up to date with the very positive evolution of the upstream markets. But thanks very much for the attention. Thank you all for dialing in. You may all disconnect. Have a great day and goodbye."

      "baseline" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Pilgrim Minerals December 2021 quarterly investor conference call and webcast. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question via the phones, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Ken Brinsden, Managing Director and CEO. Please Thank you, Rachel, and welcome to everybody joining on the call and welcome to those who are participating via the webcast, especially those uh shareholders that have taken the time to join in is much appreciated. Uh here in the First Filber Mineral set office I'm joined by Dale Henderson, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Ryn, uh Chief Financial Officer, uh both of whom you'll hear from during the call. Also in the office here with us, Alex Eastwood, uh Chief Democratical Officer, General Counsel and David Hahn, our investor relations specialist. Thanks to everyone for joining. Well the backdrop to the quarterly call is one of strong demand, accelerating price, and in part Tilbury and Minerals responding, albeit with some production challenges evident and especially during uh the December quarter. Um we've been continuing to work on the acceleration of Kilgangora production and a very very, busy quarter as we started production at the Nugaju plant, that is for just to remind you the former Baltura facilities, and we brought on the Pilganant Pl Improvements Project, which is is complete and now fully tied in and we continue to ramp up the production at the Pilldam plant. In support of all that, a lot more site activity. And that includes relatively significant growth in mining volumes, which you can see in the production tables within the quarterly, albeit still having to go higher as we support production growth both in the short and the medium term. And customers obviously want more product. You can see that with respect to pricing. Pricing's quite incredible and that's something that I'll come back to talk to in in more detail during our commentary. Yeah, incredible results on our BMX platform um with respect to spot sales. Very, very strong pricing, especially in China, which is just reminding everyone is the world's largest lithium raw materials market and that's now spreading to international markets with pricing hitting record highs virtually every week. And that's translating very well to spodjamin, which which is part of what again I'll explain in in more detail um the reference prices at a headline lithium chemicals price and how that's playing to the value in the spogamine. I'm going to explain a bit more detail there to un so that you understand some of the dynamics in the market. The ramp up in production continues, albeit slower than we would like. Just to remind everyone, we're taking Peel Gangora production from approximately three hundred and thirty thousand Bogamine concentrate funds per annum to five hundred and eighty thousand spodjamine concentrate production, big production growth, and with that have come some challenges. But as always the the Pilboro Minerals team is working incredibly hard and carries some fantastic skills that we've learned over the years about how to bring that production on. Still targeting five hundred and eighty thousand uh spodgamine concentrate tons by the run rate by the middle of this year. However, both plants are still in their ramp up phase and it's that issue combined with the effects of difficulties in the labour market and then more recently immunity distribution of of the COVID virus here in Western Australia that means there is some risk to to our ability to produce as l as hard and as fast as we would like. Um but nonetheless, um you know a lot of work going on as I said and the Bilbera Minerals team carries all the right skills to to make it happen and we're obviously doing the best that we can. The POSCO Downstream Joint Venture was executed during the quarter, and we're now going through the completion criteria for the final formation of the joint venture in parallel POSCO themselves have started the early works um at the one young site and they've confirmed that they'll start uh the significant construction works um during the current course. So we're looking forward to their progress over approximately the next two years as we head to Oz Silver and Minerals first hydroxide production in joint venture with COSCO. So coming up, Dale will explain a bit more about what we're up to in both production and if we ramp up the plant and also production growth to the medium term. And Brian will follow up with some more commentary about cash flow generation and a little bit of a follow up to the cost story. So on that note, Dale, over to you. Thanks again and good morning everyone. I'll offer my commentary on on three parts. So firstly a little bit about the operations, a quick touch on on the reserve update that we did during the quarter and then to finish I'll provide some insight into the projects uh space and expansion plans which we've got coming up. So status uh operations it can described, uh it's been a growth quarter, uh, bringing on two operations, ramping them, starting to ramp those up both simultaneously. Uh so growth quarter, but we've definitely had some growing pains, and Ken mentioned the labour shortages are which are happening uh across the state. Uh Pilbara has not been immune to that and we have found uh some of those pains uh end to end through our operation. That being said, uh the cord has still had fairly solid production um at 84,000 tons at the low end of our guidance. Recovery, 62% average across both operations yet again slightly below where we wanted it to be. Now stepping through um the sub-set operation, from a mining perspective it was a quarter of of moving more waste as further plan, but not quite the volumes we wanted to achieve. Again, a function of of some of the labour shortages uh that uh our mining contractor is seeing. One of the consequences of this was was slightly compromised ore uh in in terms of feed ore to the plant, which translated through to slightly lower recovery than we had planned. So consequence there around mining movements. As part of the the response to mining, during the quarter Pilbara instigated our own mine fleet and and mobilized our own small owner operate fleet uh to support the Southbit operation which principally serves the Nugajoo plant. So if we kick that off during the quarter and please report that that start as well. So moving from mining and stepping into each of the processing plants. So with Tilgan processing for the quarter average of 65% recovery versus the plant of 35%, as I mentioned earlier, slightly off where we wanted where we wanted it to be. Uh the improvement projects package, which is the debottlenecking project for that plant, with construction complete, commissioned and we're really just moving through it an optimization phase as we as we look to ramp up and increase throughput through through that uh operation. From a cost basis uh higher than we wanted where we wanted to be, uh a consequence of of increased mine movements, uh some mine contract performance challenges that I mentioned and in the plant space uh the oil feed being slightly off where we want it and some delays around commissioning for for both plants, including some extended shutdowns. So um in in summary, quite a few contributing factors playing through through your cost impact. And Brian will speak to this in a little bit more uh detail uh later uh in his section. So moving from toolgand processing plants and now speaking to Nugajo, uh the the super cord was the cord where where you hit the ignition switch, uh so to speak, uh first concentrate from the core circuit coming through um an early October and that operation we're moving it through a stage ramp up with with core circuit first float uh to follow. Float circuit, we're on track to to effectively start that ignition switch of the circuit uh in this quarter. So ramp up uh slower than what what we wanted where we wanted it to be, uh some maintenance issues contributing there. But all said and done, good to get the wheels turning and production stone to flow from the operation. Last thing on the OLTS update, production guidance. You'll know from uh our update that given the labour challenges and some of the ramp up challenges we've had, uh we're we're commencing a review and we'll look to revise our guidance upon the our half yearly results uh when they come out in due course. And that completes the ops update. Um moving to part two on the reserve, uh just a a note there that during the quarter uh we did do a uh uh a significant reserve upgrade. So this was the combination of of bringing in the Altura uh reserve and resource and into the existing silver minerals one. So a big increase, forty seven percent um upgrade from the prior year to one hundred sixty two million tons. So huge reserve upgrade, which of course supports uh the ramp up we're doing and the progressive expansion plan. So, lastly the expansion plans, where are we at? So historically we've talked about expansion in terms of stage two and and incremental stages of stage two. We've uh dropped that uh naming convention and and chose to revert to more simplified uh labeling for everyone's benefit. Uh the P six eighty project, as it's now called, is the next incremental expansion beyond the ramp up that we're in the thick of at the moment. So this is to provide a hundred thousand uh tons additional to our total production capacity, bringing us up to six hundred and eighty thousand tons per annum. Where are we at with this project? Uh we're in the closing stages of study work and and targeting an FID uh in the June quarter, all going well. Beyond that, it's the P one thousand expansion project, which is as the name suggests stepping up to a hundred one thousand uh kilotons per annum in in aggregate production from from the operation and we're targeting FID uh for that expansion in the December quarter this year. And lastly, in the project space, the the midstream project, which to remind everyone, is the production of the value added high purity lithium chemical salts. The scoping study is is in a finalisation stage at the moment. We're also completing the economic evaluation for that and looking to announce that in the coming weeks. Beyond that uh scoping set announcement, we we uh positively disposed of moving forward that project uh with our partners Calix, uh ultimately to to commercialise um that that project and that approach and and bring what we think is a superior product to market. So what's the space and we look forward to updating on on that accordingly. So that's a wrap of Ops Reserve and Projects. And at this point I'll hand over to Brian. Well thanks thanks very much Dale and and good morning or good afternoon everyone. Um if I think about the uh the the financial impact of the the the quarter that we just had, I I sort of put it in in sort of three three three different aspects. One is obviously a very, very positive price environment, very strong operating margins generated, but with some of the operating challenges that Dale has just gone through, we've we've obviously had some impact in terms of higher unit operating costs. In terms of the the physicals, uh we produced just over eighty three thousand tonnes of sphogyine concentrates uh and solved about seventy five thousand tons of concentrate that was produced on the bilgam plant and about 3,600 tons of concentrate that was produced from the Magaju plants. So that some exputes an increase in inventory of about 5,000 tons and we we closed the quarter with closing stocks of about 16,000 tonnes, which which represents about um half a month's worth of production. In terms of price and operating margin, now I think everyone's aware it's been quite an extraordinary improvement in pricing over the last quarter. And we averaged uh a price of somewhere between US one seven five oh and US one thousand eight hundred dollars a ton on an SC six basis. And just as a reminder that, compares to a pricing of eight fifty to nine hundred dollars a time that we uh we achieved for September. So that's that's quite an extraordinary uplift in pricing. So with that uh with that pricing environments clearly um we generated a a much stronger operating margin. So our our our margin uh was about US one one five oh uh per diometric ton for each for the tonne sold from Pilgon to seventy five thousand tons from Pilgon. So with that strong operating margin, uh there's been a significant increase in the company's tax position. Um so the September cash position was about a hundred and thirty seven million dollars and that obviously we bought require cash, we quote cash plus uh the uh the L Cs as well for for shipments that occurred in the quarter. So September we had one hundred and thirty seven million dollars and at the end of December we now find ourselves at two hundred and forty five million dollars. So that's that's an increase of uh of uh just under one hundred and eight million dollars. Um so where where has that uh that increase come from? So with the cash operating margin that uh the Tilgham fund was able to generate represents about a hundred just under one hundred and sixteen million dollars for the quarter. We also uh through the tons that we sold at at Nagaj, even though you know Nagaju is still in ramp up and and commissioning phase, um, we actually still generate a deposit cash flow of about two two million dollars uh following the sale of the 3,600 tonnes from that statutory operation. Capital standard cost of business was about twenty, just under $27 million, and that's obviously money spent on the Pilgamp Plan improvements on the restart of the magnitude operation the commission and also on the the official waste mining that's currently uh being undertaken. Um but that was largely offset by the drawdown of of debt. So during the quarter we took the opportunity to increase our debt facility with with our banks by US twenty million dollars. Uh that was done deliberately to help us fund the the restart of the nuggets operation. So that that US twenty million dollar agreement was signed, signed up during the quarter and the monies were torn down in December. And that was uh represents about twenty twenty seven million Australian dollars. We also paid about two million dollars in um in interest cost on the debt and we also paid a cash sweep under these the debt facilities of about two two US million dollars as well. So at the end of the quarter, we end up with about two hundred forty five million dollars of cash, and that represents a a a net cash position, so net of debt of around about sixty eight million dollars. So clearly this quarter um has been a significant uh significant for the company and and places the company in a much, much stronger financial position uh than than we were uh at the start of the quarter. The the obvious the the the one downside if you like for from the quarter uh from a from a financial point of view is is is the unit operating cost. So the unit operating cost clearly has been impacted by the the challenging operating environment that we've that we faced during the quarter um and was US five hundred and eighty seven a tonne, um which is which was about at US one hundred forty two a ton higher than the unit operating cost for the September quarter. So that increase of of one hundred and forty two dollars, about fifty six US fifty six of that really relates to to royalty. So obviously if the uh selling price environment is is is going up, um we are paying a much higher royalty. So about fifty six dollars of that increase related solely through the fact that we are having to pay higher royalties as a result of receiving a high selling price. The remaining $86 is really attributable to the fact that we generated lower levels of spygeny concentrate production. And this sale alluded to really was as a result of plant shutdown to facilitate the time of the um of the plant improvement project up till now. Uh we have some unplanned downtime events to address um some maintenance and equipment issues that needed to be rectified. We also ended up with a with a lower recovery as as Val mentioned. This is right really due to the fact that the the the all fee of being presented to the pub wasn't wasn't as as optimal as it as as it should be. And then we were also impacted by the fact that there's just a lack of of mining production and maintenance personnel in in the market which which which impacts uh how the operation um gets Now, if I think about those cost increases, they are I think unique to the challenges that we're currently facing. I don't think they are necessarily something which is going to be a permanent increase and other than the the the higher already costs which are linked to the the selling cost, my expectation is as we as we achieve st to state production from the operations at those costs will come back to to the levels that we had guided to previously. However, as Dale mentioned before, we are currently undertaking a review of of our production and and and we whether need to provide our production guidance and if there is any impact of that production guidance on unit costs including we will we will make be making that disclosure at the same time in uh in late February when we when we uh release uh half your accounts. So I think that's uh that's everything I I wanted to go through. So Ken I might might hand back to you. Yes, thank you Brian. Thank you Dale. Um a bit more commentary about the market and in particular uh apologies in advance for delving into a little bit of detail about the pricing environment but I think it's particularly important to to explain how that works so that you have a greater understanding of the opportunities that the current market represents. Um obviously given where prices got to, there is a a growing disconnect between available supply and surging demand. Surging demand is driven by all those things that that represent opportunity in electrifying the global economy, but lithium ion batteries are now key to that, so hence the the growth in demand. On the supplier side, um without wanting to put words in other producers' mouths, I don't think their experience is necessarily any different to silver or minerals. It is tough to bring on additional capacity in an environment where you were previously being punished. Very low pricing environment had meant that that every producer had slowed down. Um so I think it's highly likely um that that on the supply side there will be challenges and it's probably the case that that the supply response is already being overstated. So it's against that that challenging environment that the price is is surging and um and it's and it's kind of perverse. But for the very same reason that silver and minerals had a challenging production quarter, you are likely to see a pricing increase because the supply response is insufficient. I hope that makes sense. On pricing itself, and delving into a little bit of the detail, PLAPS reported China domestic pricing in battery grade lithium carbonate of three hundred and eighty six thousand yuan per metric ton lithium carbonate equivalent basis. So that's over USD sixty thousand US dollars a ton in China. Now people will tend to want to dismiss that price because uh it it's I think somewhat unfairly described as a spot price. But what's actually being discovered in that price survey is the real price being paid by the same relationship, i.e. a long term seller and a long term buyer who are constantly renegotiating the price and volume. So what it is, well I think what it represents is the real price that the chemical conversion industry received in China. R you know, bearing in mind that China is the world's largest lithium raw materials market. And I think all the evidence points for that price being a real price because it's also driving international pricing, which typically has longer dated contracts. But international pricing um is already approaching fifty thousand US dollars a ton. So so for those that want to characterize it as a spot price, I think that's a little bit of a misrepresentation. It is the price that the chemical conversion industry receives. Well why is that important? This is where the the forgiveness supply base um ultimately have its stay in the fund. And I think Bilbera Minerals is particularly well placed to participate in that pricing environment. What it means is that if if a chemical converter is receiving $60,000 or over sixty thousand US dollars per ton for their for their battery grade carbonate. If you deduct the VAT and you deduct the cost of chemical conversion, they have approximately fifty thousand dollars left to spend on their raw materials. Fifty thousand dollars left to spend on their raw materials, of which spogamine is obviously a key component. What that means is that the chemical conversion industry can pay a lot more for spogamine, and in my view, they likely will, because there is no alternative. They already have chemical conversion capacity, of which there is oodles in China, but there is insufficient spodjamin to backfill the chemical conversion capacity. The net effect of all that is that they will pass their margin upstream, which means poljamene pricing is already very strong, but in my view, likely to get stronger. And I know everyone thinks that sounds like a pretty extraordinary scenario. But have a think about this. It's not iron ore. Phogamine is not iron ore. Spogamine and its derivative chemicals are part of an industrial mineral supply chain turning into a specialty chemical supply chain for which most players will already be contractually bound. They are contractually bound to sell chemicals to a cathode materials player or or a cellmaker, maybe in China, but equally probably Japan and Korea. They are contractually bound, but they don't have the raw material. And what that means is that they will pay virtually anything for the raw material. So the dynamic in you know that I'm describing is one that's very different to what most people might be used to in natural resources markets because you know if you took iron ore as an example, that's a very large liquid pool of available products. That's not what's what's represented by an industrial mineral supply chain where people are uh uh have built purpose built you know purpose built chemical facilities to match a combination of input raw material feed for a defined quality for a customer is probably a longer data customer downstream. So so all those dynamics create something that's very unusual in the pricing world when there's such a bad disconnect between available supply and surging demand. So so that's what's going on in forgy main markets, quite incredible. I think Silber and Minerals is really well placed. We're probably outperformed as it relates to price received in the December quarter. And the March quarter is already looking very, very strong. So we've guided for between two thousand six hundred and three thousand US dollars per ton CIF China on a six percent spodjamene basis because we see lithium chemicals pricing being very strong which represents a a key a key peg to our phogyamine price. So so yeah, incredible signs, um but nonetheless silver and minerals will be having its day in the sun. So that's the detail in the the Spogamine market. Um the other means by which we look to take advantage of that is through the the BMX platform. The BMX platform um will typically handle uh excess product from our Pilgangora production, uh most of which is coming through the growth in Nobajo production, which is coming. Um we've only been producing through the HMS circuit so far. We're continuing to trip away that and the flotation circuit with the expectation that the flotation circuit starts during the latter part of the current quarter. In which case we should have more product available for the BMX platform and we're looking forward to the price discovery that that flushes out. So, to close, uh in summary, um it's a challenge bringing on the two plants and the expanded capacity that they represent, especially in light of the the tight labour market um that WA currently suffers from. We're all looking forward to the borders opening because it's ultimately it should provide some relief through those tight labour market conditions. Um Firstly, whilst that was a challenging quarter, it's not just filter and minerals experience. We expect that just about every resources company is going through similar issues, including the other lithium raw material providers. What does that point to? Well it points to at least in part constrained supply, which points to probably higher price. We think we are really well placed to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Um, I'm confident in the team and their ability to to bring on the remaining capacity, um, in which case we will have a very, very good year. Rachel, I'm going to throw back to you. I'm sure there'll be plenty of interesting questions on the phone call, but equally some that'll come out of our webcast. So yeah, look forward to people's questions. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. If you wish to ask the question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star to. If you are on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Your first question comes to Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hello, Ken and Team. Uh just a couple from me. Um perhaps just starting with the recovery um across Kilgangura. Just wondering with uh Nugged you., Um when do you think uh what's kind of the expected maximum recovery you'll you think you'll be able to get there once you bring the floats online and what sort of time and business we might be able to um see that across? Yeah, Al, yep, so in the detail there, um Bill Game was compromised by the new equipment being brought on as part of the improvements project and the effect of a less than optimal blend. So that we experience recovery in a pill gun of sort of 65% versus 75%. And maybe The the recovery is materially lower while we're using just the HMS circuit with the transitional law. So nominally 30% recovery until we bring on the flow station circuit. Target recovery, so Nobby overtime with a fully optimised circuit is likely in the order of high sixties, seventy percent as compared to Phil GAN being seventy five percent for argument. So Yeah that's that's really helpful. Thanks again. Um just secondly, just on the FIDs for P six eighty and P one thousand, just I'm wondering how long after FID, if if they are successful, could works begin, just given the tight labour market you're seeing and just any commentary you have on the he perhaps percentage increases in Capex you've you've been seeing relative to prior studies? Yeah, I'll I'll try it now for Yeah, sure. I'll um add to the timing around uh starting execution of those projects post FID. Uh the good news is for the P six A it could be could be fairly quick. Um it's um that project is effectively an expansion to the HMS circuit. Um so the function of engineering and timing long leaves within construction could could be as soon excuse me as soon as six months starting as soon as six months post S ID. But we wouldn't expect um likely the the ramp up of that for maybe nine to twelve months post-FID. That's largely driven by our estimates around long leaves. As to capital increase and cost increases, we've definitely observed uh escalation uh uh across the board within the WA environment, steel prices and the like. Uh we haven't translated that through quite yet to to the to the CapEx forecast uh for these particular projects, but of course we will we will do that as part of the FID decision. Hope that answers your question. Yeah thanks Del and just maybe with the P one thousand, is is do you think that will have a a longer um e uh build time frame after FID, just giving us a bit bigger? The The w one of the questions we haven't resolved yet is is actually the staging of of that particular pilot expansion is potential that we might choose to forward order long leaves and the long leaves uh for for both those two expansions really drives the critical path not so much uh um and how do you uh uh uh labor um uh constraints as more long leaves and And uh as it relates to the um P one thousand, uh the good news there is uh we already have uh the H B D R for that circuit. Um so for us it would be really around looking at bore mill timing and and the float cells principally all the other things with uh a large man. So um we could be uh well placed potentially to move fairly quickly with that. Great, thanks thanks Dale. If I can just sneak one last one in. Just wondering if you guys have a rough um split of of um Pilbri's product it goes into hydroxide versus carbonate converters and and whether or not that's changed substantially since we've seen these bigger bigger increases in carbonate price inverse the hydroxide price. Yeah, our customers, uh the contracted customers do a mix of both, so it's very difficult to determine exactly how much goes into the carbonate chemical sweet versus hydroxide. But to be honest, in today's environment you could you could be amb ambivalent about it because any any um primary hydroxide producer, i.e. straight from Bodjamin to hydroxide, is probably twisting hydroxide to carbonate, a very low cost process of carbonation to take advantage of bowls for carbonate price. So and actually in the scheme of things they're doing that for roughly the same cost as the cost of chemical conversions carbonate anyway, um because the primary hydroxide route would typically be a bit cheaper. Um so from our point of view we're we're not overly fussed kind of one way or the other, we're ultimately being consumed. But given the price differential between carbon and hydroxide that's that's very much a likely market response twisting our drop size card in it. Great. Thanks Ken. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Ryan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. anything up there if you can have that refinery uh I mean some of you can the aspect products I know look for you could be an S platform as well. I was just wondering if that would be a material um earnings earlier if that would be a material for earnings. Yeah, good question, Mitch. And it's hard to disagree with the logic that says the more volume and the more price points that are established on such a platform, um the better the combination of price transparency and market development for more sophisticated market tools to emerge. So broadly speaking, we're supportive of of an objective that creates more product pricing on things like the B and X platform. Um so we're very open to those discussions and it won't surprise you that that those discussions, you know, are already underway. Seems like a very, very logical model to deploy and an e the industry is absolutely crying out for for stronger price of transp price transparency. So so in light of that I guess the the you wouldn't necessarily looking for for a commercial benef a a a m material commercial benefit, it would be more about the improved transparency of the market would benefit all players involved, I guess. That's right, rising tide f,loats or boats. So so yes, pretty much that that logic and and ultimately it's going to be good for the market as a whole to get more sophisticated sort of pricing methodology out there. Uh we're not interested so much in the commercial potential in in that model, just broad participation across all products and and in fact silver and minerals itself is also keen to put more price points on the platform, i.e. you know varying squadjamin grades and over time, midstream products and and who knows, uh maybe our own lithium chemicals over time. Yes, but thank second more question. for you Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Gabb from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thanks, uh and hi Kennethine. Um just a couple of questions from me. I guess firstly just on the the labour challenges and particularly with respect to um some of the stripping, I guess this year was gonna be a bit of a catch up year for the stripping rate. I'm just curious, is this gonna pose a a challenge at some point? Is it gonna create a bottleneck for you as you look to expand, or are you we've got quite a lot of um headway on that? And I'll just follow up with one more question. Thanks. Yeah, Jack, uh a couple of introductory comments on that subject and I'll hand to Dale. Um yeah, you're right, the the this year is all about catch up and we had about sort of fifteen to eighteen months worth of of um higher than life of mine strip to catch up. Uh that's necessitated mobilising more fleets and larger fleets. It's been constrained by Labour so so that's part of the challenge. So is there anything else you wanna you wanna add? Um the only thing I would add is with the acquisition of Eltura presents more opportunities in terms of access to all. So um without question there's a heap of material to move waste movements but uh we do have multiple areas to draw from um so that puts us in in fairly good stead as we as we think about our theories, mine plans, etcetera. That's all I'd add. Perfect, thanks. And then just one on pricing. Can you give us a sense of the the range I guess of your pricing that you actually receive across your contract, ignoring BMX for a second, um, within your guidance. And then secondly within that guidance as well, are you including any material volumes from the BMX platform at this point? For Q one? Thanks. three thousand US dollars a ton represents an estimate of contracted pricing based on what we see today. Um so it's only only contracted pricing excludes whatever might yet occur on the BMX platform. And I might just add up that there's probably a risk to further upside as a function of of if the speed with which chemicals have accelerated. Um oh uh yeah sorry the first question. Um actually it's relatively tight um contract pricing across the customer group. There's really no material difference emerging um in respect of the various pricing models. They've they've pretty much approximated each other within a couple of hundred dollars, you know, of of of each individual contract. Um and they do vary over time because they do use slightly different sort of pricing modeling but it's in the detail. They all reference uh lithium or typically all reference lithium chemical, potentially in a slightly different way, but the net outcome of the pricing is pretty tight. That's really helpful. Thanks so much, I'll um Libida. Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Kerr from the Australian Financial Review. Please go ahead. Um just wondering on the border. I assume you're not going to join the exodus of uh all the other W A based CEOs who are coming next. Um and secondly, with the February five delay, did that upend any plans you had in terms of, you know, did you have uh particular markets on the east coast you were targeting as of Fed six? And um yeah, how do you sort of cope now with that with that sort of indefinite uncertainty? Yeah, good question, Peter. Um I can assure you there was lots of kids in the Brisbane household um with the border. and and uh the desire to catch up with them. Um with respect to work, uh no not my intention to merge to Melbourne or or Sydney, uh not any time soon. And and did it disrupt plans? Well, the the i it's an indirect impact of the border that it constrains short term labor supply. So so that actually gets to the heart of a lot of the issues that we've been dealing with and especially while we're ramping up the two plants, when something breaks or when we've got to do a a shutdown, you typically can't get the labor, at least not in the way we used to, to create the peak load that's required to get the jobs done quickly. So a shutdown that should have taken um thirty six hours takes you know takes seventy two and a and a you know broken ball mill coupling takes takes sort of fifty six hours to to fix when it should have taken twenty four, you know, that type of thing. Um that that's really one of the key issues. And then our contractors, uh the mining contractors feel it as well. Um they typically have a slightly higher sort of transitory workforce and they're highly mobile. And what's happening now with everyone fishing from the same pool in that that contracted space, um and it it's leading to to lots of some uh you know, some challenges accessing labor and hanging on to labor for our contractors. So so yeah, if the borders being continuing to close creates challenges in that keep personnel and and the extent to which which our contractors can retain their personnel. So yeah, it's a big issue. Uh the sooner the borders open and we get the the you know, the the the the mobility back in the workforce is really the key. And so presumably you think the negative impact of those labour challenges is greater than the COVID impact will be when it starts spreading through your workforce, you know, as it as it is over here? Definitely some risk to to the production environment for WA mining companies. No two ways about it, but it should be relatively transitory. I measured in months, you know, a couple of months, not not six to twelve months. Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Baker from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. G'day Canon Team. Um yeah, just a question on the the mine grades. Um they've been above reserve grade at uh one point one eight percent for uh for quite some time. Uh just wondering uh, you know, what your mind plan is saying about uh you know coming back to meet reserve grade, you know, how far off are we from that? Yeah, good question. Um we've been reasonably clear historically that that Tilgan or that the original Tilgan Gore operation was always mining a slightly higher grade in its first four years, roughly, um of production. That's just a function of the way the ore presents at Bill Gangora. So um so nothing particularly sort of tricky there. But the lower reserve grade also r has resulted from the the addition of the South Pit, i.e. the former Al Jura operations, which again was always a lower reserve grade than the original Pilgangora reserve grade. Um so that also explains some of the gap. Um yeah, so uh we've been in production now for two or three years, so we've got another year or two worth of slightly elevated grades and um and then and then they'll start to revert more to the to the reserve norm. Sure, thanks that one. Um yeah, you mentioned that uh you know, there's gonna be the substantial reviews guidance uh with a half year result in every um I'm guessing there'll be some impact to the second half financial year twenty two guidance, but just wondering how likely it is to steam past the target of uh five forty to five eighty thousand tons of squad trumps by uh mid year. Yeah, more discussions come given that we've got about another four weeks prior to the half year results, there's several things going through our mind there and the next three or four weeks will probably be formative. Um the first is the effect of continued plant ramp up. There's a big gap between the historical production at 330,000 spoty main concentrate tons per annum compared to where we're going, 580,000housand squad genome concentrate funds per annum. And our guidance is tensive to the speed with which we can bring on that capacity. So we really need another three or four weeks to see how we go with the plants um and and the the you know the work that's already happened and integrating the the accommodation of new equipment, especially Navajo, um where we're bringing on the flotation circuit. Um, so that's part one. Um, as to absolute production capacity, i.e., five hundred and eighty thousand tons, well, you know, we're still confident about hitting that run rate in the middle of the year as a function of both plants and and their performance. So the bit that we're sensitive to is the remaining ramp up. Lastly, it's worthwhile mentioning the borders and COVID. You know, there's obvious community transmission going on here. Now mining companies are going to start feeling that. Um so we are a bit sensitive to to what that impact might be. Now indirectly it's already hurt us because we we struggled to get people peak as I described. Um but it's possible there's also production impact from the community transmission and how that relates to our available workforce. So give us another three or four weeks, ma',am and we'll have that largely cleared cleared up and um we'll provide more definitive guidance. Thank you. There are no further telephone questions at this time. I'll now hand over to Nicholas Reed for any webcast questions. Thanks, Rachel. We have a number of uh questions that have been logged online to the scene here. Um firstly uh some questions from John Beckworth. He says could you please expand on the company's uh strategy and the initiatives that have been put in place to deal with the current skills and labour challenges and risks in WA? Yeah, good question, John. And yes, of course there has already been actually significant response. So the first thing is to have taken on um some of the the challenge ourselves. Um Philbury Minerals has commenced its own mining fleet and the logic in doing that uh it's multifaceted, but one of the key drivers is the relative accessibility of longer term employees by filter and minerals as compared to our contractors. And it's all to do with the way the workforce works here in WA, most employees not all but most employees would say longer term employment with an established company is a safer bet and I think we also trade on the benefit of being involved in the new economy in mining, um battery raw materials which is seen as the future and and hence that that brand has a better um attraction and retention status. So so that's the key thing that we've taken on ourselves and um so far so good. We haven't had too many dramas accessing people um ourselves, but certainly our contractors have. Um there has also been um work done with respect to retention. So for example the way we pay our people, the the the bonuses, the net benefits, we've done work on our camp, you know, there's lots of things that have happened um that that should have the desired effect of both attracting and retaining people over time. With respect to our contractors, well we've done a bit more sort of innovative thinking with them. Again rosters, um you know the camp and and in certain circumstances the way they're incentivized, um, with a view to helping attract and retain people. The one key challenge which we still haven't really broken the back of is the peak labour that I described when you when you need th you know large numbers of personnel for shutdowns and or breakdowns. That is an area that's still of concern and uh and again not a challenge that we're dealing with on our own. It's a a broad a very broad issue for for the mining companies here in WA generally. I hope that makes sense, John. Thanks, Ken. Two to others from John he he asked um the fallback of the share price over the last week or so, uh how much of that would be attributed to the Broadroad Global Market correction and how much to investor concern about the risks and challenges that have been discussed today? And secondly, can you update us on how the company's thinking about dividend policy given the strong performance of financially in that recent times? Um well w with respect to um Dilbert's Fair Price, I I think it's largely traded in line with its fears. Um I don't think there's anything particularly special that's that's gone on there that relates to Pilbera minerals specifically. Um it wouldn't be unusual to have a pullback uh when well, when lithium stocks had run as hard as they had, um, but also taking into account broader sentiment issues in global markets. Um uh the spectre of inflation uh you know clearly led to a bit of a risk golf attitude and I I would attribute most of the share price movements, you know, to that to that effect. Um second question dividends. Oh dividends, dividends. Um yeah, well, um as described by Dale, uh we have a lot of um growth ahead of us, uh, which we think represents a you know a reasonable reinvestment in our business. Um that's important. Uh and ultimately depends on what the price does, but but price versus you know, cost will be one of our assessments as to whether dividends ultimately become part of the story for the medium term. So so more to be discovered in that regard, John, before we can be definitive about dividend streams. Thanks, Ken. Uh question from Rob Clark. He says with respect to your impressive balance sheet strengthening, does your midstream project warrant more resources and can you look at ways to increase the speed to market of this product? Also, can you please clarify if the product is being targeted directly? Oh, okay. Yeah, both both good questions. Um well we very much like the the midstream product and and Dale said, um I think your words are something like a a very competitive product or a compelling product for the market, something like that, huh? I can't remember. Anyway, I agree wholeheartedly, it is a compelling product for the market and recutting the spotch and supply train is going to be a a big part of the future of our industry um because there are more efficient solutions. So um we're working about as hard and as fast as we can on that project. Um really happy to be working with Calyx and their smart team. Um but it's still got engineering development to to to be undertaken and it's very difficult to to short circuit that. Um so more work to be done and probably more to be said about that as we look to publish the first round of engineering uh in the coming weeks? Um I think that's pretty much it. Yep, yep. Great. Uh next question is from Aiden Bearso Macquarie. It says, uh is the long term production target closely expansion still approximately one million tons per annum or have you made some changes to long term recovery assumptions? And secondly, what percentage of sales in twenty twenty two are likely to be on the BNX platform. Okay. Yep. Um Yeah, so long term production, Hayden, is still targeting beyond one million tons per annum of spot humane concentrate. And broadly speaking, you know, that should happen in the period sort of two thousand and the latter part of two thousand and twenty three, early part of two thousand and twenty four onwards. Now more work to be done from an engineering and a delivery point of view, but we have no doubt that Pilobangora as a production centre has that capacity and it will be a very important part of global supply. So yeah, very much still in the picture. With respect to recovery, it's actually no, nothing's changed. With respect to our views around recovery, consistent with previous commentary, slightly lower recoveries at Nobus U, just as a function of the way that plant works in comparison to to Pilgans. Um and and and a slightly lower head grade overall likely to be fed to nobody over time. Um but recovery is still the same and uh and the photation is still a very important part of the future at Pilgangora, um, whether at Pilgan or at Magadu. Um okay, so if I still intervention some sorry, sales for the VMS platform. Yeah. Um well there's still some uncertainty, so uh that's a function of how quickly we can bring on the remaining capacity at merger from a production point of view, it's still a relatively early phase because we're only relying on on HMS in the transitional ore. Um the flotation circuit uh construction is well advanced. Um we're into the the cells now and and still expecting that those um cells will be fired up from a construction point of view we're finishing off the the last of the construction in the cell to align it with our flotation technique. Um and a view that they'll be commissioned from later in the March quarter. So then the question is how quickly we can bring that on to bring on additional capacity because it's that capacity and and whatever we can stretch kill gain two that becomes excess capacity to go to the BMX platform. Um so it's difficult to be definitive, to be honest, Hayden, about what ultimately gets sold on spot uh this area. Once the plant is at full capacity, so five hundred and eighty thousand tons, then approximately two hundred thousand tons of that is available, you know, it's at our disposal to sell as we choose. And and at the moment we would choose to sell by far the majority of that to the VMX platform because pricing is going to be very strong. Chemical conversion industry is going to give away their margin to secure spodjamine supply, in which case spodjamine supply, you know, or pricing, um will surprise to the upright. Thanks, Ken. There are a couple of other BMX questions, so I'll just group them together and apologies if we're going over the the same ground here, but one was to confirm are you expecting a BMX uh option this quarter? Yes, that's that's uh yep. And the second one, if all goes well with the MobyGo plants, can you give some sort of estimate of how many BMX sales and salages in total would be expecting for this calendar year. comes on. Um, I can be more definitive about it once the capacity's been built out because then you would have approximately an option every every three weeks roughly, um, as represented by the the total excess capacity that makes its way to the stock market. Great. Thanks, Ken. Uh a question here from Mr. Mills. He says as the company moves relatively quickly to P six eighty and P one thousand, what concerns should there be or are there with with uh shipping movements to markets given global shipping challenges and increased costs? Oh yeah. Um well our experience is that we're we d we don't have difficulty accessing vessels. There's enough trade um and vessels available in our sector. Um Um that that we don't in particular have difficulty accessing the vessels themselves. It's just the cost of attracting the vessels that that's the issue. Um there has been some relief, uh a little bit of relief in this quarter with respect to shipping cost. Um we packed in shipping costs at about seventy to eighty US dollars a tonne. Um average shipping costs prior and from memory were about fifty five or something is that so it's come off um slightly which which is indicative of of more vessels being available. But again make the point. It's not so much that you can't get a vessel, it's just the cost of of the vessel itself. Thanks, Ken. Just a couple of market related questions to wrap up. First one from Mr. Zing. He he asked if he can offer some commentary on uh on the impact on the Lithian market of uh some recent developments we've seen, for instance the Rio Cinto project in Serbia and also some of the political changes in Chile and any potential ramifications of those developments for lithium supply. Yeah, um well the first thing that comes to mind and no disrespect to the analyst community, but it's easy to put supply numbers in a spreadsheet. It's not so easy to to deliver them on the ground. Um by the time you're doing that a lot more complexities come into play. Um you've heard from from Silver about difficulties in bringing in additional capacity. Well our experience with you know is not um we're not on our patent alone. Bringing on spot immune supply and lithium units globally is challenging. And especially when you think about the combination of of volume, volume growth and quality. And each of those are going to be overestimated in our view, um in which case markets will continue to be tight for for quite some time. We've heard many analysts say over the years that that the lithium markets will be oversupplied, that there's plenty of lithium in the world, but there's not plenty of lithium in the world that fits the right combination of location, quality of supply, accessibility to infrastructure, um, in the right jurisdictions that don't otherwise suffer from geopolitical challenges. Um yeah, I mean it's a complex world of of an industrial mineral supply chain that that doesn't want to be complex but but naturally is. Thanks, Ken. One final one. It's a related question, but a good one to wrap up on. Um this gentleman says major car manufacturers are talking big numbers for EV production through to twenty thirty. Is there enough lithium to achieve those production call patterns? Uh don't want to be trite, but car makers have been asleep at the wheel. Um they haven't been paying enough attention to the raw materials supply though in battery raw materials in the last five years. And it's coming back to hoard them because insufficient um incentive was placed in the market when it was really required and especially sort of in that period three to five years ago um to get to where we need to be today. So so not enough capital flowing upstream, not enough uh definitive off take agreements that tie up the supply chain, uh not enough interconnected agreements that that motivate the supply chain to to to be interconnected. Each of those things represents a a serious challenge for the industry that should have been solved some years ago but now needs to be solved and will take some years to to get right. Excellent. Thanks Ken. That's all from the I think I'm going to be able to thank you, Nick Rachel. It sounds like we're all done. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

      "reference" : "Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Pilbara Minerals-December 2021, quarterly investor conference call and webcast. All participants are in listen only mode. There will be a presentation, followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question via the phone, you will need to press the star key, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Ken Brinsden, Managing Director and CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you Rachel and welcome to everybody joining on the call, and welcome to those joining via the webcast, officially those uh shareholders that are taking the time, um, joining us, much appreciate it! Uh, Here in the mineral set office uh, joined by dial independent operating officer and Broad Financial. You'll hear from during the call also in the Chief Commercial Officer general counsel and <unk> uh, that's the relation specialist. Thanks to everyone for joining. Um, well the backdrop to the quarterly call is while strong demands accelerating price and product inaudible to mineral to respond a little bit with some production challenges and evince inaudible during uh, the December quarter. Um, we've been continuing to work on the acceleration of Pilgangoora production and a very, very busy quarter. As we started production at the Ngungaju Plant um, i-just to remind you, the former Altura facilities. And we brought on the Pilgan plants improvements project, uh, which is complete, and now fully tied in, and we continue to ramp up the production at the Pilgan plant. Uh, in spite of all of that, a lot more side activity. And that includes um, relatively significant growth in mining, uh volumes which you can see, uh in production titles within the quarterly, um all be it still having to go higher as we support uh, production growth, both in the short and the medium term. And customers obviously want more products. Um, you can see that we respect the pricing process quite incredible. And that's something that I'll come back to talk to in-in more detail, during our commentary. Um, yeah! Incredible results on our BMX platform. Um, With respect to spot sale. Very, very strong pricing, especially in China, uh, which is just reminding everyone is the world's largest within raw materials market, and brilliant international markets with pricing hitting record highs, virtually every week. Uh, and that's translating very well to inaudible which-which is part of what… again, I'll explain in-in more detail. Um, the reference prior to that headline, y-you know the chemicals price, and how that's flowing to the value in the sponsor main, I'll go to explain a bit more detail. So th-so that you understand some of the dynamics in the market. Um, the inaudible production continues, albeit slower than we would like. Uh, just to remind everyone, we're taking Pilgangoora Production from approximately 330,000 spodumene concentrates um, per annum to 580,000 spodumene Concentrate production, uh, peak production growth, and we've a… had some challenges. Uh, But as always, the-the Pilbara Minerals team is working incredibly hard, and carrying some fantastic skills that we've learned over the years about how to bring that production on. Still targeting 590,000 spodumene concentrate times by, by… it's a run rate, by the middle of this year. However, both plants are feeling the ramp up phase, and it's that issue, combined with the effects of you know, difficulties in the labor market, and then more recently, community distribution of-of the COVID bar in Western Australia, that means there is boundaries to-to our ability to produce as-as hard and as fast as we would like. Um, but nonetheless, um, you know, a lot of work going on as I said, and the Pilbara Minerals team carried all the right skills to-to make it happen! And we're obviously doing the best that we can. Uh, the inaudible demonstrated joint venture… was executed during the quarter, um, and we're now going through the completion criteria for the final formation of the joint venture, um, in parallel. inaudible So started the early work, um, at the one yard site, and I confirmed that they'll, uh, with the significant construction work, um, during the current quarter. Uh, so we're looking forward to their progress over approximately the next two years. Um, as we head to the Pilbara minerals first Hydroxide production, uh in joint venture with Pasco. So, coming up, uh, Dan will explain a bit more about what we're up to in both production, and if we ramp up the plant, and also uh, production growth, to the median term. And uh, Brian will follow up with some more commentary about inaudible generation, and a little bit of a follow up to, uh… to the cost story. So, on that note, Dale over to you. Thanks Ken, and good morning, everyone. Um, all of-of my commentary on-on three parts. So basically a little bit about the operation. A quick touch on-on the reserve update that we did during the quarter, and then to finish, I'll provide some environment for the projects, uh space expansion plans, which we've got coming up. So the inaudible operations, as Ken described: uh, expanding growth quarter, uh, bringing on two operations, ramping them… starting to ramp those up, both simultaneously. Uh, so growth quarter, but we have definitely had some growing pains and convention. The labor shortages of our training uh, across the state of Dampier has not been immune to that, and we have found, um those times into-into our operation. That being said, the cause is fairly solid production, um, and 84,000 tons-at the low end of their guidance. Recovery: 62% average across uh, both operations. A-again slightly below where we wanted it to be. Excuse me, through the inaudible operation. From a mining perspective. It was a quarter of-of moving more waste, um that-that per the plan, but not quite the volumes we wanted to achieve. Again function of, upon the labor shortages, uh that um… and mining contractors, as seen. One of the consequences of this was-was slightly compromised or the or, in-in terms to the farm, which translated through to s-slightly lower recovery than we had planned, the consequences around mining movement. And part of the-the response to mining, during the quarter, Pilbara negated our own blind fleet, and-and mobilized own small owner operator fleet, uh, to support the inaudible operation, which principally serves the Ngungaju Plant. So, we-we keep that all, uh, during the quarter and pleased to report that that started well. Moving from mining and stepping into each of the processing plants. So with Pilgan processing um, for the quarter, uh, average of 65%, the same recovery. This is the planet at 35. As mentioned earlier, just slightly off where we wanted… where we wanted it to be. Uh, the improvement projects package, which is the D bottle necking project for that plot with construction complete, commissioned, and it, really just moving through a-an optimization phase, as we… as we look to ramp up and increase throughput… through-through that uh, operation. From a cost basis, uh, higher than we wanted to… where we want it to be, uh a consequence of increased mind movements, um, some minging contract performance challenges, that I mentioned, and in the plant space. Uh, the offering being slightly off where we wanted, and some delays around commissioning to provide a plant, including some extended shutdown. So um, and in summary, quite a few contributing factors playing through-through to a cost impact. And Brian will speak to those in a little bit more uh, detail, uh, later, and innovation. So moving from to Pilgan processing plant, and now, speaking to Ngungaju. Uh, the-the December quarter was the quarter where-where you had the ignition switch, uh, so to speak. pUh, first concentrate from the call circuit coming through, um, in early October. and that operation, we're moving it through a stage ramp up, c-calling circuit, float u-up to follow. Slow circuit, we're on track to-to effectively start that emissions which are for circuit. Um, and this quarter, so… inaudible uh, following w- what we wanted… what we wanted it to be, uh, some maintenance issues contributing to it, um, but all said and done: good to get the-the wheels turning, um, and production starting to flow for the operation. Last thing on the inaudible production guidance, uh inaudible given the labor challenges, and some of the ramp up challenges we've had… our… we're commencing a review, and we'll look to revise their guidance, uh, to have early results, when they come out to course. So that completes so the update. Uh, moving to Barcelona reserve just a-a note there, that during the quarter, uh, we did do a significant reserve upgrade, so this is a combination of-of bringing in the Altura, our reserve and resource and-and to inaudible minerals one. So a big increase, 47% um, upgrade from the prior year, to 162 million tons, So, due to that upgrade, what you call support, uh, the ramp up we're doing, and the progressive expansion plan. So, lastly the expansion plans, where are we at? So, where I started earlier, we talked about expansion in terms of stage two, and an incremental stages of-of stage two. With a drop that uh, naming convention, and chose to remove… to more simplified uh, labeling, inaudible the p2680 project, I now recall, is the next incremental expansion, beyond the ramparts that we're in the thick of at the moment. This is provided 100,000 uh tons additional to our total production capacity, bringing us up to 680,000 tons per annum. Where are we at with this project? Uh, we're in the closing stages of de works and-and tagging it by the, uh, end of June quarter, all going well. Beyond that P1000 Expansion Project, which is, as the name suggests, heading out to 1000, uh kilotons per annum, and aggregate production from-from the operations, and we're targeting it by the… that expansion and the December quarter of this year. And obviously the project's space, administering um, project, which to remind everyone, is the production of-of the value added high purity, and chemical salts. inaudible is-is in the finalization stage at the moment. we're also, uh, completing an economic evaluation for that, and looking to announce that uh, up in the coming weeks. Um, beyond that uh, scoping study anouncment, we are uh, positively disposed to moving forward with that project. Um, with that partn Kelics ultimately, to commercialize um, that-that project and that approach, and-and bring what we think superior product to markets are. So, the ones of space and we look forward to updating on-on that accordingly. So, that's a rap up of inaudible reserve and projects, and at this point, I'll hand it over to Brian. All right, thanks! Thanks very much Dan, And good morning, or good afternoon, everyone. Um, if I think about the uh, the financial impact of the-the quarter that we just had, I-I sort of put it in-in sort of three-three-three different aspects. One is: obviously a very, very positive price environment, very strong operating margins generated, but with some of the operating challenges that-that was just uh, just gone through. We've-we've obviously had. Um, some impact in terms of higher, um, you know… operating costs. In terms of the-the physicals, um, we produce just over 83,000 pounds of spodumene concentrate, uh and so, about 75,000 pounds of concentrate that was produced on the Pilgram, and around 3,600 tons of concentrate was produced from the Ngungaju plant. So that uh, concentration increase inaudible of about 5000 tons, and we-we've closed the quarter with cloning stocks of about 16,000 tons, which-which represents about um, half a month's worth of production. In terms of price and operating margin, now I think everyone's aware, it has been quite an extraordinary improvement in pricing over the last quarter. And we averaged a-a price of somewhere between us 1.7 $5.8 $100 on an AC basis. And just as a reminder that compares to pricing of 850 to $900 time that we uh, pay for the term that's quite extraordinary athletes and pricing. So with-with their pricing environment, clearly we're generating a much stronger operating margins or margin was about us 115 metric tons per inch for the term self employed under 75,000 tons from Pilgan. Um, so with that strong operating margin. There's been a-asignificant increase in the company's cash position. Sp, this position will have a $137 million dollar amount, obviously we're gonna require cash required cash but the DLT, as well for for shipment that occurred in accordance with the $1377 million at the end of December, we now find ourselves turning $245 million dollars. That's-thats an increase of just under $109 million dollars. But that increase come from, so the-the cash operating margin and the trillion without generating revenue there's about 116 million dollars for the quarter. We also through the trunk that we sell and nitrogen even in ramp up and commissioning phase, we actually still generate a positive cash flow of about buying the salad and 3600 pounds for my particular operation. Capital has been acquired a business with about 20 to $27 million and money spent on the pilgrim plant improvements on the restart of the magnitude operation the commissioning and also on the visual waste mining is currently being undertaken. But that was largely offset by the drawdown of updates. is offset buy the drawn down of updates. So during the quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our debt inaudible with, with our banks by US $20 million. Um, that was done deliberately to help us fund the, the restart with the managing operations. So that, that year end $29 million dollar agreement was signed, signed up during the quarter and the moneys were drawn down in December, and that was, uh, inaudible 20, $27 million Australian dollars. inaudible paid about $2 million dollars, um, in interest inaudible and inaudible was paid a, a cash sweep under the, the debt facility of about 2, US $2 million dollars as well. So at the end, end of the quarter, we'll end up with about $245 million dollars of cash, and that represents a, a, a, net cash position, so net update of around about $68 million. So clearly this quarter, um, has been a significant, uh, significant for the company and, and prices have come in a much, much stronger financial positions, uh, then, then we were, uh, at the start of the quarter. The, the only… the, the one downside to inaudible for the quarter, uh, from a financial point of view is, is, is the intermittent operating costs. So the inaudible operating costs clearly had been impacted by the charging operating environment that we, that we faced during the quarter. Um, and was US 5 to 97 per ton, um, which was, which was about an US 140 per ton higher than the unit operating costs for the September quarter. So that increase of $142, about 56 US, US 56 of that really relates to royalties. So obviously it's the, uh, selling price environment is, is, is going up. Um, we are paying a much higher royalty, so that $56 of that increase remains solely true to the fact that we are having to pay higher royalties as the result of receiving a high selling price. The remain $86, um, is really attributable to the fact that we're generating lower levels of inaudible and inaudible production. inaudible, um, alluded to really was, as a result of trying to shut down to facilitate the tying of the Pine improvement project inaudible. We have inaudible, um, the maintenance and equipment issues that needed to be rectified. We also have with a, with a lower recovery as I mentioned, this is right… really due to the fact the, the, the inaudible been presented to the platform ordinance as optimum as it, as it should be. And then we were also impacted by the fact that there's just a lack of mining production and maintenance personnel in, in the market which, which impacts, uh, how the operations, um, gets, gets run. Now, if I think about those top increases, um, you know, they are I think, unique to the challenges that we're currently facing. I don't think they are necessarily something which is going to be a permanent increase. And other than the, the higher inaudible which are inaudible, my expectation is as we, as we achieve these type productions from the operations that those types will come back to, to the levels that we are prior to previously. As, uh, as Dale mentioned, um, before, we are currently undertaking a review of, of our production and, and whether we need to revise our production guidance and if there is any impact of that production guidance on unit costs and inaudible, we will automatically be making a disclosure at the same time in, uh, it might inaudible when we, when we have released our half year accounts. So I think that, uh, that's everything I, I wanted to go through. So Ken and Mike, I'll hand it back to you. Yes, thank you Brian. Thank you, Dale. Um, a bit more commentary about the market and, in particular, uh, apologies in advance for delving into a little bit of detail about a pricing environment that I think is particularly important to, to explain how that works so that you have a greater understanding of the opportunities that the current market represents. Um, obviously given my inaudible has got to, there is a growing disconnect between available supply, uh, and urging demand. Urging demands driven by, you know, all those being that represent opportunity in electrifying the global economy but inaudible are now key to that, but hence the gross in demand. On the supply side, um, without wanting to put words in other producers mouths, I don't think their experience is necessarily any different to Pilgrim Minerals. It is tough to bring on additional capacity in an environment where you were previously being punished. Very low passing environment has meant that, that every producer has slowed down. Um, so I think it's highly likely, um, that, that on the supply side there will be challenges and it's probably the case that there's a supplier inaudible already been over stages. Um, so it's against that, that challenging environment that the inaudible is, is surging. And, um, and it's, and it's kind of perverse, but for the very same reason that Pilgrim Minerals had a challenging production quarter, you are likely to see pricing increase because the supply response is insufficient. I hope that makes sense. On pricing itself, and delving into a little bit of the detail, Flex reported China domestic pricing in battery grade lithium carbonate of 386,000 yen per metro ton, lithium carbon equivalent basis. So that's over USD $60,000 US dollars a ton in China. Now people will tend to want to dispute that price because they… It's, it's, I think somewhat unfairly described as a spot price. But what's actually been discovered in that price survey, is the real price being paid by the same relationship by a long time seller and a long term buyer who are constantly renegotiating the price and volume. So what it is, so what I think it represents is the real price of the chemical conversion industry inaudible in China. R- you know, baring in mind that China is the world's largest lithium raw materials market. And I think all the evidence points to that price being a real price because it's also driving an international pricing, which typically has longer dated contract. But international pricing, um, is already approaching 50,000 US dollars a ton, so… So for those that want to characterize it as a spot price, I think that's a little bit of a misrepresentation. It is the price that the chemical conversion industry receives. But why is that important? This is where the spodumene supply base, um, ultimately, uh, has it stay in the front. And I think Pilgrim Minerals is particularly well placed inaudible in that pricing environment. What inaudible is, is a chemical converter. It's receiving 60,000 or over $60,000 USD per tons for there, for their battery grade carbon. If you deduct the VAT and you deduct the cost of chemical conversion, they have approximately $50,000 left to spend on their raw materials. $50,000 left to spend on their raw materials of which spodumene is obviously a key component. What that means is, that the chemical conversion industry can pay a lot more for spodumene, and in my view, they likely will. Because there is no alternative. They'd already have chemical conversion capacity, of which there is inaudible in China, but there is insufficient spodumene to backfill the chemical conversion capacity. The net effect of all that, is that they will pass their margin upstream. Which means spodumene pricing is already very strong, but in my view likely to get stronger. And I know everyone thinks that sounds like a pretty extraordinary scenario, but have a think about this. It's not iron ore. Spodumene and it's derivative chemicals are part of an industrial mineral supply chain turning into a specialty chemical supply chain for which most suppliers will already be contractually bound. They are contractually bound to sell chemicals to a inaudible materials player, or, or a spell maker, maybe in China but equally probably Japan and Korea. They are contractually bound, but they don't have the material. And what that means is that they will pay virtually anything from the raw material. So the dynamic in th- you know, that I'm describing is one that's very different to what most people might be used to in natural resources markets because, you know, if you took iron ore as an example, that's a very large liquid pool of available product. That's not what, what's represented by an industrial minerals supply chain where people are, um, have built purpose… you know, purpose build chemical facilities to match a combination of import raw materials fee for a defined quality to a customer, there's probably a inaudible trust in the down stream. So, so all those dynamics create something that's very unusual in the pricing world when there's such a bad disconnect between available supply and surging demands. So, so that's what's going on in spodumene markets. Quite incredible. I think Pilgrim Minerals is really well placed. We've probably outperformed as it relates to price received in the December quarter. And the March quarter is already looking very, very strong. So we've guarded to between 2,600 and 3,000 US dollars a ton CIF China on a 6% spodumene basis. Um, because we see lithium chemicals pricing being very strong which represents a, a key, a key peg to our spodumene price. So, so yeah. Incredible times. Um, but nonetheless, Pilgrim Minerals will be having it's day in the sun. So that's the detail in the, the spodumene market. The other means by which we look to take advantage of that is through the, the BMX platform. The BMX platform, um, will typically handle, uh, excess products from our inaudible production, most of which is coming through the inaudible in overdue production, which is coming. We've only been producing through the H&S circuits so far. Um, we're continuing to strip away that and this location circuit with the expectation that this location starts during the latter part of the current quarter. Um, in which case we should have more product available for the BMX platform, um, and we're looking forward to the price discovery that that flushes out. So, to close. Uh, in summary, um, it's a challenge bringing on the two plants and the expanded capacity that they represent, especially in light of, but the type inaudible market, um, that WA currently suffers from, we're all looking forward to the borders opening because it's ultimately, it should provide some relief to those type labor market conditions. Um, inaudible whilst with a challenging quarter, uh, it's not just Pilgrim Minerals experience, we expect that just about every resources company is going through similar issues, including the other, uh, the other lithium raw material providers. What does that point to? Well it points to, at least in part, constraint supply, which points to probably higher price. We think we are really well placed to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Um, I'm confident in the team and their ability to, to bring on the remaining capacity. Um, in which case we will have a very, very good year. Rachel, I'm going to throw it back to you. I'm sure that we've plenty of interesting questions, uh, one phone call but equally some that will come out of our webcast. So, yeah, look forward to people's questions. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press start two. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Your first question comes from Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hey guys, Ken and team. Uh, just a couple from me. Um, perhaps just starting with the recovery, um, across Pilgangoora. Just wondering with, uh, Ngungaju, when do you think… uh, what's kind of the expected maximum recovery you'll think you'll be able to get there once you bring the inaudible online. And what sort of timing do you think we might be able to, um, see that across? Yeah, Al, yeah so in the details there, um, Pilgan was compromised by the new equipment being brought on as part of the improvements project and the effect of a less than optimal blend. Um, so that we experienced recovery at Pilgan at sort of 65% versus 75%. Uh, at Ngungaju, the recovery was materially lower while we're using inaudible silica with the transitional ore. So nominally, 30% recovery until we bring on the inaudible circuits. Target recovery for Ngungaju over time, with a fully optimized circuit, is likely in the order of high 60s, 70% as compared to Pilgan being 75% per inaudible, so. Yeah, that's really helpful. Thanks Ken. Just secondly, just on the FID sort of inaudible and P1000, just I'm wondering, how long after FYC, if, if they are successful, could work in the, given the inaudible labor markets your seeing. And just any commentary on the perhaps percentage increase s in capex. You've been staying relatively priced. Yeah. So, I'll try to inaudible. Into the timing around inaudible target execution of the inaudible posted by the. The good news is for the P6A could be, could be fairly quick, um, it's been a, that project is effectively an expansion to the HMS inaudible. Um, so the function of engineering timing normally inaudible construction could, could be soon. Could be as soon as six months, starting as soon as six months inaudible. But we wouldn't expect, um, likely, the, the ramp up of that for maybe 9 to 12- unlikely that the ramp up of that, so maybe nine to 12 months post- FID. Um, that's largely driven by our estimates around long leads. Um, as to, uh, capital, um, increase and cost increases, uh, we've definitely observed, uh, escalation a- a- across the board. That's in the WA environment, steel prices and the like. Uh, we haven't translated that through quite yet t- to the, to the CapEx forecast for this particular project, but of course we will, we will do that, uh, by, by the FID decision. Hope that answers your question now. Yeah, thanks, Dale, and just maybe with the P1000, d- do you, you think that will have a, a longer, um, a build time frame after FID just given that it's bigger? The, well, one of the questions we haven't resolved yet is, is actually the staging of, of that particular part of expansion. It's potential that we might uh, choose to forward order long leads and the long leads of the both those two expansions really drives the critical part, it's not so much, uh, in our view of a labor, um, um, constraint. It's more long leads, and uh, as it relates to the, um, P1000. Uh, the good news there is, uh, we already have, uh, the HPGR for that circuit. Um, so for us, it would be really around looking at bore mill, timing, and, and deployed cells principally. All the other things are, are largely in hand. So, um, we could be, uh, well placed potentially to merge fairly quickly with that one. Great. Thank- thanks, Del. If I can just sneak one last one in, just wondering if you guys have a rough, um, swift of product that goes into hydroxide versus carbonate converters, and, and whether or not that was changed substantially since those bigger, bigger increases in carbonate frothing versus the hydroxide froth? Yeah, our customers, the contracted customers do a mix of both, so it's very difficult to determine exactly how much goes into the carbonate chemical suite versus hydroxide. But to be honest, in today's environment, you can, you can be ambi- ambivalent about it because any, any, um, primary hydroxide producer, IE straight from inaudible hydroxide it's probably three things, hydroxide through carbonate, a very low cost process of carbonation to take advantage of, of the carbonate price. So, and actually in the scheme of things, they're doing that for us with the same cost of, cost of chemical conversion carbonate anyway, um, because the primary hydroxide route would typically be a bit cheaper. Um, so from our point of view, we're, we're not overly fussed kind of one, one way or the other. We're ultimately being consumed, but given the price differential between carbonate and hydroxide, that, that's very much a likely market response twisting hydroxide to carbonate. Great, thanks Ken. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Ryan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Uh, good morning guys, just inaudible. Yeah, good question, Mitch, and it's hard to disagree with the logic that there's a small volume and a small price point that are established on such a platform. Uh, the better the combination of price transparency and market development for more sophisticated market tools to emerge. So broadly speaking, we're supportive of, of an objective that creates more products pricing on things like the BMX platform. Uh, so we're very open to those discussions, and it won't surprise you that those discussions, you know, are already underway. It seems like a very, very logical model to deploy, and it is the industry is absolutely crying out for, for stronger price, price transparency. inaudible you wouldn't necessarily be looking for a commercial benefit. I mean, a material commercial benefit, it would be more about the improvement, going to the market would benefit all players involved, I guess. That's right. Right in time, floats four boats. So, so yeah, it's pretty much that, that logic, and, and ultimately it's gonna be good for the market as a whole, because it gets more sophisticated methodology out there. Uh, we're not interested so much in the commercial potential, in, in that model. We're more interested version across all products, and, and in fact, Tilburn Minerals itself is also keen to put more cross points on the platform, IE, you know, exploring grades over time, and midstream products, and, and who knows. Uh, maybe our own lithium chemicals over time. Thanks, Ken. Thanks for answering my questions. Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Gabb from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thanks. Uh, hi Ken. Uh, just a couple of questions from me. Firstly, just on the labor challenges, and particularly with respect to, uh, some of the stripping, I guess. This year was gonna be a bit of a catch up year for, for stripping rates. I'm just curious, is it going to pose a, a challenge at some point? Is it going to create a bottleneck for you, as you look to expand, or are you, have you got quite a lot of, uh, headway on that? Just that on my question, thanks. Yeah, Jack, a couple of introductory comments on that subject, and I'll hand to Dale. Yeah, you're right, this year, it was all about catch up, and we had about sort of 15 to 18 months worth of, of, uh, higher than light of mine strip to catch up. Uh, that's, that's dissipated, mobilizing more fleet, and larger fleet. It's been constrained by labor, so, so that's part of the challenge. Dale, is there anything else you want to add? Uh, the only thing I would add is, with the acquisition of Altura, for them more opportunities, with the access to all, so, uh, without question, there's a heap of material for ways movement, but, uh, we do have multiple areas to draw from, uh, so that puts us in fairly good stead as we think about various mine plans, et cetera. That's what I'd add. Perfect, thanks. And then just one on pricing. Can you give us a sense of, uh, the range, I guess, of your pricing, that you actually are seeing across your contracts, ignoring the BMX for a second, uh, within your guidance? And then, secondly, within that guidance as well, are you including any material volumes from the BMX platform at this point? Thanks. Uh, so Jack, on the second question first. Uh, in fact what we have described in the quarterly, 2600 to 3000 US dollars a pound represents an estimate of contracted pricing. So, uh, what we see today. Uh, so it's only, only contracted pricing excludes whatever might yet occur on the BMX platform. Uh, and I understand that there's probably a rich further outside of the function of the speed with which chemical has accelerated. Uh, oh, and yeah, sorry, the first question. Uh, actually, it's a relatively tight, uh, contract pricing across the customer group. There's really no material difference emerging, uh, in respect of the various pricing models. So that's pretty much approximated each other, within a couple of hundred dollars, you know, of, of each individual contract. Uh, and they do vary at a time, because they do use lots of different pricing modeling, but it's in the data. They all reference, uh, lithium… well, technically all reference lithium chemical. Uh, potentially that's a slightly different way, but the net outcome of the pricing is pretty tight. Thanks for your help, all. Thanks very much. I'll, uh, leave it there. Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Ker from the Australian Financial Review. Please go ahead. Good day Ken, thanks for your time. Uh, just wondering on the border, I assume you're not going to join the exodus of, uh, all the other inaudible who are coming next. Uh, and secondly, with the February fires delay, did that upend any plans you had in terms of, you know, did you have, uh, particular markets on the east coast you were targeting, as of Feb 6th? And, uh, yeah, how do you sort of cope now, with that, with that sort of indefinite uncertainty? Yeah, good question, Peter. Uh, I can assure you there was lots of cares in the Brisbane household, uh, with the border. Don't shut, February fires, given their locations, and, and, uh, the desire to catch up with them. Uh, with respect to work, uh, no, not my intention to merge with Melbourne, or, or Sydney. Uh, not any time soon. And didn't disrupt plans, well, the indirect impact of the border, that constrains short term labor supply, so they don't actually get to the heart of a lot of the issues that we've been dealing with, and especially while we're ramping up the two plants. When something breaks, or when we've got to do a, a shutdown, you typically can't get the labor, at least not in the way we used to, to create the peak load that's required to get the jobs done quickly. So a shutdown that should have taken, uh, 36 hours, takes, you know, takes 52, and, uh, and a, you know, broken bore nail coupling takes, takes sort of 56 hours to, to fix, when it should have taken 24. You know, that type of thing. Uh, that, that's really one of the key issues, and then our contractors, the mining contractors, feel it as well. Uh, they typically have a slightly higher sort of transitory workforce, and they're highly mobile, and what's happening now is everyone's fishing from the same pool in that, that contract that's stayed, uh, and it's leading to lots of, uh, you know… it's a challenge of accessing labor and hanging onto labor for our contractors. So, so yeah. It's, the border's been continued to close creates challenges in that key personnel, and, and the extent to which, which our contractors can retain their personnel. So the, it's a big issue. Uh, the sooner the border's open, and we get the, the, you know, the, the mobility back in the workforce is really the key. And so presumably you, you seen the negative impact of those labor challenges is greater than the COVID impact will be when it starts spreading through your workforce, you know, as it, as it is over here? Definitely some risk to, to the production environment, the WA mining companies, no two ways about it, though it should be relatively transitory, IE measured in months. You know, a couple of months, not, not six to twelve months. Thanks Ken. Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Baker from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. Good day Ken and team. Uh, yeah, just a question on the, the mine grades. Uh, they've been above reserve grade at, uh, 1.18%, uh, for quite some time. Uh, just wondering, uh, you know, what your inaudible saying about, you know, coming back to meet with the reserve grade, you know, how far off are we from that? Yeah, good question to pick up, Adam. Uh, I'd say we're reasonably clear, historically, that Pilgan, or, or the original Pilgangoora operation was always mining a slightly higher grade in the two or four years, roughly, uh, of production. Uh, that's rather a function of the way the ore presents at Pilgangoora. So, uh, so nothing's particularly sort of tricky there. Uh, but the lower reserve grade, also, hasn't resulted from the, the addition of the south pitch, IE the former Altura operations, which again was always a lower reserve grade than the original Pilgangoora reserve grade. Uh, so that also explains some of the gap. Uh, yeah, so, uh, with being in production there for about two or three years, so we've got another year or two worth of slightly elevated grades, and, uh, and then, and then they'll start to revert more to the, to the reserve north. Sure, thanks for that. Uh, to inaudible, yeah, you mentioned that, uh, you know, there's going to be a, a potential review to go with the half year result in February. I'm just wondering to the impact to the second half financial year 2022 got us, but just wondering how likely it is to impact the target of 540 to 580 inaudible by mid year. So, yeah. Yeah, all discussions come, you don't know we've got about another four weeks prior to the half year as well. There are several things going through our mind there, and the next three or four weeks will probably be informative. Uh, the first is the effect of continuous planning. Uh, there's a big gap between the historical production at 300, 30,000, inaudible tons per annum, compared to where we're going, 580,000 inaudible concentrate tons per annum, and that guidance has been reviewed to the speed with which we can bring on that capacity. Uh, so we really need another three or four weeks to see how we go with the patch, uh, and, and, you know, the work that's already happened, and integrating the combination of new equipment, especially targeted to, where we're bringing on the operations circuit. Uh, so that's part one. Uh, as to absolute production capacity, a 580,000 tons will, you know, we're still confident about getting that run rate, even the middle of the year, uh, as a function of both tax, and, and their performance. So, so the figure we're sensitive to is the remaining ramp up. Uh, lastly, it's worthwhile mentioning the borders and COVID. You know, there's obvious community transmission going on here now. Mining companies are going to start feeling that. Uh, so we are sensitive to, to what that impact might be. Now indirectly, it's already hurt us, because we, we struggled to get these people, as I described. Uh, but it's possible there's also production impact from the community transmission, and how that relates to our available workforce. So, given- To our available workforce. So give us another three or four weeks knowing we'll have that largely cleared, cleared up, and, um, we'll provide a more definitive guide. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. There are no further telephone questions at this time. I'll now hand over to Nicholas Reid for any webcast questions. Thanks Rachel, we have a number of, uh, questions that have been logged online to the team here. Um, firstly, uh, some questions from John Beckworth. He says, Could you please expand on the company's, uh, strategy and the initiatives that have been put in place to deal with the current skills and labor challenges and risks in WI? Yeah, a good question, John, um, and, yes, of course there has already been actually significant response. Um, so the first thing is to taken on, um, some of the, the challenge I feel, um, inaudible Minerals have commenced its own mining fleet. And the logic in doing that, uh, it's multifaceted. But one of the key drivers is the relative accessibility of longer term employees by inaudible and Mineral as compared to our contractors. Um, and it's all to do with the way the workforce works here in WA. Most employees, not all, but most employees would say longer term employment with an established company is a safer bet. And I think we also trade on the benefits of being involved in the new economy in mining, um, factory raw materials, which is seen as the future and hence that, that brand has a better, um, attraction and retention status. So that's the key thing that we've taken on ourselves, and, uh, so far so good, we haven't had too many traumas accessing tables, uh, ourselves, but certainly our contractors have. Um, there has also been, um, work done with respect to retention. So for example, the way we pay our people, the bonuses and their benefits, we've done work on our camp, you know, there's lots of things that have happened, um, that, that should have the desired effect of attracting and retaining people over time. Um, with respect to our contractors, we've done a bit more sort of innovative thinking with them. Again, roosters, you know, um, you know, the can and, and in certain circumstances, the way they're incentivized, um, with a view to helping attract and retain people. The one key challenge, which we still haven't really broken, the backlog, is the peak labor that I described when you, when you need this, you know, large numbers of personnel to shut down and or break down. Um, that is an area that's still our concern. And, uh, and again, not a challenge that we're dealing with on our own, it's a, it's a broad, a very broad issue for, for the mining companies here in WA generally. I hope that makes sense, John. Thanks James. Two, two others from John here. Um, the forego in the share price over the last week or so, uh, how much of that did you distribute to the global market correction, and how much to invest to concern about the risks and challenges that been discussed today? And secondly, can you update us on how the company's thinking about dividend policy, given the strong forms financially based on time. Um, well, with respect to, um, diversity and that I think it's largely trading in line with its fears. Um, I don't think there's anything particularly special that has gone on there that relates to silver and mineral specifically. Um, it wouldn't be unusual to have a pullback, uh, when, well, when lithium stocks had run as hard as they had, um, but also taking into account broader sentiment issues in global markets. Um, uh, the specter of inflation, uh, you know, has clearly led to a bit of a risk off attitude and I would attribute most of the share price movements, you know, to that, to that effect. Um, second question is- Dividends. Uh, dividends, dividends, um, yeah, well, um, as described by Dale, uh, we have a lot of, um, growth ahead of us, uh, which we think represents a, you know, a reasonable reinvestment in our business. Um, that's important, uh, and ultimately depends on what the product does, but, but inaudible you know, cost will be one of their assessments as to whether dividends ultimately become part of the story for the medium term. So, so more to be discovered in that regard, uh, John, before we can do this interview about dividend stream. Thanks James. Uh, question from Rob inaudible. He says, With respect to your impressive balance sheet strengthening, does your midstream project find more resources and can you look at ways to increase the market of this product? Also, can you please clarify if the product is being targeted directly at Chinese LCS inaudible? Oh. Okay. That's a, a good question. Um, well, we very much like the, the midstream product and, and Dale said, um, I think the word is something like a very competitive product or a compelling product for the market, something like that. I can't remember. Anyway inaudible compelling product in the market and reach out in this inaudible supply chain is going to be a, a big part of the future of our industry. Uh, because there are more efficient solutions. So, um, we're working with our partners fast as we can on that project. Um, really happy to be working with Calyx and their smart team. Um, but it's still got engineering development to, to, to be undertaken, and it's very difficult to, to short circuit that. Um, so more work to be done and probably more to be said about that as we look to publish the first round of engineering, uh, in the coming weeks. Um, I think that's pretty much it. Thank you. All right. Uh, next question is from Hayden inaudible says, uh, Is the long term production targets, post the expansion, still approximately 1 million tons per annum? Or have you made some changes to long term recovery assumptions? And secondly, what percentage of sales in 2022 are likely to be on the next platform? Okay. Yep. Um, yeah, so, long term production, Hayden, is still targeting beyond one million tons per annum of inaudible concentrate, and broadly speaking, you know, that should happen in the periods of two thousand and, the late part 2023 to 2024 onwards. Um, now, more work to be done, um, from an engineering and a delivery point of view. Um, but we, we have no doubt that Pilgangoora as a production center, um, has that capacity. And it will be a very important part of the globe abroad so yes, very much still in the future. Um, with respect to recovery it's actually no, nothing's changed, um, with respect to our views around recovery. Um, consistent with previous commentary, um, slightly lower recoveries at Naga due to the function of the way that plant works in comparison to, to Kilgan. Um, and, and, and slightly lower head grade overall likely to be said to, you know, do overtime. Um, but recoveries still the same and, uh, and the flotation's still a very important part of the future at Pilgangoora. Um, whether at Pilgangoora or at inaudible Um, okay, crosstalk- crosstalk sorry inaudible yeah. Um, well, there's still some uncertainty. So, uh, that's a function of how quickly we can bring on the remaining capacity at inaudible from a production point of view, it's still relatively early days because we're only relying on, on HMS in the transitional or, um, the flotation circuit construction is well advanced. Um, we're into the, the sales now and, and still expecting that those, um, sales will be fired up from a construction point of view and finishing off the, the last of the construction in the sales to align it with our flotation techniques. Um, and a view that they'll be commissioned from later in the March quarter. Um, so then the question is how quickly we can bring that on to bring on additional capacity because at that capacity and, and whatever we can stretch to gain too, that becomes excess capacity to go to the next platform. Um, so it's difficult to be definitive, to be honest, Hayden, about what ultimately gets sold on spot. Uh, this half, once the plant is at full capacity, so 580,000 tons, then approximately 200,000 tons of that is available, you know, at our disposal to sell as we choose. And, and at the moment we would choose to sell by far the majority of that to the BMX platform because pricing is going to be very strong. Chemical conversion industry is going to give away their margins to secure inaudible management supply in which case, inaudible management supply, you know, or pricing, um, will surprise the outside. Thanks James. There are a couple of other BMX questions so I'll just group them together, and apologies, we're going over the same ground here. But one was to extend concern are you expecting the BMX, uh, option this quarter? Yes, that's, that's right, yeah. And the second one was if all goes well with the magnitude files, can you give some sort of estimate of how many BMX files and senators in total that you're expecting for this calendar year? Uh, yeah, just similar to my, my previous comments about the speed with which the Navigator client comes on, um, I can be more definitive about it once the capacity then builds out because then you would have approximately an option every, every three weeks roughly, um, as represented by the, the total active capacity that makes its way to the spot market. Great, thanks Ken, uh, a, a question here from inaudible he says, As the company moves relatively quickly to inaudible 1,000, what concerns should there be or why are they with, with, uh, shipping movements to, to markets given viable shipping challenges and increased costs? Uh, yeah, um, well, our clearance is that we're, we're, we don't have difficulty accessing vessels that are not trade, um, and vessels available in our sector, um, that, that we don't inaudible have difficulty accessing the vessels themselves, it's just the cost of attracting the vessels that's the, the issue. Um, there has been some relief, uh, a little bit of relief in this quarter with respect to shipping costs. Um, we take in shipping costs at about 70 to 80 US dollars a ton. Um, average shipping costs from, from memory are about 55 or crosstalk- Yeah, yeah. So it's come off, um, slightly, which, which is indicative of, of more of that thing's that available, but again, to make the point, it's not so much that you can't get a vessel, it's just the cost of the, of the vessel itself. Thanks James, just a couple of market-related questions to wrap up, first one from Mr. inaudible he asks if you can offer some commentary on, uh, on the impact on the lithium market after some recent developments we've seen, for instance, the Rio Tinto project in Serbia, and also some of the political changes in Chile. And any potential ramifications of those developments for lithium supple. Yes, um, well, first thing that comes to mind, and no disrespect to the analyst community, but it's easy to put supply numbers in a spreadsheet, it's not so easy to deliver them on the ground. Um, by the time you're doing that a lot more complexities come into play, uh, you've heard from, from Tilbara about difficulties in bringing in additional capacity. Well, our experience with, you know, is not, um, when I pay my loan, bringing on spot demand supply and lithium units globally is challenging. And especially when you think about a combination of, of volume, volume growth, and quality. And each of those are going to be overestimated, in our view, um, in which case markets will continue to be tight for, for quite some time. Um, we've heard many analysts over the years that, that lithium markets will be oversupplied, that there's plenty of lithium in the world but there's not plenty of lithium in the world that fits the right combination of location, quality, and supply, accessibility or infrastructure, um, in the right jurisdictions that don't otherwise suffer from geopolitical challenges. Um, yeah, I mean, it's a complex world of urban industrial minerals supply chain that, that doesn't want to be complex, but that naturally is. Thanks, Ken, one final one as a remainder question that's a good ones to wrap up on. Um, um, this gentleman says, Major car manufacturers will compete numbers for AV production 30 to 2030. Is there enough to achieve those production forecasts? Uh, I don't want to everybody trite but car makers have been asleep at the wheel. Um, they haven't been paying enough attention to the raw material supply in battery raw materials in the last five years. And it's coming back to haunt them because insufficient, um, incentive was placed in the market when it was really required and especially during that period three to five years ago, um, to get to where we need to be today. So, so not enough capital flowing upstream, not enough, uh, definitive off-take agreements that tie up the supply chain. Uh, not enough interconnected agreements that, that motivate the supply chain to, to, to be interconnected. Um, each of those things represents a, a serious challenge to the industry that should have been solved some years ago but now needs to be solved and will take some years to, to get right. Excellent. Thanks, Ken. That's all from crosstalk Okay. Thank you Nick, Rachel, it sounds like we're all done. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
      "withCtc" : "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Pilgrim Minerals December 2021 quarterly investor conference call and webcast. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question via the phones, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Ken Brinsden, Managing Director and CEO. Please Thank you, Rachel, and welcome to everybody joining on the call and welcome to those who are participating via the webcast, especially those uh shareholders that have taken the time to join in is much appreciated. Uh here in the First Filber Mineral set office I'm joined by Dale Henderson, our Chief Operating Officer, and Brian Ryn, uh Chief Financial Officer, uh both of whom you'll hear from during the call. Also in the office here with us, Alex Eastwood, uh Chief Democratical Officer, General Counsel and David Hahn, our investor relations specialist. Thanks to everyone for joining. Well the backdrop to the quarterly call is one of strong demand, accelerating price, and in part Tilbury and Minerals responding, albeit with some production challenges evident and especially during uh the December quarter. Um we've been continuing to work on the acceleration of Kilgangora production and a very very, busy quarter as we started production at the Nugaju plant, that is for just to remind you the former Baltura facilities, and we brought on the Pilganant Pl Improvements Project, which is is complete and now fully tied in and we continue to ramp up the production at the Pilldam plant. In support of all that, a lot more site activity. And that includes relatively significant growth in mining volumes, which you can see in the production tables within the quarterly, albeit still having to go higher as we support production growth both in the short and the medium term. And customers obviously want more product. You can see that with respect to pricing. Pricing's quite incredible and that's something that I'll come back to talk to in in more detail during our commentary. Yeah, incredible results on our BMX platform um with respect to spot sales. Very, very strong pricing, especially in China, which is just reminding everyone is the world's largest lithium raw materials market and that's now spreading to international markets with pricing hitting record highs virtually every week. And that's translating very well to spodjamin, which which is part of what again I'll explain in in more detail um the reference prices at a headline lithium chemicals price and how that's playing to the value in the spogamine. I'm going to explain a bit more detail there to un so that you understand some of the dynamics in the market. The ramp up in production continues, albeit slower than we would like. Just to remind everyone, we're taking Peel Gangora production from approximately three hundred and thirty thousand Bogamine concentrate funds per annum to five hundred and eighty thousand spodjamine concentrate production, big production growth, and with that have come some challenges. But as always the the Pilboro Minerals team is working incredibly hard and carries some fantastic skills that we've learned over the years about how to bring that production on. Still targeting five hundred and eighty thousand uh spodgamine concentrate tons by the run rate by the middle of this year. However, both plants are still in their ramp up phase and it's that issue combined with the effects of difficulties in the labour market and then more recently immunity distribution of of the COVID virus here in Western Australia that means there is some risk to to our ability to produce as l as hard and as fast as we would like. Um but nonetheless, um you know a lot of work going on as I said and the Bilbera Minerals team carries all the right skills to to make it happen and we're obviously doing the best that we can. The POSCO Downstream Joint Venture was executed during the quarter, and we're now going through the completion criteria for the final formation of the joint venture in parallel POSCO themselves have started the early works um at the one young site and they've confirmed that they'll start uh the significant construction works um during the current course. So we're looking forward to their progress over approximately the next two years as we head to Oz Silver and Minerals first hydroxide production in joint venture with COSCO. So coming up, Dale will explain a bit more about what we're up to in both production and if we ramp up the plant and also production growth to the medium term. And Brian will follow up with some more commentary about cash flow generation and a little bit of a follow up to the cost story. So on that note, Dale, over to you. Thanks again and good morning everyone. I'll offer my commentary on on three parts. So firstly a little bit about the operations, a quick touch on on the reserve update that we did during the quarter and then to finish I'll provide some insight into the projects uh space and expansion plans which we've got coming up. So status uh operations it can described, uh it's been a growth quarter, uh, bringing on two operations, ramping them, starting to ramp those up both simultaneously. Uh so growth quarter, but we've definitely had some growing pains, and Ken mentioned the labour shortages are which are happening uh across the state. Uh Pilbara has not been immune to that and we have found uh some of those pains uh end to end through our operation. That being said, uh the cord has still had fairly solid production um at 84,000 tons at the low end of our guidance. Recovery, 62% average across both operations yet again slightly below where we wanted it to be. Now stepping through um the sub-set operation, from a mining perspective it was a quarter of of moving more waste as further plan, but not quite the volumes we wanted to achieve. Again, a function of of some of the labour shortages uh that uh our mining contractor is seeing. One of the consequences of this was was slightly compromised ore uh in in terms of feed ore to the plant, which translated through to slightly lower recovery than we had planned. So consequence there around mining movements. As part of the the response to mining, during the quarter Pilbara instigated our own mine fleet and and mobilized our own small owner operate fleet uh to support the Southbit operation which principally serves the Nugajoo plant. So if we kick that off during the quarter and please report that that start as well. So moving from mining and stepping into each of the processing plants. So with Tilgan processing for the quarter average of 65% recovery versus the plant of 35%, as I mentioned earlier, slightly off where we wanted where we wanted it to be. Uh the improvement projects package, which is the debottlenecking project for that plant, with construction complete, commissioned and we're really just moving through it an optimization phase as we as we look to ramp up and increase throughput through through that uh operation. From a cost basis uh higher than we wanted where we wanted to be, uh a consequence of of increased mine movements, uh some mine contract performance challenges that I mentioned and in the plant space uh the oil feed being slightly off where we want it and some delays around commissioning for for both plants, including some extended shutdowns. So um in in summary, quite a few contributing factors playing through through your cost impact. And Brian will speak to this in a little bit more uh detail uh later uh in his section. So moving from toolgand processing plants and now speaking to Nugajo, uh the the super cord was the cord where where you hit the ignition switch, uh so to speak, uh first concentrate from the core circuit coming through um an early October and that operation we're moving it through a stage ramp up with with core circuit first float uh to follow. Float circuit, we're on track to to effectively start that ignition switch of the circuit uh in this quarter. So ramp up uh slower than what what we wanted where we wanted it to be, uh some maintenance issues contributing there. But all said and done, good to get the wheels turning and production stone to flow from the operation. Last thing on the OLTS update, production guidance. You'll know from uh our update that given the labour challenges and some of the ramp up challenges we've had, uh we're we're commencing a review and we'll look to revise our guidance upon the our half yearly results uh when they come out in due course. And that completes the ops update. Um moving to part two on the reserve, uh just a a note there that during the quarter uh we did do a uh uh a significant reserve upgrade. So this was the combination of of bringing in the Altura uh reserve and resource and into the existing silver minerals one. So a big increase, forty seven percent um upgrade from the prior year to one hundred sixty two million tons. So huge reserve upgrade, which of course supports uh the ramp up we're doing and the progressive expansion plan. So, lastly the expansion plans, where are we at? So historically we've talked about expansion in terms of stage two and and incremental stages of stage two. We've uh dropped that uh naming convention and and chose to revert to more simplified uh labeling for everyone's benefit. Uh the P six eighty project, as it's now called, is the next incremental expansion beyond the ramp up that we're in the thick of at the moment. So this is to provide a hundred thousand uh tons additional to our total production capacity, bringing us up to six hundred and eighty thousand tons per annum. Where are we at with this project? Uh we're in the closing stages of study work and and targeting an FID uh in the June quarter, all going well. Beyond that, it's the P one thousand expansion project, which is as the name suggests stepping up to a hundred one thousand uh kilotons per annum in in aggregate production from from the operation and we're targeting FID uh for that expansion in the December quarter this year. And lastly, in the project space, the the midstream project, which to remind everyone, is the production of the value added high purity lithium chemical salts. The scoping study is is in a finalisation stage at the moment. We're also completing the economic evaluation for that and looking to announce that in the coming weeks. Beyond that uh scoping set announcement, we we uh positively disposed of moving forward that project uh with our partners Calix, uh ultimately to to commercialise um that that project and that approach and and bring what we think is a superior product to market. So what's the space and we look forward to updating on on that accordingly. So that's a wrap of Ops Reserve and Projects. And at this point I'll hand over to Brian. Well thanks thanks very much Dale and and good morning or good afternoon everyone. Um if I think about the uh the the financial impact of the the the quarter that we just had, I I sort of put it in in sort of three three three different aspects. One is obviously a very, very positive price environment, very strong operating margins generated, but with some of the operating challenges that Dale has just gone through, we've we've obviously had some impact in terms of higher unit operating costs. In terms of the the physicals, uh we produced just over eighty three thousand tonnes of sphogyine concentrates uh and solved about seventy five thousand tons of concentrate that was produced on the bilgam plant and about 3,600 tons of concentrate that was produced from the Magaju plants. So that some exputes an increase in inventory of about 5,000 tons and we we closed the quarter with closing stocks of about 16,000 tonnes, which which represents about um half a month's worth of production. In terms of price and operating margin, now I think everyone's aware it's been quite an extraordinary improvement in pricing over the last quarter. And we averaged uh a price of somewhere between US one seven five oh and US one thousand eight hundred dollars a ton on an SC six basis. And just as a reminder that, compares to a pricing of eight fifty to nine hundred dollars a time that we uh we achieved for September. So that's that's quite an extraordinary uplift in pricing. So with that uh with that pricing environments clearly um we generated a a much stronger operating margin. So our our our margin uh was about US one one five oh uh per diometric ton for each for the tonne sold from Pilgon to seventy five thousand tons from Pilgon. So with that strong operating margin, uh there's been a significant increase in the company's tax position. Um so the September cash position was about a hundred and thirty seven million dollars and that obviously we bought require cash, we quote cash plus uh the uh the L Cs as well for for shipments that occurred in the quarter. So September we had one hundred and thirty seven million dollars and at the end of December we now find ourselves at two hundred and forty five million dollars. So that's that's an increase of uh of uh just under one hundred and eight million dollars. Um so where where has that uh that increase come from? So with the cash operating margin that uh the Tilgham fund was able to generate represents about a hundred just under one hundred and sixteen million dollars for the quarter. We also uh through the tons that we sold at at Nagaj, even though you know Nagaju is still in ramp up and and commissioning phase, um, we actually still generate a deposit cash flow of about two two million dollars uh following the sale of the 3,600 tonnes from that statutory operation. Capital standard cost of business was about twenty, just under $27 million, and that's obviously money spent on the Pilgamp Plan improvements on the restart of the magnitude operation the commission and also on the the official waste mining that's currently uh being undertaken. Um but that was largely offset by the drawdown of of debt. So during the quarter we took the opportunity to increase our debt facility with with our banks by US twenty million dollars. Uh that was done deliberately to help us fund the the restart of the nuggets operation. So that that US twenty million dollar agreement was signed, signed up during the quarter and the monies were torn down in December. And that was uh represents about twenty twenty seven million Australian dollars. We also paid about two million dollars in um in interest cost on the debt and we also paid a cash sweep under these the debt facilities of about two two US million dollars as well. So at the end of the quarter, we end up with about two hundred forty five million dollars of cash, and that represents a a a net cash position, so net of debt of around about sixty eight million dollars. So clearly this quarter um has been a significant uh significant for the company and and places the company in a much, much stronger financial position uh than than we were uh at the start of the quarter. The the obvious the the the one downside if you like for from the quarter uh from a from a financial point of view is is is the unit operating cost. So the unit operating cost clearly has been impacted by the the challenging operating environment that we've that we faced during the quarter um and was US five hundred and eighty seven a tonne, um which is which was about at US one hundred forty two a ton higher than the unit operating cost for the September quarter. So that increase of of one hundred and forty two dollars, about fifty six US fifty six of that really relates to to royalty. So obviously if the uh selling price environment is is is going up, um we are paying a much higher royalty. So about fifty six dollars of that increase related solely through the fact that we are having to pay higher royalties as a result of receiving a high selling price. The remaining $86 is really attributable to the fact that we generated lower levels of spygeny concentrate production. And this sale alluded to really was as a result of plant shutdown to facilitate the time of the um of the plant improvement project up till now. Uh we have some unplanned downtime events to address um some maintenance and equipment issues that needed to be rectified. We also ended up with a with a lower recovery as as Val mentioned. This is right really due to the fact that the the the all fee of being presented to the pub wasn't wasn't as as optimal as it as as it should be. And then we were also impacted by the fact that there's just a lack of of mining production and maintenance personnel in in the market which which which impacts uh how the operation um gets Now, if I think about those cost increases, they are I think unique to the challenges that we're currently facing. I don't think they are necessarily something which is going to be a permanent increase and other than the the the higher already costs which are linked to the the selling cost, my expectation is as we as we achieve st to state production from the operations at those costs will come back to to the levels that we had guided to previously. However, as Dale mentioned before, we are currently undertaking a review of of our production and and and we whether need to provide our production guidance and if there is any impact of that production guidance on unit costs including we will we will make be making that disclosure at the same time in uh in late February when we when we uh release uh half your accounts. So I think that's uh that's everything I I wanted to go through. So Ken I might might hand back to you. Yes, thank you Brian. Thank you Dale. Um a bit more commentary about the market and in particular uh apologies in advance for delving into a little bit of detail about the pricing environment but I think it's particularly important to to explain how that works so that you have a greater understanding of the opportunities that the current market represents. Um obviously given where prices got to, there is a a growing disconnect between available supply and surging demand. Surging demand is driven by all those things that that represent opportunity in electrifying the global economy, but lithium ion batteries are now key to that, so hence the the growth in demand. On the supplier side, um without wanting to put words in other producers' mouths, I don't think their experience is necessarily any different to silver or minerals. It is tough to bring on additional capacity in an environment where you were previously being punished. Very low pricing environment had meant that that every producer had slowed down. Um so I think it's highly likely um that that on the supply side there will be challenges and it's probably the case that that the supply response is already being overstated. So it's against that that challenging environment that the price is is surging and um and it's and it's kind of perverse. But for the very same reason that silver and minerals had a challenging production quarter, you are likely to see a pricing increase because the supply response is insufficient. I hope that makes sense. On pricing itself, and delving into a little bit of the detail, PLAPS reported China domestic pricing in battery grade lithium carbonate of three hundred and eighty six thousand yuan per metric ton lithium carbonate equivalent basis. So that's over USD sixty thousand US dollars a ton in China. Now people will tend to want to dismiss that price because uh it it's I think somewhat unfairly described as a spot price. But what's actually being discovered in that price survey is the real price being paid by the same relationship, i.e. a long term seller and a long term buyer who are constantly renegotiating the price and volume. So what it is, well I think what it represents is the real price that the chemical conversion industry received in China. R you know, bearing in mind that China is the world's largest lithium raw materials market. And I think all the evidence points for that price being a real price because it's also driving international pricing, which typically has longer dated contracts. But international pricing um is already approaching fifty thousand US dollars a ton. So so for those that want to characterize it as a spot price, I think that's a little bit of a misrepresentation. It is the price that the chemical conversion industry receives. Well why is that important? This is where the the forgiveness supply base um ultimately have its stay in the fund. And I think Bilbera Minerals is particularly well placed to participate in that pricing environment. What it means is that if if a chemical converter is receiving $60,000 or over sixty thousand US dollars per ton for their for their battery grade carbonate. If you deduct the VAT and you deduct the cost of chemical conversion, they have approximately fifty thousand dollars left to spend on their raw materials. Fifty thousand dollars left to spend on their raw materials, of which spogamine is obviously a key component. What that means is that the chemical conversion industry can pay a lot more for spogamine, and in my view, they likely will, because there is no alternative. They already have chemical conversion capacity, of which there is oodles in China, but there is insufficient spodjamin to backfill the chemical conversion capacity. The net effect of all that is that they will pass their margin upstream, which means poljamene pricing is already very strong, but in my view, likely to get stronger. And I know everyone thinks that sounds like a pretty extraordinary scenario. But have a think about this. It's not iron ore. Phogamine is not iron ore. Spogamine and its derivative chemicals are part of an industrial mineral supply chain turning into a specialty chemical supply chain for which most players will already be contractually bound. They are contractually bound to sell chemicals to a cathode materials player or or a cellmaker, maybe in China, but equally probably Japan and Korea. They are contractually bound, but they don't have the raw material. And what that means is that they will pay virtually anything for the raw material. So the dynamic in you know that I'm describing is one that's very different to what most people might be used to in natural resources markets because you know if you took iron ore as an example, that's a very large liquid pool of available products. That's not what's what's represented by an industrial mineral supply chain where people are uh uh have built purpose built you know purpose built chemical facilities to match a combination of input raw material feed for a defined quality for a customer is probably a longer data customer downstream. So so all those dynamics create something that's very unusual in the pricing world when there's such a bad disconnect between available supply and surging demand. So so that's what's going on in forgy main markets, quite incredible. I think Silber and Minerals is really well placed. We're probably outperformed as it relates to price received in the December quarter. And the March quarter is already looking very, very strong. So we've guided for between two thousand six hundred and three thousand US dollars per ton CIF China on a six percent spodjamene basis because we see lithium chemicals pricing being very strong which represents a a key a key peg to our phogyamine price. So so yeah, incredible signs, um but nonetheless silver and minerals will be having its day in the sun. So that's the detail in the the Spogamine market. Um the other means by which we look to take advantage of that is through the the BMX platform. The BMX platform um will typically handle uh excess product from our Pilgangora production, uh most of which is coming through the growth in Nobajo production, which is coming. Um we've only been producing through the HMS circuit so far. We're continuing to trip away that and the flotation circuit with the expectation that the flotation circuit starts during the latter part of the current quarter. In which case we should have more product available for the BMX platform and we're looking forward to the price discovery that that flushes out. So, to close, uh in summary, um it's a challenge bringing on the two plants and the expanded capacity that they represent, especially in light of the the tight labour market um that WA currently suffers from. We're all looking forward to the borders opening because it's ultimately it should provide some relief through those tight labour market conditions. Um Firstly, whilst that was a challenging quarter, it's not just filter and minerals experience. We expect that just about every resources company is going through similar issues, including the other lithium raw material providers. What does that point to? Well it points to at least in part constrained supply, which points to probably higher price. We think we are really well placed to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. Um, I'm confident in the team and their ability to to bring on the remaining capacity, um, in which case we will have a very, very good year. Rachel, I'm going to throw back to you. I'm sure there'll be plenty of interesting questions on the phone call, but equally some that'll come out of our webcast. So yeah, look forward to people's questions. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. If you wish to ask the question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star to. If you are on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Your first question comes to Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hello, Ken and Team. Uh just a couple from me. Um perhaps just starting with the recovery um across Kilgangura. Just wondering with uh Nugged you., Um when do you think uh what's kind of the expected maximum recovery you'll you think you'll be able to get there once you bring the floats online and what sort of time and business we might be able to um see that across? Yeah, Al, yep, so in the detail there, um Bill Game was compromised by the new equipment being brought on as part of the improvements project and the effect of a less than optimal blend. So that we experience recovery in a pill gun of sort of 65% versus 75%. And maybe The the recovery is materially lower while we're using just the HMS circuit with the transitional law. So nominally 30% recovery until we bring on the flow station circuit. Target recovery, so Nobby overtime with a fully optimised circuit is likely in the order of high sixties, seventy percent as compared to Phil GAN being seventy five percent for argument. So Yeah that's that's really helpful. Thanks again. Um just secondly, just on the FIDs for P six eighty and P one thousand, just I'm wondering how long after FID, if if they are successful, could works begin, just given the tight labour market you're seeing and just any commentary you have on the he perhaps percentage increases in Capex you've you've been seeing relative to prior studies? Yeah, I'll I'll try it now for Yeah, sure. I'll um add to the timing around uh starting execution of those projects post FID. Uh the good news is for the P six A it could be could be fairly quick. Um it's um that project is effectively an expansion to the HMS circuit. Um so the function of engineering and timing long leaves within construction could could be as soon excuse me as soon as six months starting as soon as six months post S ID. But we wouldn't expect um likely the the ramp up of that for maybe nine to twelve months post-FID. That's largely driven by our estimates around long leaves. As to capital increase and cost increases, we've definitely observed uh escalation uh uh across the board within the WA environment, steel prices and the like. Uh we haven't translated that through quite yet to to the to the CapEx forecast uh for these particular projects, but of course we will we will do that as part of the FID decision. Hope that answers your question. Yeah thanks Del and just maybe with the P one thousand, is is do you think that will have a a longer um e uh build time frame after FID, just giving us a bit bigger? The The w one of the questions we haven't resolved yet is is actually the staging of of that particular pilot expansion is potential that we might choose to forward order long leaves and the long leaves uh for for both those two expansions really drives the critical path not so much uh um and how do you uh uh uh labor um uh constraints as more long leaves and And uh as it relates to the um P one thousand, uh the good news there is uh we already have uh the H B D R for that circuit. Um so for us it would be really around looking at bore mill timing and and the float cells principally all the other things with uh a large man. So um we could be uh well placed potentially to move fairly quickly with that. Great, thanks thanks Dale. If I can just sneak one last one in. Just wondering if you guys have a rough um split of of um Pilbri's product it goes into hydroxide versus carbonate converters and and whether or not that's changed substantially since we've seen these bigger bigger increases in carbonate price inverse the hydroxide price. Yeah, our customers, uh the contracted customers do a mix of both, so it's very difficult to determine exactly how much goes into the carbonate chemical sweet versus hydroxide. But to be honest, in today's environment you could you could be amb ambivalent about it because any any um primary hydroxide producer, i.e. straight from Bodjamin to hydroxide, is probably twisting hydroxide to carbonate, a very low cost process of carbonation to take advantage of bowls for carbonate price. So and actually in the scheme of things they're doing that for roughly the same cost as the cost of chemical conversions carbonate anyway, um because the primary hydroxide route would typically be a bit cheaper. Um so from our point of view we're we're not overly fussed kind of one way or the other, we're ultimately being consumed. But given the price differential between carbon and hydroxide that's that's very much a likely market response twisting our drop size card in it. Great. Thanks Ken. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Ryan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. anything up there if you can have that refinery uh I mean some of you can the aspect products I know look for you could be an S platform as well. I was just wondering if that would be a material um earnings earlier if that would be a material for earnings. Yeah, good question, Mitch. And it's hard to disagree with the logic that says the more volume and the more price points that are established on such a platform, um the better the combination of price transparency and market development for more sophisticated market tools to emerge. So broadly speaking, we're supportive of of an objective that creates more product pricing on things like the B and X platform. Um so we're very open to those discussions and it won't surprise you that that those discussions, you know, are already underway. Seems like a very, very logical model to deploy and an e the industry is absolutely crying out for for stronger price of transp price transparency. So so in light of that I guess the the you wouldn't necessarily looking for for a commercial benef a a a m material commercial benefit, it would be more about the improved transparency of the market would benefit all players involved, I guess. That's right, rising tide f,loats or boats. So so yes, pretty much that that logic and and ultimately it's going to be good for the market as a whole to get more sophisticated sort of pricing methodology out there. Uh we're not interested so much in the commercial potential in in that model, just broad participation across all products and and in fact silver and minerals itself is also keen to put more price points on the platform, i.e. you know varying squadjamin grades and over time, midstream products and and who knows, uh maybe our own lithium chemicals over time. Yes, but thank second more question. for you Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Gabb from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Thanks, uh and hi Kennethine. Um just a couple of questions from me. I guess firstly just on the the labour challenges and particularly with respect to um some of the stripping, I guess this year was gonna be a bit of a catch up year for the stripping rate. I'm just curious, is this gonna pose a a challenge at some point? Is it gonna create a bottleneck for you as you look to expand, or are you we've got quite a lot of um headway on that? And I'll just follow up with one more question. Thanks. Yeah, Jack, uh a couple of introductory comments on that subject and I'll hand to Dale. Um yeah, you're right, the the this year is all about catch up and we had about sort of fifteen to eighteen months worth of of um higher than life of mine strip to catch up. Uh that's necessitated mobilising more fleets and larger fleets. It's been constrained by Labour so so that's part of the challenge. So is there anything else you wanna you wanna add? Um the only thing I would add is with the acquisition of Eltura presents more opportunities in terms of access to all. So um without question there's a heap of material to move waste movements but uh we do have multiple areas to draw from um so that puts us in in fairly good stead as we as we think about our theories, mine plans, etcetera. That's all I'd add. Perfect, thanks. And then just one on pricing. Can you give us a sense of the the range I guess of your pricing that you actually receive across your contract, ignoring BMX for a second, um, within your guidance. And then secondly within that guidance as well, are you including any material volumes from the BMX platform at this point? For Q one? Thanks. three thousand US dollars a ton represents an estimate of contracted pricing based on what we see today. Um so it's only only contracted pricing excludes whatever might yet occur on the BMX platform. And I might just add up that there's probably a risk to further upside as a function of of if the speed with which chemicals have accelerated. Um oh uh yeah sorry the first question. Um actually it's relatively tight um contract pricing across the customer group. There's really no material difference emerging um in respect of the various pricing models. They've they've pretty much approximated each other within a couple of hundred dollars, you know, of of of each individual contract. Um and they do vary over time because they do use slightly different sort of pricing modeling but it's in the detail. They all reference uh lithium or typically all reference lithium chemical, potentially in a slightly different way, but the net outcome of the pricing is pretty tight. That's really helpful. Thanks so much, I'll um Libida. Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Kerr from the Australian Financial Review. Please go ahead. Um just wondering on the border. I assume you're not going to join the exodus of uh all the other W A based CEOs who are coming next. Um and secondly, with the February five delay, did that upend any plans you had in terms of, you know, did you have uh particular markets on the east coast you were targeting as of Fed six? And um yeah, how do you sort of cope now with that with that sort of indefinite uncertainty? Yeah, good question, Peter. Um I can assure you there was lots of kids in the Brisbane household um with the border. and and uh the desire to catch up with them. Um with respect to work, uh no not my intention to merge to Melbourne or or Sydney, uh not any time soon. And and did it disrupt plans? Well, the the i it's an indirect impact of the border that it constrains short term labor supply. So so that actually gets to the heart of a lot of the issues that we've been dealing with and especially while we're ramping up the two plants, when something breaks or when we've got to do a a shutdown, you typically can't get the labor, at least not in the way we used to, to create the peak load that's required to get the jobs done quickly. So a shutdown that should have taken um thirty six hours takes you know takes seventy two and a and a you know broken ball mill coupling takes takes sort of fifty six hours to to fix when it should have taken twenty four, you know, that type of thing. Um that that's really one of the key issues. And then our contractors, uh the mining contractors feel it as well. Um they typically have a slightly higher sort of transitory workforce and they're highly mobile. And what's happening now with everyone fishing from the same pool in that that contracted space, um and it it's leading to to lots of some uh you know, some challenges accessing labor and hanging on to labor for our contractors. So so yeah, if the borders being continuing to close creates challenges in that keep personnel and and the extent to which which our contractors can retain their personnel. So yeah, it's a big issue. Uh the sooner the borders open and we get the the you know, the the the the mobility back in the workforce is really the key. And so presumably you think the negative impact of those labour challenges is greater than the COVID impact will be when it starts spreading through your workforce, you know, as it as it is over here? Definitely some risk to to the production environment for WA mining companies. No two ways about it, but it should be relatively transitory. I measured in months, you know, a couple of months, not not six to twelve months. Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Baker from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. G'day Canon Team. Um yeah, just a question on the the mine grades. Um they've been above reserve grade at uh one point one eight percent for uh for quite some time. Uh just wondering uh, you know, what your mind plan is saying about uh you know coming back to meet reserve grade, you know, how far off are we from that? Yeah, good question. Um we've been reasonably clear historically that that Tilgan or that the original Tilgan Gore operation was always mining a slightly higher grade in its first four years, roughly, um of production. That's just a function of the way the ore presents at Bill Gangora. So um so nothing particularly sort of tricky there. But the lower reserve grade also r has resulted from the the addition of the South Pit, i.e. the former Al Jura operations, which again was always a lower reserve grade than the original Pilgangora reserve grade. Um so that also explains some of the gap. Um yeah, so uh we've been in production now for two or three years, so we've got another year or two worth of slightly elevated grades and um and then and then they'll start to revert more to the to the reserve norm. Sure, thanks that one. Um yeah, you mentioned that uh you know, there's gonna be the substantial reviews guidance uh with a half year result in every um I'm guessing there'll be some impact to the second half financial year twenty two guidance, but just wondering how likely it is to steam past the target of uh five forty to five eighty thousand tons of squad trumps by uh mid year. Yeah, more discussions come given that we've got about another four weeks prior to the half year results, there's several things going through our mind there and the next three or four weeks will probably be formative. Um the first is the effect of continued plant ramp up. There's a big gap between the historical production at 330,000 spoty main concentrate tons per annum compared to where we're going, 580,000housand squad genome concentrate funds per annum. And our guidance is tensive to the speed with which we can bring on that capacity. So we really need another three or four weeks to see how we go with the plants um and and the the you know the work that's already happened and integrating the the accommodation of new equipment, especially Navajo, um where we're bringing on the flotation circuit. Um, so that's part one. Um, as to absolute production capacity, i.e., five hundred and eighty thousand tons, well, you know, we're still confident about hitting that run rate in the middle of the year as a function of both plants and and their performance. So the bit that we're sensitive to is the remaining ramp up. Lastly, it's worthwhile mentioning the borders and COVID. You know, there's obvious community transmission going on here. Now mining companies are going to start feeling that. Um so we are a bit sensitive to to what that impact might be. Now indirectly it's already hurt us because we we struggled to get people peak as I described. Um but it's possible there's also production impact from the community transmission and how that relates to our available workforce. So give us another three or four weeks, ma',am and we'll have that largely cleared cleared up and um we'll provide more definitive guidance. Thank you. There are no further telephone questions at this time. I'll now hand over to Nicholas Reed for any webcast questions. Thanks, Rachel. We have a number of uh questions that have been logged online to the scene here. Um firstly uh some questions from John Beckworth. He says could you please expand on the company's uh strategy and the initiatives that have been put in place to deal with the current skills and labour challenges and risks in WA? Yeah, good question, John. And yes, of course there has already been actually significant response. So the first thing is to have taken on um some of the the challenge ourselves. Um Philbury Minerals has commenced its own mining fleet and the logic in doing that uh it's multifaceted, but one of the key drivers is the relative accessibility of longer term employees by filter and minerals as compared to our contractors. And it's all to do with the way the workforce works here in WA, most employees not all but most employees would say longer term employment with an established company is a safer bet and I think we also trade on the benefit of being involved in the new economy in mining, um battery raw materials which is seen as the future and and hence that that brand has a better um attraction and retention status. So so that's the key thing that we've taken on ourselves and um so far so good. We haven't had too many dramas accessing people um ourselves, but certainly our contractors have. Um there has also been um work done with respect to retention. So for example the way we pay our people, the the the bonuses, the net benefits, we've done work on our camp, you know, there's lots of things that have happened um that that should have the desired effect of both attracting and retaining people over time. With respect to our contractors, well we've done a bit more sort of innovative thinking with them. Again rosters, um you know the camp and and in certain circumstances the way they're incentivized, um, with a view to helping attract and retain people. The one key challenge which we still haven't really broken the back of is the peak labour that I described when you when you need th you know large numbers of personnel for shutdowns and or breakdowns. That is an area that's still of concern and uh and again not a challenge that we're dealing with on our own. It's a a broad a very broad issue for for the mining companies here in WA generally. I hope that makes sense, John. Thanks, Ken. Two to others from John he he asked um the fallback of the share price over the last week or so, uh how much of that would be attributed to the Broadroad Global Market correction and how much to investor concern about the risks and challenges that have been discussed today? And secondly, can you update us on how the company's thinking about dividend policy given the strong performance of financially in that recent times? Um well w with respect to um Dilbert's Fair Price, I I think it's largely traded in line with its fears. Um I don't think there's anything particularly special that's that's gone on there that relates to Pilbera minerals specifically. Um it wouldn't be unusual to have a pullback uh when well, when lithium stocks had run as hard as they had, um, but also taking into account broader sentiment issues in global markets. Um uh the spectre of inflation uh you know clearly led to a bit of a risk golf attitude and I I would attribute most of the share price movements, you know, to that to that effect. Um second question dividends. Oh dividends, dividends. Um yeah, well, um as described by Dale, uh we have a lot of um growth ahead of us, uh, which we think represents a you know a reasonable reinvestment in our business. Um that's important. Uh and ultimately depends on what the price does, but but price versus you know, cost will be one of our assessments as to whether dividends ultimately become part of the story for the medium term. So so more to be discovered in that regard, John, before we can be definitive about dividend streams. Thanks, Ken. Uh question from Rob Clark. He says with respect to your impressive balance sheet strengthening, does your midstream project warrant more resources and can you look at ways to increase the speed to market of this product? Also, can you please clarify if the product is being targeted directly? Oh, okay. Yeah, both both good questions. Um well we very much like the the midstream product and and Dale said, um I think your words are something like a a very competitive product or a compelling product for the market, something like that, huh? I can't remember. Anyway, I agree wholeheartedly, it is a compelling product for the market and recutting the spotch and supply train is going to be a a big part of the future of our industry um because there are more efficient solutions. So um we're working about as hard and as fast as we can on that project. Um really happy to be working with Calyx and their smart team. Um but it's still got engineering development to to to be undertaken and it's very difficult to to short circuit that. Um so more work to be done and probably more to be said about that as we look to publish the first round of engineering uh in the coming weeks? Um I think that's pretty much it. Yep, yep. Great. Uh next question is from Aiden Bearso Macquarie. It says, uh is the long term production target closely expansion still approximately one million tons per annum or have you made some changes to long term recovery assumptions? And secondly, what percentage of sales in twenty twenty two are likely to be on the BNX platform. Okay. Yep. Um Yeah, so long term production, Hayden, is still targeting beyond one million tons per annum of spot humane concentrate. And broadly speaking, you know, that should happen in the period sort of two thousand and the latter part of two thousand and twenty three, early part of two thousand and twenty four onwards. Now more work to be done from an engineering and a delivery point of view, but we have no doubt that Pilobangora as a production centre has that capacity and it will be a very important part of global supply. So yeah, very much still in the picture. With respect to recovery, it's actually no, nothing's changed. With respect to our views around recovery, consistent with previous commentary, slightly lower recoveries at Nobus U, just as a function of the way that plant works in comparison to to Pilgans. Um and and and a slightly lower head grade overall likely to be fed to nobody over time. Um but recovery is still the same and uh and the photation is still a very important part of the future at Pilgangora, um, whether at Pilgan or at Magadu. Um okay, so if I still intervention some sorry, sales for the VMS platform. Yeah. Um well there's still some uncertainty, so uh that's a function of how quickly we can bring on the remaining capacity at merger from a production point of view, it's still a relatively early phase because we're only relying on on HMS in the transitional ore. Um the flotation circuit uh construction is well advanced. Um we're into the the cells now and and still expecting that those um cells will be fired up from a construction point of view we're finishing off the the last of the construction in the cell to align it with our flotation technique. Um and a view that they'll be commissioned from later in the March quarter. So then the question is how quickly we can bring that on to bring on additional capacity because it's that capacity and and whatever we can stretch kill gain two that becomes excess capacity to go to the BMX platform. Um so it's difficult to be definitive, to be honest, Hayden, about what ultimately gets sold on spot uh this area. Once the plant is at full capacity, so five hundred and eighty thousand tons, then approximately two hundred thousand tons of that is available, you know, it's at our disposal to sell as we choose. And and at the moment we would choose to sell by far the majority of that to the VMX platform because pricing is going to be very strong. Chemical conversion industry is going to give away their margin to secure spodjamine supply, in which case spodjamine supply, you know, or pricing, um will surprise to the upright. Thanks, Ken. There are a couple of other BMX questions, so I'll just group them together and apologies if we're going over the the same ground here, but one was to confirm are you expecting a BMX uh option this quarter? Yes, that's that's uh yep. And the second one, if all goes well with the MobyGo plants, can you give some sort of estimate of how many BMX sales and salages in total would be expecting for this calendar year. comes on. Um, I can be more definitive about it once the capacity's been built out because then you would have approximately an option every every three weeks roughly, um, as represented by the the total excess capacity that makes its way to the stock market. Great. Thanks, Ken. Uh a question here from Mr. Mills. He says as the company moves relatively quickly to P six eighty and P one thousand, what concerns should there be or are there with with uh shipping movements to markets given global shipping challenges and increased costs? Oh yeah. Um well our experience is that we're we d we don't have difficulty accessing vessels. There's enough trade um and vessels available in our sector. Um Um that that we don't in particular have difficulty accessing the vessels themselves. It's just the cost of attracting the vessels that that's the issue. Um there has been some relief, uh a little bit of relief in this quarter with respect to shipping cost. Um we packed in shipping costs at about seventy to eighty US dollars a tonne. Um average shipping costs prior and from memory were about fifty five or something is that so it's come off um slightly which which is indicative of of more vessels being available. But again make the point. It's not so much that you can't get a vessel, it's just the cost of of the vessel itself. Thanks, Ken. Just a couple of market related questions to wrap up. First one from Mr. Zing. He he asked if he can offer some commentary on uh on the impact on the Lithian market of uh some recent developments we've seen, for instance the Rio Cinto project in Serbia and also some of the political changes in Chile and any potential ramifications of those developments for lithium supply. Yeah, um well the first thing that comes to mind and no disrespect to the analyst community, but it's easy to put supply numbers in a spreadsheet. It's not so easy to to deliver them on the ground. Um by the time you're doing that a lot more complexities come into play. Um you've heard from from Silver about difficulties in bringing in additional capacity. Well our experience with you know is not um we're not on our patent alone. Bringing on spot immune supply and lithium units globally is challenging. And especially when you think about the combination of of volume, volume growth and quality. And each of those are going to be overestimated in our view, um in which case markets will continue to be tight for for quite some time. We've heard many analysts say over the years that that the lithium markets will be oversupplied, that there's plenty of lithium in the world, but there's not plenty of lithium in the world that fits the right combination of location, quality of supply, accessibility to infrastructure, um, in the right jurisdictions that don't otherwise suffer from geopolitical challenges. Um yeah, I mean it's a complex world of of an industrial mineral supply chain that that doesn't want to be complex but but naturally is. Thanks, Ken. One final one. It's a related question, but a good one to wrap up on. Um this gentleman says major car manufacturers are talking big numbers for EV production through to twenty thirty. Is there enough lithium to achieve those production call patterns? Uh don't want to be trite, but car makers have been asleep at the wheel. Um they haven't been paying enough attention to the raw materials supply though in battery raw materials in the last five years. And it's coming back to hoard them because insufficient um incentive was placed in the market when it was really required and especially sort of in that period three to five years ago um to get to where we need to be today. So so not enough capital flowing upstream, not enough uh definitive off take agreements that tie up the supply chain, uh not enough interconnected agreements that that motivate the supply chain to to to be interconnected. Each of those things represents a a serious challenge for the industry that should have been solved some years ago but now needs to be solved and will take some years to to get right. Excellent. Thanks Ken. That's all from the I think I'm going to be able to thank you, Nick Rachel. It sounds like we're all done. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

      "baseline" : "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ESG Flight Plan Event in Emperor's second quarter twenty twenty one financial results. Thank you for standing by. I'm Felipe Calçada and I'll be your host for today. At this time, all participants will watch our financial results presentation. Right after we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions to participate will be given at that time. If you should require any assistance during the event, you can do so using the chat box on the platform. As a reminder, this presentation is being recorded and webcasted at Reuters Platform. Before we begin, just a legal statement. This conference call includes forward looking statements or statements about events or circumstances which have not occurred. Embraer has based these forward looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the business and its future financial performance. These forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among other things, general economic, political and business conditions in Brazil and in other markets where the company is present. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking events and circumstances discussed on this conference call might not occur. And the company's actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements. Participants on today's conference are Francisco Gomes Neto, President and CEO, Antonio Carlos Garcia, Chief Financial Officer and Procurement, and Eduardo Couto, Director of Investor Relations. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Francisco Gomez Neto. Please go ahead, Francisco. Thank you, Philippe. Good morning to all and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that all of you are well and safe, and thank you for your interest in our company. As you will see in Antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were strong. The Q two results are a clear example that our strategic planning has been well executed, with the right focus and discipline, showing significant improvement in our financial performance. Before we go into more details regarding the Q two results, I'd like to highlight the good momentum we are going in the different business segments. In commercial aviation, we announced a new firm order for third E one ninety five E two jets from the Canadian Porter Airlines, with purchase rights for fifty more aircraft. We also announced new firm orders for thirty four E one hundred seventy five jets to Horizon Air and Sky West, to be operated for Alaska Airlines and Delta Airlines. These new orders and other active campaigns reiterate the continuous interest in the e Jet family as the best option in the regional aviation market. In executive aviation, we keep up the momentum with record sales in the quarter. We maintained our price discipline strategy and had a strong backlog growth with book to bill in excess of two to one for this business. In defence and security, we delivered seven super Tucano aircraft in the first half of the year. Also, we had strong performance in our cybersecurity and systems integration companies, with double digit revenue growth in the first half of this year, compared to the first half of last year. Further, in the second quarter, the KC three hundred ninety Millennium reached an important milestone by successfully performing unpaved runaway tests. Although we are currently in negotiations with the Brazilian Air Force on the K C twenty nineteen millennium contract, we continue to be focused on the new export sales campaigns for this aircraft as well as the Supertocano. In services and support, we are pleased with strong second quarter results, with better revenues and higher margins, as traffic recovery and strong maintenance activity drove fifty five percent revenue growth in the second quarter. It is exciting to see the continued positive sales activity in services, with deals signed with several important customers across all markets and at OGMA, driving backlog expansion for this segment during the period. This was further highlighted by the contract we signed with Porter Airlines for a twenty year total support programme. With respect to innovation, we continue to make progress on partnerships in the urban air mobility ecosystem through our subsidiary IV in a segment with strong growth potential in the years to come. In addition, our services collaborative platform Beacon signed agreements with key customers such as Republic for its maintenance applications. Finally, on the operations front, we continue to see great improvements. We expect a sixteen percent increase in inventory turns compared to twenty twenty and a twenty percent reduction in production cycle time of our aircraft this year, positively impacting working capital and production costs. I will now hand it over to Antonio Garcia, our CFO, to give further details on the financial results and I will return in the end. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco, and good morning everyone. I will start with our backlog for the quarter. On slide seven, the graph shows we ended the second quarter at fifty nine billion, up one point seven billion or twelve percent from the prior quarter. This represent a return to the same fifteen point nine billion we were at in twenty twenty, before the pandemic began. In our commercial aviation business, we closed forty eight aircraft sales in a quarter, spread across several different airlines. In executive aviation, we had a record second quarter sales, a solid backlog as demand for light and larger business jets continue to grow. Backlogging service and support and defence and security also grew from the prior quartas level. In summary, it was the best sales quarter since mid twenty nineteen. This gives us confidence in our plans for future revenue growth and improvements. Moving to slide eight, you can see the continuous improvement in aircraft deliveries compared last year and both commercial aviation and executive aviation. In commercial aviation, we delivered fourteen aircrafts in the quarter. This represents a fifty six percent increase compared to the prior quarter and two hundred fifty percent increase compared to the second quarter in twenty twenty. Year-to-date deliveries we were at 23, almost two and a half times higher than the same period in the prior year. Of these 23 delivers, 14 were E two's, compared to four E two's in the same period last year. Sales continues to perform very well for D two as the most efficient right size single aisle aircraft for the world post pandemic. In executive aviation, we delivered twelve jets, light jets and eight larger jets, for a total of twenty aircrafts in the second quarter. This represents a fifty four percent increase compared to both first quarter twenty twenty one and the second quarter of the prior year. Year to date, delivered uh executive aviation delivered thirty three aircraft, a fifty percent increase compared to the first half of twenty twenty. As noted in the guideline to the guidance twenty twenty one it will publish this morning. We expect deliveries of commercial jets to reach between forty five to fifty fifty aircrafts and executive jets to reach between nin ninetyety to five aircraft. On slide nine, we show Embraer's net revenue. Embraer had a solid revenue growth in the quarter as all four business units rebround strongly from the pandemic. Our top line more than doubled compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth came primarily from higher deliveries in commercial aviation, although all our segments showed much improved growth during the quarter. Year to date narrow net revenue was just under two billion, as seven hundred sixty-seven million or sixty-five percent increase over twenty twenty. Net revenue breakdown by business show embraer diversification, with commercial aviation representing thirty four percent of the total revenues, service and support twenty eight, executive aviation twenty two and defence sixteen percent. It's important to highlight the strong recovery in commercial aviation, as this business was severely impacted by the pandemic last year. Slide ten. S DNA expenses reduction continues to trend very favorably over the last six quarters. We remain highly focused on S GNA efficiencies that are being implemented since the company's restructuring last year. Although the second quarter had a slight increase in GNA, this was primarily driven by increase in provision for profit sharing and performance based incentives program due to better expected results for the company in twenty twenty one as compared to 2020. Combined with the consolidation of expenses from Tempest, our new cybersecurity company acquired in the end of 2020. Sell expenses remain at historical low levels. Compared to the prior quarters, sell expenses increased four percent, while net revenue increased over forty percent sequentially. As percentage of net revenue send expenses was four point two percent in the second quarter, compared to five point seven percent in the first quarter. We achieved these results by leveraging your sales activity as volume increase, combined with a more cost efficiency digital sales effort. Slide eleven shows are adjusted a bit and adjusted a BTDA. We are very encouraged by the strong market performance across all business segments in the second quarter. Our adjusted margin was nine point three percent, up thirteen percentage points over the first quarter. Our adjusted a bit of the margin was in double digits at fourteen percent or up s over sixteen percent of the points from the first quarter. Both of these profitability metrics have recovered to the levels not seen before twenty twenty. For the first first half of twenty twenty one, our adjusted abit margin was three point nine percent and our adjusted abit margin was nine point two percent, both well above prior year level. These improvements come from several factors, including higher deliveries, resulting in higher revenue, better gross margin on improved pricing, mixed production efficiency, fixed cost leveraging on higher volumes, and favourable tax obligation reversal of this quarter of approximately twenty-five million. All of our segments have much better performance in the second quarter. Adjusted a bit margin by segment in the second quarter were as follows. Commercial aviation was at one point seven percent negative, which, although negative, shows a great improvement from last year. Executive aviation was at positive eight percent, with a strong price discipline and consistent profitability. Defence and security was at positive twenty five percent, led by Supertocano deliveries, along with positive adjustments on certain defence contracts. And service and support was at nineteen percent as a strong contribution from spare parts programmes. Slide twelve shows our adjusted net income. It was positive forty four million or twenty four cents per ADS in the second quarter. This represents the first net profit on a quarterly basis since twenty eighteen. The recovery in adjusted net income is primarily driven by improved operating margins. Reductions in financial leverage also contribute to improved profitability, and any future debt reduction would naturally have an additional positive impact on earnings. Moving to slide thirteen, I'd like to begin with free cash flow. Free cash flow in the second quarter was positive forty-five million, two hundred and seventy-two million higher than first quarter, and five hundred seventeen million higher than the same period of last year. This is a remarkable achievement. Although ye to date the cash flow is negative one hundred eighty one million, this is compared with a free cash flow burden of around a billion of the first half of twenty twenty. We expect positive free cash flow from the second half of the year to of the twenty twenty one, as indicated in the this morning guidance. Now to investment. Our total investments were fifty million in the second quarter and eighty nine million year to date, both of which are in line with last year levels. This is important because it shows we continue to invest in our future. We have been very judicious in balancing the need to invest our future with the need to preserve cash. Slide fourteen shows our cash and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with two point forty nine billion cash and cash equivalents, a slight increase from the end of the first quarter. Our debt balance was at four point three billion, a slight decrease from three months ago. Our average debt maturity remains at four years. We expect to continue to generate cash in the second half of twenty twenty one and beyond so our leverage will naturally decrease. This will corresponding reduce our net interest and expenses and have an additional positive impact on that income. Finally, moving to slide sixteen. Embraer has published two thousand twenty one financial deliveries guidance for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Despite risks of the economic recovery, vaccination rates around the world, and with a solid first half and good visibility for the remainder of the year, we decided to share the market our targets for twenty twenty one. We expect to deliver between fifty four to fifty air commercial jets, just to correct forty four forty five to fifty commercial aircrafts in twenty twenty one and ninety to ninety five executive jets in the year. We have a good confidence in those figures as our skyline are red field for both segments. Combined with the growth in defence and security and continued the recovery in the service and support traffic recovered globally, we expect consolidated revenues to be between four to four and a half billion dollars this year, representing a low double divid growth at the midpoint compared to the last year. Adjusted the VIT margin should be in the range of three to four percent, and adjusted Ebitina for twenty twenty one should be between eight point five to nine point five percent. Ibrahim has had in the first half of twenty twenty margin in these ranges, as we expect these good margins to repeat in the second half of the year. It's important to mention that those margins include costs related to the reintegration of commercial aviation as well as expenses related to the arbitration process. Finally, our free cash flow guidance is for is a range from free cash flow users of one hundred fifty million to a break even for two thousand twenty one. We had hundred eighty one million of free cash flow users in the first half of the year. So we are anticipating MBR to generate up to one hundred eighty million cash in the second half of twenty twenty one without any cash inflows from MA programs. With that, I conclude my presentation and hand it back over to Francisco for his final remarks. Thank you very much thanks, Antonio. The second quarter results and the guidance for the year reinforce our confidence in our strategy. And this confidence motivates us to accelerate the performance improvements and the delivery of our long term strategic plan, with focus and discipline. As I have mentioned in the past, this year is one of recovery. And next year and beyond, we plan to capture embroideres' full potential to grow with profitability. Looking ahead, we foresee in the middle term the potential to double the size of the company, and that doesn't include new strategic projects. We are going to be bigger and stronger, focusing not only on the top line but also much higher profitability. We are already showing some positive results of the hard work our united and motivated teams of employees have done over the past several months. With expectation for positive operating profit this year and much better, free cash flow performance with a clear potential to break even for the year. This will be supplemented by partnerships and new programmes to drive even higher growth opportunities. We are also advancing on our ESG journey and right after the QA session we will share with you our new ESG commitments. I invite everyone, therefore, to remain online for these ESG events, which will start just after the results QA. Also, we are looking forward to a new chapter of Embraer, with our extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday. We expect our shareholders to approve the election of two international board members with extensive global aerospace industry experience, following constructive feedback from analysts and shareholders to improve our corporate governance. These candidates have deep technical knowledge, strategic profiles and an innovative thought process. Finally, I will close it today by thanking everyone for this strong quarter. It always starts with our people and their focus and passion on executing our strategic planning. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we are a different company today. We are in a process of transformation and we are moving fast. Thank you for your interest and confidence in our company. Over to you Filippi. Thank you very much, Francisco. And before we continue, we'd like to show you a video. Check this out. The world is a different place to a year ago. Industries have changed. Aviation perhaps more than any other. We're already on a path that will make us bigger and stronger, and with an all-new product portfolio that are the most efficient and technologically advanced in their class, all built with the passion to improve sustainability, economics, cost efficiencies, and driving new innovations. We're better adapted to the challenges and opportunities of now. Like our customers, we're always looking above and beyond what was previously thought possible. That's why the world looks to Embraer. We are right for the world ahead. Right now. Embraer. Challenge. And now let's move on to our questions and answer session. We are preparing the set here and remember that questions can only be sent through the Reuters platform. Eduardo Couto will be our moderator, and he already has some questions with him. Eduardo, over to you. Thanks Philippe. We start now the QA. So let me see the questions that we have. Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question. I mean at this point of time we can say that uh the negotiation is moving very well, I would say. We are very optimistic with this process. Okay. Uh moving on to questions. Second question we have. What work has Embraer been doing to develop electric aircraft and making this product more viable for customers. Well we we had our first technical flight recently with the Ipanema Full Electric and uh we hope to present this aircraft to the to the public soon and continue to to invest in this uh electrification field as one of the one of the innovations uh innovation fronts that we have I mean to be in line with the ESG uh activities that we are moving fast uh uh in Embraer. Great. Uh third question we have from investors is from uh Vitor Misuzaki from Bradesco. He said the fans showed a material gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Can you give her more details about that, Antonio? Uh First one was the supercannel delivery that we were not able to deliver in Q one that flows to the Q two figures. In addition to it, we have the uh uh adjustment and the defense contract we have in the local currency in Brazil. I I would say both effects higher deliveries and supertocano and the adjustment in the contracts lead us to this twenty five percent margin in Q two. Okay, very good. Uh next question comes from uh UBS. Uh could you comment on the twenty five million reversal mentioned in the press release? Also, what was the positive cost based revision uh related on the results. So thanks for the question. First point we we built up a provision in twenty eighteen for the Brazilian guys here, designeração de folha that we have a claim discussed been discussed since twenty eighteen and we we were able to gain this uh this claim uh in second quarter. That's why we reversed the the stack position. That was also already adjusted in twenty eighteen. That's why we also consider in our results. The second question was in in regards to the contracts. We have an adjustment here around ten million dollars and the second quarter. That were both effects. It's important also to mention that even that we have this tax reversal, twenty five million, let's put first quarter and second quarter. We do have other types of costs that we are not adjusting. That's also not I would say uh for example, reintegration of commercial aviation and arbitration costs, which is more or less net this twenty five million I would say the numbers we are seeing right now I would say combined Q1 and Q2 is really uh for me describe the real performance of the company. Updates on your E Vital initiatives would be very helpful, particularly on negotiations with Zenite. We already talked a little bit, but maybe an update of the Evital. Uh Francisco Arent time yeah well we as I said we are very excited with this uh with this initiative with this product I mean we we had uh the the first flight with the prototype scale one to three a successful test by the way. Now we are preparing the the the next uh next test with the prototype uh scale uh one to one and uh technically it's moving very well we are we are planning the certification by twenty twenty five and entering service in twenty twenty six. And about the negotiation with Zanait I mentioned already that's moving very well. Okay, very good. Now moving to business jets, we have a question from Credit Suisse. Um uh business jet has been very strong uh and on the first quarter results you mentioned half uh of the the delivers were for first time buyers. In the second quarter, how much were first time buyers? Maybe we can give an overview of the business jet market. I can do it I would say uh today in our backlog the portion of first time buyers I would say is a third, something like thirty percent in our backlog and delivers for the whole year. We are talking about thirty percent first time buyers. And we are going with the market if you see the industry book to be between one to five to two to one, uh one to five to one and two to one to two. And we are I would say a little bit above that and it's doing pretty well but for sure the first buy is pushing also the market especially in the light jets category. Uh now there is a question on commercial from Credit Suisse. Your guidance for commercial deliveries of forty five to fifty seems low given your you have already delivered twenty-three uh jets. Uh are there any supply chain issues that could prevent you from being above uh that range? Uh also they are asking what do you see in terms of delivers for twenty twenty two? Any any colour on that? what we are giving as a guidance to deliver this year is a little bit higher than last year. Last year we delivered forty four and for sure we are selling more but it's going to impact more twenty twenty two. And the fact that we we deliver at the twenty three aircraft is because it's well divided throughout the year. That's why the the forty seven uh I would say between fifty uh forty five to fifty is the number ha we are having and we do see I would say around thirty percent for next year, between sixty five to seventy aircraft. But has to be confirmed but it's more or less the number you are seeing. It's important to mention we do see commercial aviation coming back to historical levels at the Ember, uh from twenty twenty three onwards we are selling more, but the sales country we are closing right now is going to fulfill the skyline starting twenty twenty two and twenty twenty one is more or less the same level from twenty twenty. Uh if allow me to I'd like to to to make a link between this uh answer and the result of the company. It is true that in this first half of the year, comparing to the first half of uh last year, we did much better in terms of deliveries, in terms of results. The numbers speak by themselves. But if you look at the the guide the guides for the for the entire year, you see that uh no, as planet, we won't see a huge increase in volumes in the in the commercial or or executive. Yes, we are seeing some some growth, moderate growth this year compared to to the last year. But the improvements in the results, I mean either uh the the EBIT coming from almost minus three percent last year to something between three and four percent this year, or the free cash flow from minus nine hundred million last year to something between minus one hundred fifty and zero this year, all this good performance is is came from efficiency gains, pure efficiency gains. We really did a good right size in the organization. We are improving uh uh I mean a lot of activities on cost reduction, on inventory reduction uh in all the company, you know, I mean pushing uh sales for the future. So again, I mean from next year on, I mean we we expect that uh we with the with the with the stronger growth in the in the in the volumes, in all the the business units, and with this uh more efficient and agile company then we see uh much better performance. So that's why our result uh is coming from this year, from efficient gains, from some additional sales of course, but mailing from efficiency gains. And just to complete in the question for supply chain issues, huh? What we are putting the guidance in what we agreed with our customers for this year. At least for the commercial version having not seen any supplier chain I would say problems this year. We have uh several other questions, so the next one is related to margins and free cash flow. So the question is how do we see margins per business in the long term? And uh and what sort of free cash flow conversion? Ibidai into free cash flow conversion. So I in regards to margin, we do see uh let's in a long term perspective, we do see service and support double digit as it is today. We do see executive in the sense single higher digit, and we we are more or less today. And we do see the the commercial aviation. I would say mid single digit close between three to five percent in the long term. That's what we see in regards to profitability for the company and in regards to the cash the conversion from a bit that you uh I would prefer to talk we are seeing today a fifty percent conversion from a bit to cash flow. We still needed to improve something, but it's more or less the metrics I'm using internally, we do see today in the long run fifty percent of their B IT being converted into cash for the years to come. So the next question is uh from JP Morgan, Marcello Mootta. Any update on the sales campaigns for commercial aviation? Could we see more orders during the second quarter? announced this uh sales for for skywest with uh sixteen aircraft and uh yes we uh we have more to come by the way the skywest it's not part of the backlogging Q2 now we are going to book these seventy aircrafts in Q three. Seventeen aircraft, correct. Thank you, Antonio. There is a question here from Lucas uh from Santander uh talking about you know inflation. Can you please comment on how the company seeing the raw material inflation and how is the company offsetting this impact? uh we do see in our final products inflation I would say all index we have with our suppliers between two to three percent for next year and to to the customer side. We have also the the re adjustment clause with the index I would say. Our uh takeaway for next year is a balance between what we have internally inflation and the pass-through to the customer base. That's more or less what we are seeing. But there is in some indicators a spike in deflation in the index for next year that we we are going to discuss with our customer base. Moreover, we do have we did this year and we are doing this year and with that we do have also a lot of design to value activities inside Empire to reduce the base of the costs we have today, without any impactful any inflation or indicators. Very good. So now moving to new projects. There is a question from Rio Verde Investimentos. Any update That was a good question. Well this front is also moving very well, especially with uh with the most uh uh with the recent interest of uh US airlines in that product. So we we see that product as a as a good alternative for for that market and other markets as well and also as a preparation for for new technology in the future. So we are we are very optimistic and working hard to you know to to accelerate this uh partnership front. Okay, um I think we have at least one final question. It's back to commercial aviation. What do you expect it it's from a WTS? What do you expect in the mid to long term in commercial aviation as we are seeing recovering demand for flights and also renewal for having more sustainable fleets. Uh again we have uh no I mean globally ninety four percent of the Embor Air Fleet back in the skies. In the US I mean uh ninety seven percent of the Embor Air Fleet is is is flying again. So it shows that the the recovery in the domestic market really is coming and that's why we are we are working in very in very uh sales can a lot of sales campaigns in that segment for E ones and uh E twos as well. So we we we are working hard to take advantage of this moment. As Antonio mentioned that we see volumes growing, I mean in two thousand twenty, but uh s strongly from two thousand uh two thousand twenty two but strongly from two thousand twenty three onwards. Um I think a final question uh it's related to defense. Can you please comment on the expectations for new KC three hundred ninety orders? Well it's uh uh as I said in the in the opening we are working in the in many in many sales campaigns for for important sales campaigns for the K C twenty and also I mean we are working in the to develop partnerships that will help us to open uh new markets for that great uh aircraft. Uh I think that that's what we had on the QA. Um so I think uh that concludes the QA. Uh I wanna thank you all for for the questions and the time. So now uh Antonio Francisco no comes. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. So thanks for for for your interest in supporting our company. We are living a really special moment. As I said before, this year is the year of uh recovery, the year of turnaround and of Embraer and the numbers as I said before speak by themselves. We expect uh to have uh a much better year in twenty twenty one compared to the to the last year, coming from a very tough crisis, as you know, and we hope to no we expect to capture the new Embraer uh potential from to grow from twenty twenty two onwards. So thank you very much for your support. quarter twenty twenty one financial results presentation. Thank you very much for your participation.",

I hope that, uh, all of you are well and safe, and thank you for your interest in our company. As you will see in Antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were strong. The Q2 results are a clear example that our strategic planning has been well executed with the right focus and discipline showing significant improvement in our financial performance. Before we go into more details regarding the Q2 results, I'd like to highlight the good momentum we are going in the different business segments. In commercial aviation, we announce that a new firm order for third E195-E2 from the Canadian Porter Airlines' with, uh, purchase rights for 50 more aircraft. We also announce that new firm orders for 34 E175 jets to Horizon Air and Sky West to be operated for Alaska Airlines and the Delta Air Lines. These new orders and other activity campaigns reiterate the continuous interest in the E jet family as the best option in the regional aviation market. In as executive aviation, we keep up the momentum with the record sales in the quarter. We maintained our price discipline strategy and had a strong backlog growth with book to build in excess of two to one for this business. In the defense insecurity, we delivered seven Super Tucano aircraft in the first half of the year. Also, we had strong performance in our cybersecurity and systems integration companies with double digit revenue growth in the first half of this year, compared to the first half of last year. Further, in the second quarter, the KC-390 Millennium reached an important milestone by successfully performing unpaved runway tests. Although we are currently in negotiations with the Brazilian Air Force on the KC-390 Millennium contract, we're continuing to be focused on the new export sales campaigns for this aircraft, as well as the Super Tucano. In services and support, we are pleased with the strong second quarter results with better revenues and higher margins as traffic recovery and a strong maintenance activity drove 55% revenue growth in the second quarter. It is exciting to see the continued positive sales activity in services with due signed with several important customers across all markets and at OGMA, driving backlog, backlog expansion for this segment during the period. This was further highlighted by the contract we signed with Porter Airlines for a 20 year total support program. With respect to innovation, we continue to make progress on partnerships in the urban air mobility ecosystem through our subsidiary, if in a segment with a strong growth potential in the years to come. In addition, our service collaborative platform Beacon, signed agreements with key customers, such as Republic for its maintenance applications. Finally, on the operations front, we continue to see great improvements. We expect a 16% increase in inventory returns compared to 2020 and a 20% reduction in production cycle time of our aircraft this year, positively impacting working capital and production costs. I will now hand it over to an Antonio Garcia, our CFO, to give further details on the financial results and I will return in the end. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco. And good morning, everyone. I will start for our backlog for the quarter. On slide seven, the graph shows we ended the second quarter at 59 billion up 1.7 billion or 12% from the prior quarter. This represent a return to the same 15.9 billion we were at in 2020 before the pandemic began. In our commercial aviation business, we closed 48 aircraft sales in the quarter, is spread across several different airlines, In executive aviation, we had to record second quarter sales, a solid backlog as demand for light and larger business that continue to grow. Backlog service and support and defense and security also grew from the prior, prior quarter level. In summary, it was the best sales quarter since mid June, 2019. This give us confidence in our plans for future revenue growth and improvements. Moving to slide eight, you can see the continuous improvement in aircraft delivers compared last year and both commercial aviation, executive aviation. In commercial aviation, we delivered 14 aircraft in the quarter. This represents a 56% increase compared to the prior quarter and 250% increase compared to the second quarter in 2020. Year to date delivers, we were at 23, almost two and a half times higher than the same period in the prior year. Of these 23 delivers, 14 were each choose compared to four each choose in the same period last year. Sales continues to perform very well for the two as the most efficient right side of single oil aircraft for the world post-pandemic. In executive aviation, we delivered 12 l- jets, light jets, and eight larger jets for a total of 20 aircraft in the second quarter. This represents 54% increase compare to both first quarter, 2021 and the second quarter part of the prior year. Year to date delivered, uh, executive aviation delivered 33 aircraft, a 50% increase compared to the first half of 2020. As noted in the guideline, the guidelines 2021, we published this morning, we expect delivers of commercial jets to reach between 45 to 50, 50 aircraft and executive jets to reach between 90 to 95. Aircraft. On the slide nine, we show Embraer net revenue. Embraer had the solid revenue growth in the quarter as all four business units rebrand is stronger from the pandemic. Our top line more than doubles compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth came primarily from higher deliveries in commercial aviation, although all our segments showed much improved growth during the quarter. Year to date narrow, net revenue was just under 2 billion, that's 767 million or 65% increase over 2020. Net revenue breakdown by business show Embraer diversification, with commercial aviation representing 34% of the total revenues, service and support at 28, executive aviation, 22, and defense 16%. It's important to highlight the strong recovering commercial aviation as this b- The strong recovering commercial aviation, as this business was severely impacted by the pandemic last year, is like, 10 SG&A expenses reduction continues to trend very favorably over the last six quarters. We remain highly focused on SG&A efficiencies that are being implemented since the component inaudible last year. Although the second quarter has a slight increase in SG&A this was primarily driven by increase in provision for inaudible and performance based inaudibleprogram due to better expected results for the company 2021 as compared to 2020 Combined with consolidation of expenses from Pampus, our new cyber security component acquired in the end of 2020. Selling expenses remains an historical low levels compared to the prior quarters, selling expenses increased 4% while net revenue increased over 40% sequentially. As percentage of net revenue, selling expenses was 4.2% in the second quarter compared to 5.7% in the first quarter. We achieved this results by leveraging our sales activity as volume increased combined with some more cost efficiency digital sales effort. It is like, a 11 shows are adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA. We are very encouraged by this stock market performance across all business segments in the second quarter. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 9.3% up 13 percentage points over the first quarter. Our adjusted EBIT margin was in double digits at 14% or up over 16 percentage points from the first quarter. Both of these profitability matrix have recovered to the level that was seen before 2020. For the first half of 2021, our adjusted EBIT margin was 0.9% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.2%, both well above prior year level. This improvement comes from several factors including higher delivers, resulting in higher revenue, better growth margin on improved pricing, mixed product efficiency, fixed cost leverage on higher volumes and favorable tax obligation, reversal of this quarter of approximately 25 million. All of our segment has much better performance in the second quarter, adjusted EBIT margin by segment in the second quarter were as follows. Commercial aviation was at 1.7% negative, which although negative, shows a great improvement from last year. Executive aviation was at positive 8% with a strong price discipline and consistent profitability. Defensive security was at positive 25% led by Super Tucanos delivers along with positive adjustments on certain defense contracts. And serves and support was at 19% as a strong contribution from the spare parts programs. inaudible shows our adjusted net income. It was positive for inaudible in the second quarter. This represents the first net profit on a quarterly basis since 2018. They are recovering against net income, is primarily driven by improved operative margins, reduction in financial leverage also contributes to improved profitability and any future that redemption would naturally have any additional positive impact on earnings. inaudibleI would like to begin with free cash flow. Free cash flow in the second quarter was positively 45 million, 272 million higher than first quarter and 570 million higher than the same period of last year. This is a remarkable achievement. Although, here to-date the cash flow is negative 181 million, this is compared if you have free cash flow built of around a billion of the first half of 2020. We expect positive free cash flow from the second half of the year of 2021 as indicated in this morning guidance. Now to investments. Our total investments were 50 million in the second quarter and 89 million year-to-date both of which are in line with last year levels. This is important because it shows we continue to invest in our future. We have been very adjusting the balancing the need to invest our future with the need to preserve cash. It is like inaudible shows our cash and liquidity position. We end up the quarter with two points, 49 billion cash and cash equivalents. I like to increase it from the end of the first quarter. Our debt balancing was at 4.3 billion, a light decrease from 3 months ago. Our average debt maturity remains at 4 years. We expect to continually generate cash in the second half of 2021 and beyond so our leverage will naturally decrease. This will correspondingly reduce our net interest and expense and have an additional positive impact on net income. Finally, inaudible Embraer has published 2021 financial delivers guidance for the first time since the start of pandemic. Despite of risks of economy recovery, vaccination rates around the world and with the solid first half and good visibility for the remaining of the year, we decided to share the inaudible our targets for 2021. We expect to deliver between 54 to 50 at commercial jets, just to correct 45 to 50 commercial aircraft in 2021 and 90 to 95 ejector jets in the year. We have good confidence in both figures as our skyline are inaudible filled for both segments combined with the inaudible credit and continue to recovering the services support inaudible recover globally, we expect consolidated revenues to be between 4 and 4.5 billion dollars this year, representing a low inaudible which grow at the media point compared to the last year. Adjusted inaudiblemodule should be in the range of 3 to 4% and adjusted inaudible for 2021 should be between 8.5% to 9.5%. Embraer has had in the first half of 2020 margin in these ranges as we expect these good margins to repeat in the second half of the year. It is important to mention that those margins includes cost related to the integration of commercial aviation as well as expenses related to the arbitration process. Finally, our free cash flow guidance is arranged from free cash flow users of 150 million total break-even for 2021. We had 181 million of free cash users in the first half of the year, so we are anticipating Embraer to generate up to 180 million cash in the second half of 2021 without any cash inflows from inaudible. With that I conclude my presentation and hand it back over to Francisco for his final remarks. Thank you very much.Thanks Antonio. The second quarter results and the guidance for the year reinforce our confidence in our strategy and this confidence motivates us to accelerate the performance improvements then the delivery of our long term strategic plan with focus and discipline. As I had mentioned in the past, this year is one of recovery and next year and beyond we plan to capture, embrace full potential to grow with profitability. Looking ahead, we foresee in the mid-term the potential to double the size of the company and that doesn't include new strategic projects. We are going to be bigger and stronger, focusing not only on the top line, but also much higher profitability. We are already showing some positive results of the hard work our united and motivated teams of employees have done over the past several months. With expectation for positive operating profit this year and much better free cash flow performance with a clear potential to break-even for the year. This will be supplemented by partnerships and new programs to drive even higher growth opportunities. We are also advancing on our ESG journey and right after the Q and A session, we will share with you our new ESG commitments. I invite everyone; therefore, to remain online for this ESG event which will start just after the results Q and A. Also, we are looking forward to a new chapter of Embraer with our-… forward to a new chapter of Embraer with our extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday. We expect our shareholders to approve the election of two international board members with extensive global aerospace industry experience, following constructive feedback from analysts and shareholders to improve our corporate governance. These candidates have deep technical knowledge, strategic profiles, and an innovative thought process. Finally, I will close today by thanking everyone for this strong quarter. It always starts with our people and their focus and passion on executing our strategic planning. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we are a different company today. We are in a process of transformation and we are moving fast. Thank you for your interest and confidence in our company. Over to you, Philippi. Thank you very much, Francisco. And before we continue, we'd like to show you a video. Check this out. The world is a different place to a year ago. Industries have changed, aviation perhaps more than any other, Embraer has changed too. We're leaner, more agile, and fit for growth. We're already on a path that will make us bigger and stronger, and with an all new product portfolio that are the most efficient and technologically advanced in their class, all built with the passion to improve sustainability, economics, cost efficiencies, and driving new innovations. We're better adapted to the challenges and opportunities of now. Like our customers, we're always looking above and beyond what was previously thought possible. That's why the world looks to Embraer. We are right for the world ahead, right now. Embraer, challenge, create, outperform. And now, let's move on to our questions and answers sessions we are preparing this side here, and remember that questions can only be sent to the writers platform. Eduardo Colto will be our moderator, and he already has some questions with him. Eduardo, over to you. Thanks. Um, thanks Philippi, we start now the Q&A. So let me see the questions that we have. Uh, a first question we have is, can you give an update on the SPAC negotiations with Eve? I don't know, uh, Francisco, Antonio, who wants to take that? Yes, thank you, I do. Thanks for the question. I mean, at this point of time, we can say that, uh, the negotiation is moving very well, I would say. We are very optimistic with this process. Okay. Uh, moving on the questions, second question we have, uh, what or- what work has Embraer been doing to develop electric aircraft in making this product more viable for customers? Uh, thank you, also good question. Well, we, we had our first technical flight recently with the Ipanema full electric. And, um, we hope to present this aircraft to the, to the public soon. And, uh, continue to, to invest in this, uh, electrification field as one of the, one of the innovations, uh, innovation fronts that we have, I mean, to be in line with the ESG, uh, activities that we are moving fast, uh, uh, in Embraer. Great. Uh, third question we have from investors is from, uh, Vitor Misosaki from Verbesco. He said, the inaudible showed a material gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Can you give a more details about that, Antonio? Uh, Vitor, thanks for the question. We, we had in the second quarter, two main facts, uh, on the defense side. First one was the Super Tucano deliver that we were not able to deliver in Q1, that flows to the Q2 figures. In addition to it, we have the, uh, uh, adjustment in the defense contract we have in the local inaudible in Brazil. I- I would say both effects, higher delivers in Super Tucano and the, uh, adjustments in the contracts lead us to this 25% margin in Q2. Okay. Very good. Uh, next question comes from, uh, UBS. Uh, could you comment on the 25 million reversal mentioned in the press release? Also, what was the positive cost base revision related, uh, uh, related on the results? So thanks for the question. First point, we, we built a provision 2018 for the Brazilian guys here, inaudible that we had a claim, discuss, been discussing 2018. And we, we were able to gain this, uh, this claim, uh, in second quarter, that's why we reversed the, this tax position. That was also already adjusted in 2018, that's why we also consider in our results. And the second question was in, in, in regards to the contracts. We have an adjustment here around $10 million in the second quarter, that were both effects. It's important also to mention that even that we have this tax reversal, 25 million, let's put first quarter, the second quarter. And we do have all the tax, of course, that we are not adjusting, that's also not, I would say, uh, for example, a reintegration of commercial aviation and arbitration costs, which is more or less net this 25 million, I would say. The numbers you are seeing right now, I would say, combined Q1 and Q2 is really, uh, for me describe the real performance of the company. Okay. Uh, we have several questions about, uh, about Eve. I will try to, to summarize them. So basically, any general updates on your Eve eVTOL initiatives? Would be very helpful, particularly all negotiations with Zanite. We already talk a little bit, but maybe an update of the eVTOL, uh, Francisco, Antonio? Yeah. Well, we, as I said, we are very excited with this, uh, with this initiative, with this product. I mean, we, we had, uh, the, the first flight with the prototype scale one to three, a successful test by the way. Now we are preparing the, the, the next, uh, next test with the prototype, uh, scale one to one. And, uh, technically, it's moving very well. We are, we are planning the certification by 2025, and entering service in 2026. And about the negotiation with Zanite, I mentioned already, that's moving very well. Okay. Very good. Now moving to business jet, we have a question from Credit Suisse. Um, uh, business jet has been very strong, uh, and in the first quarter results, you mentioned half, uh, of the delivers were for first-time buyers, in the second quarter, how much were first-time buyers? Maybe you an give an overview of the business jet market? Yeah, I can do it. Yeah. crosstalk I can say, uh, today in our backlog, the portion of first-time buyers, I would say, is a third, something like 30%. In our backlog in delivered for the whole year, we are talk about 30% first-time buyers. And we are growing with the market, if you see the industry book to be between one to five, to two to one, uh, one to five to one, and two to one to two. And we are, I would say, a little bit above that, and it's doing pretty well but for sure, the first buyers portion also inaudible in the light jets category. Uh, now there is a question on commercial from Credit Suisse. Uh, your guidance for commercial delivers of 45 to 50 seems low given your… you have already delivered 23, uh, jets. Uh, are there any supply chain issues that could prevent you from being above, uh, that range? Uh, also, they are asking, what do you see in terms of the numbers for 2022? Any, any color on that? Let's say, uh, let's take into account that commercial aviation is still suffering for the pandemic, huh? What we are giving as a guidance to deliver this year is now a little bit higher to last year. Last year, we delivered 44, and for sure, we are selling more, but it's going to impact more 2022. And the fact that we, we deliver already 23 aircraft is because it's really divided, no, uh, throughout the year. Uh, that's why the, the 47, uh, I would say between fif- uh, 45 to 50, is the number ha- we are having. And we do see, I would say, around 30% for next year, between the 65 to 70 aircraft. That has to be confirmed, but it's more or less the number we are seeing. It's important to mention, we do see commercial aviation coming back to historical levels at inaudible uh, from 2023 onwards. We are selling more but the sales quarter we are closing right now is going to fulfill this timeline starting 2022. And 2021 is more or less the same level from 2020. Uh, if inaudible Antonio, I'd like to, to, to make a link between this, uh, answer and the result of the company. It is true that, uh, in this first half of the year comparing to the first half of, uh, last year, we did much better in terms of deliveries, i- in terms of results. The numbers speak by themselves. But if you look at the, the gui- the guidance for the, for the entire year, you see that, uh, no, as planned, we won't see a huge increase in volumes in the, in the commercial or, or, or, or executive. Yes, we have seen some, some growth, now that growth gives you a compare to, to the last year. But the improvements in the results, I mean, either, uh, uh, the, the EBIT coming from almost minus 3% last year to something between 3 and 4% this year, or the free cashflow from minus 900 million last year to something between minus 150 and zero this year, all this good performance is, is came from efficiency gains, pure efficiency gains. We really did a good right size in the-… efficiency gains, pure efficiency gains. We really did a good right size in the organization, we are improving, uh, uh, I mean, a lot of activities on cost reduction, on inventory reduction, uh, uh, in all the company, you know? I mean, pushing the sales for the future. So again, I mean, from next year on, I mean, we, we expect that, uh, w- with a, with a, with a stronger growth in the, in the, in the volumes, in all the, the business units, and with this, uh, more efficient and agile company, there you see, uh, a much better performance. So that's why our result is coming from this year from efficiency gains from some additional sales, of course, but mainly from efficiency gains. And just to complete in the question from supply change issue, no? What we are put in the guidance and what we agreed with our customers for this year, at least for the commercial aviation having not seen any supplier chain, I would say, problems this year. Okay. We have, uh, several other questions, so the next one is related to margins and free cashflow. So the question is, how do we see margins per business in the long term? And, uh, and what sort of free cashflow conversion, EBITDA into free cashflow conversion does Embraer expect? Antonio. So I… in regards to margin, we do see, uh, let's in the long term perspective, we do see service and support double digit as it is today. We do see executive in the sales single higher digit area we are more or less in also today. And we so see the, the commercial aviation, I would say, uh, mid-single digit, close between 3 to 5% in the long term. That's what we see. In regards to profitability for the company and in regards to the cash… the conversion from EBITDA to, uh, EBIT, today I would prefer to talk, we are seeing today a 50% conversion from EBIT to cashflow. We still need d- to improve something, but it's more or less the inaudible use internally, we do see today in the longer run, 50% of the EBIT being converted into cash for the years to come. So the next question is, uh, from JP Morgan, inaudible. In what rate on the sales campaigns for commercial aviation could we see more orders during the second quarter? Yeah, good question. Yes, we, we have a lot of, uh, active, uh, sales campaigns ongoing on our commercial aviation. We, we just announced this sales for, for SkyWest with, uh, 16 aircraft, and, uh, yes, we are… we have more to come. By the way, the SkyWest, it's not part of the backlog in Q2, no? We are going to book this 17 aircraft in Q3. 17 aircraft, correct, aircraft, correct. Thank you, Antonio. Uh, there is a question here from Lucas, uh, from Santander, uh, talking about, you know, inflation. Can you please comment on how the company see the raw material inflation, and how is the company offsetting this impact? I would say, uh, we do see in our final products, inflation, I would say. On index, we have with our suppliers, between 2 to 3% for next year, and to, to the customer side, we have also the, the real adjustment clause with the index, I would say. Uh, our, uh, takeaway for next year is a balance between what we have internal inflation, and the passover to the customer base. That's more or less what we are seeing, but there is in some indicators, uh, a spark in deflation with the index for next year, that we, we are going to discuss for our customer base. Moreover, we do have, we did this year and we, we are doing this year, and we tha- we do have also a lot of design inaudible inside Embraer to reduce the base of the cost we have today, without any impact on any inflation or indicators. Very good. So now moving to new projects, there is a question from inaudible And what date are the partnerships for the turboprop aircraft? Also good question. Well, this front is also moving very well, especially with a, with the moves, uh, uh, with the recent interest of, uh, US airlines in that product. So we, we see that product as a, as a good alternative for, for that market and other market as well, and also, as a preparation for, for new technology in the future. So we are, we are very optimistic and working hard to, you know, to a- to accelerate this, uh, partnership front. Okay. Um, I think we have at least one final question. It's back to commercial aviation. What do you expect… It- It's from, uh, WTS, what do you expect in the mid to long term in commercial aviation as we are seeing recovery in demand for flights and also renewal for having more sustainable fleets? Yeah, good question. Thank you, sure. A- Again, we have, uh, you know, I mean, globally, 94% of the Embraer fleet back in the skies in the US, I mean, uh, uh, 97% of the Embraer fleet is, is, is flying again. So it shows that the, the recovery in the domestic market really is coming, and that's why we, we are working in very, in very, uh, serious camp- a lot of serious campaigns in that segment, for E1s and, uh, E2s as well. So we, we, we are working hard to take advantage of this moment. As Antonio mentioned that we see volumes growing, I mean, in 2020, but, uh, s- strongly from 2000… uh, uh, 2022, but strongly from 2023 onwards. Um, I think a final question, uh, it's related to defense. Can you please comment on the expectations for new inaudible orders? Well, it's, uh, uh, as I said in the, in the opening, we are working in the, in many, in many sales campaigns for, for employed sales campaigns for the inaudible. And also, I mean, we are working in the… to develop partnerships that will help us to open, uh, new markets for that great, uh, aircraft. Uh, I think that, that's what we had on the Q&A. Um, so I think, uh, that concludes the Q&A. Um, I wanna thank you all for, for the questions and the time. So now, yeah, Antonio or Francisco, no comments? Okay. Thank you all. Yeah, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. So thanks for, for, for your interest in supporting our company. We are living a really a special moment. As I said before, this year is the year of, uh, recovery, the year of turnaround, and… for Embraer, and the numbers, as I said before, speak by themselves. We expect, uh, to have, uh, a much better year in 2021 compared to the, to the last year, coming from a very tough crisis, as you know. And we hope to, you know, we expect to capture the new Embraer, uh, potential from… to grow from 2022 onwards. So thank you very much for your support. Thank you. Thank you. So this concludes today's Q&A session, that in turn concludes Embraer's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Presentation. Thank you very much for your participation.",

Participants on today's conference are Francisco Gomes Neto, President and CEO, Antonio Carlos Garcia, Chief Financial Officer and Procurement, and Eduardo Couto, Director of Investor Relations. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Francisco Gomez Neto. Please go ahead, Francisco. Thank you, Philippe. Good morning to all and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that all of you are well and safe, and thank you for your interest in our company. As you will see in Antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were strong. The Q two results are a clear example that our strategic planning has been well executed, with the right focus and discipline, showing significant improvement in our financial performance. Before we go into more details regarding the Q two results, I'd like to highlight the good momentum we are going in the different business segments. In commercial aviation, we announced a new firm order for third E one ninety five E two jets from the Canadian Porter Airlines, with purchase rights for fifty more aircraft. We also announced new firm orders for thirty four E one hundred seventy five jets to Horizon Air and Sky West, to be operated for Alaska Airlines and Delta Airlines. These new orders and other active campaigns reiterate the continuous interest in the e Jet family as the best option in the regional aviation market. In executive aviation, we keep up the momentum with record sales in the quarter. We maintained our price discipline strategy and had a strong backlog growth with book to bill in excess of two to one for this business. In defence and security, we delivered seven super Tucano aircraft in the first half of the year. Also, we had strong performance in our cybersecurity and systems integration companies, with double digit revenue growth in the first half of this year, compared to the first half of last year. Further, in the second quarter, the KC three hundred ninety Millennium reached an important milestone by successfully performing unpaved runaway tests. Although we are currently in negotiations with the Brazilian Air Force on the K C twenty nineteen millennium contract, we continue to be focused on the new export sales campaigns for this aircraft as well as the Supertocano. In services and support, we are pleased with strong second quarter results, with better revenues and higher margins, as traffic recovery and strong maintenance activity drove fifty five percent revenue growth in the second quarter. It is exciting to see the continued positive sales activity in services, with deals signed with several important customers across all markets and at OGMA, driving backlog expansion for this segment during the period. This was further highlighted by the contract we signed with Porter Airlines for a twenty year total support programme. With respect to innovation, we continue to make progress on partnerships in the urban air mobility ecosystem through our subsidiary IV in a segment with strong growth potential in the years to come. In addition, our services collaborative platform Beacon signed agreements with key customers such as Republic for its maintenance applications. Finally, on the operations front, we continue to see great improvements. We expect a sixteen percent increase in inventory turns compared to twenty twenty and a twenty percent reduction in production cycle time of our aircraft this year, positively impacting working capital and production costs. I will now hand it over to Antonio Garcia, our CFO, to give further details on the financial results and I will return in the end. Thank you. Thank you, Francisco, and good morning everyone. I will start with our backlog for the quarter. On slide seven, the graph shows we ended the second quarter at fifty nine billion, up one point seven billion or twelve percent from the prior quarter. This represent a return to the same fifteen point nine billion we were at in twenty twenty, before the pandemic began. In our commercial aviation business, we closed forty eight aircraft sales in a quarter, spread across several different airlines. In executive aviation, we had a record second quarter sales, a solid backlog as demand for light and larger business jets continue to grow. Backlogging service and support and defence and security also grew from the prior quartas level. In summary, it was the best sales quarter since mid twenty nineteen. This gives us confidence in our plans for future revenue growth and improvements. Moving to slide eight, you can see the continuous improvement in aircraft deliveries compared last year and both commercial aviation and executive aviation. In commercial aviation, we delivered fourteen aircrafts in the quarter. This represents a fifty six percent increase compared to the prior quarter and two hundred fifty percent increase compared to the second quarter in twenty twenty. Year-to-date deliveries we were at 23, almost two and a half times higher than the same period in the prior year. Of these 23 delivers, 14 were E two's, compared to four E two's in the same period last year. Sales continues to perform very well for D two as the most efficient right size single aisle aircraft for the world post pandemic. In executive aviation, we delivered twelve jets, light jets and eight larger jets, for a total of twenty aircrafts in the second quarter. This represents a fifty four percent increase compared to both first quarter twenty twenty one and the second quarter of the prior year. Year to date, delivered uh executive aviation delivered thirty three aircraft, a fifty percent increase compared to the first half of twenty twenty. As noted in the guideline to the guidance twenty twenty one it will publish this morning. We expect deliveries of commercial jets to reach between forty five to fifty fifty aircrafts and executive jets to reach between nin ninetyety to five aircraft. On slide nine, we show Embraer's net revenue. Embraer had a solid revenue growth in the quarter as all four business units rebround strongly from the pandemic. Our top line more than doubled compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth came primarily from higher deliveries in commercial aviation, although all our segments showed much improved growth during the quarter. Year to date narrow net revenue was just under two billion, as seven hundred sixty-seven million or sixty-five percent increase over twenty twenty. Net revenue breakdown by business show embraer diversification, with commercial aviation representing thirty four percent of the total revenues, service and support twenty eight, executive aviation twenty two and defence sixteen percent. It's important to highlight the strong recovery in commercial aviation, as this business was severely impacted by the pandemic last year. Slide ten. S DNA expenses reduction continues to trend very favorably over the last six quarters. We remain highly focused on S GNA efficiencies that are being implemented since the company's restructuring last year. Although the second quarter had a slight increase in GNA, this was primarily driven by increase in provision for profit sharing and performance based incentives program due to better expected results for the company in twenty twenty one as compared to 2020. Combined with the consolidation of expenses from Tempest, our new cybersecurity company acquired in the end of 2020. Sell expenses remain at historical low levels. Compared to the prior quarters, sell expenses increased four percent, while net revenue increased over forty percent sequentially. As percentage of net revenue send expenses was four point two percent in the second quarter, compared to five point seven percent in the first quarter. We achieved these results by leveraging your sales activity as volume increase, combined with a more cost efficiency digital sales effort. Slide eleven shows are adjusted a bit and adjusted a BTDA. We are very encouraged by the strong market performance across all business segments in the second quarter. Our adjusted margin was nine point three percent, up thirteen percentage points over the first quarter. Our adjusted a bit of the margin was in double digits at fourteen percent or up s over sixteen percent of the points from the first quarter. Both of these profitability metrics have recovered to the levels not seen before twenty twenty. For the first first half of twenty twenty one, our adjusted abit margin was three point nine percent and our adjusted abit margin was nine point two percent, both well above prior year level. These improvements come from several factors, including higher deliveries, resulting in higher revenue, better gross margin on improved pricing, mixed production efficiency, fixed cost leveraging on higher volumes, and favourable tax obligation reversal of this quarter of approximately twenty-five million. All of our segments have much better performance in the second quarter. Adjusted a bit margin by segment in the second quarter were as follows. Commercial aviation was at one point seven percent negative, which, although negative, shows a great improvement from last year. Executive aviation was at positive eight percent, with a strong price discipline and consistent profitability. Defence and security was at positive twenty five percent, led by Supertocano deliveries, along with positive adjustments on certain defence contracts. And service and support was at nineteen percent as a strong contribution from spare parts programmes. Slide twelve shows our adjusted net income. It was positive forty four million or twenty four cents per ADS in the second quarter. This represents the first net profit on a quarterly basis since twenty eighteen. The recovery in adjusted net income is primarily driven by improved operating margins. Reductions in financial leverage also contribute to improved profitability, and any future debt reduction would naturally have an additional positive impact on earnings. Moving to slide thirteen, I'd like to begin with free cash flow. Free cash flow in the second quarter was positive forty-five million, two hundred and seventy-two million higher than first quarter, and five hundred seventeen million higher than the same period of last year. This is a remarkable achievement. Although ye to date the cash flow is negative one hundred eighty one million, this is compared with a free cash flow burden of around a billion of the first half of twenty twenty. We expect positive free cash flow from the second half of the year to of the twenty twenty one, as indicated in the this morning guidance. Now to investment. Our total investments were fifty million in the second quarter and eighty nine million year to date, both of which are in line with last year levels. This is important because it shows we continue to invest in our future. We have been very judicious in balancing the need to invest our future with the need to preserve cash. Slide fourteen shows our cash and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with two point forty nine billion cash and cash equivalents, a slight increase from the end of the first quarter. Our debt balance was at four point three billion, a slight decrease from three months ago. Our average debt maturity remains at four years. We expect to continue to generate cash in the second half of twenty twenty one and beyond so our leverage will naturally decrease. This will corresponding reduce our net interest and expenses and have an additional positive impact on that income. Finally, moving to slide sixteen. Embraer has published two thousand twenty one financial deliveries guidance for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Despite risks of the economic recovery, vaccination rates around the world, and with a solid first half and good visibility for the remainder of the year, we decided to share the market our targets for twenty twenty one. We expect to deliver between fifty four to fifty air commercial jets, just to correct forty four forty five to fifty commercial aircrafts in twenty twenty one and ninety to ninety five executive jets in the year. We have a good confidence in those figures as our skyline are red field for both segments. Combined with the growth in defence and security and continued the recovery in the service and support traffic recovered globally, we expect consolidated revenues to be between four to four and a half billion dollars this year, representing a low double divid growth at the midpoint compared to the last year. Adjusted the VIT margin should be in the range of three to four percent, and adjusted Ebitina for twenty twenty one should be between eight point five to nine point five percent. Ibrahim has had in the first half of twenty twenty margin in these ranges, as we expect these good margins to repeat in the second half of the year. It's important to mention that those margins include costs related to the reintegration of commercial aviation as well as expenses related to the arbitration process. Finally, our free cash flow guidance is for is a range from free cash flow users of one hundred fifty million to a break even for two thousand twenty one. We had hundred eighty one million of free cash flow users in the first half of the year. So we are anticipating MBR to generate up to one hundred eighty million cash in the second half of twenty twenty one without any cash inflows from MA programs. With that, I conclude my presentation and hand it back over to Francisco for his final remarks. Thank you very much thanks, Antonio. The second quarter results and the guidance for the year reinforce our confidence in our strategy. And this confidence motivates us to accelerate the performance improvements and the delivery of our long term strategic plan, with focus and discipline. As I have mentioned in the past, this year is one of recovery. And next year and beyond, we plan to capture embroideres' full potential to grow with profitability. Looking ahead, we foresee in the middle term the potential to double the size of the company, and that doesn't include new strategic projects. We are going to be bigger and stronger, focusing not only on the top line but also much higher profitability. We are already showing some positive results of the hard work our united and motivated teams of employees have done over the past several months. With expectation for positive operating profit this year and much better, free cash flow performance with a clear potential to break even for the year. This will be supplemented by partnerships and new programmes to drive even higher growth opportunities. We are also advancing on our ESG journey and right after the QA session we will share with you our new ESG commitments. I invite everyone, therefore, to remain online for these ESG events, which will start just after the results QA. Also, we are looking forward to a new chapter of Embraer, with our extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday. We expect our shareholders to approve the election of two international board members with extensive global aerospace industry experience, following constructive feedback from analysts and shareholders to improve our corporate governance. These candidates have deep technical knowledge, strategic profiles and an innovative thought process. Finally, I will close it today by thanking everyone for this strong quarter. It always starts with our people and their focus and passion on executing our strategic planning. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we are a different company today. We are in a process of transformation and we are moving fast. Thank you for your interest and confidence in our company. Over to you Filippi. Thank you very much, Francisco. And before we continue, we'd like to show you a video. Check this out. The world is a different place to a year ago. Industries have changed. Aviation perhaps more than any other. We're already on a path that will make us bigger and stronger, and with an all-new product portfolio that are the most efficient and technologically advanced in their class, all built with the passion to improve sustainability, economics, cost efficiencies, and driving new innovations. We're better adapted to the challenges and opportunities of now. Like our customers, we're always looking above and beyond what was previously thought possible. That's why the world looks to Embraer. We are right for the world ahead. Right now. Embraer. Challenge. And now let's move on to our questions and answer session. We are preparing the set here and remember that questions can only be sent through the Reuters platform. Eduardo Couto will be our moderator, and he already has some questions with him. Eduardo, over to you. Thanks Philippe. We start now the QA. So let me see the questions that we have. Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question. I mean at this point of time we can say that uh the negotiation is moving very well, I would say. We are very optimistic with this process. Okay. Uh moving on to questions. Second question we have. What work has Embraer been doing to develop electric aircraft and making this product more viable for customers. Well we we had our first technical flight recently with the Ipanema Full Electric and uh we hope to present this aircraft to the to the public soon and continue to to invest in this uh electrification field as one of the one of the innovations uh innovation fronts that we have I mean to be in line with the ESG uh activities that we are moving fast uh uh in Embraer. Great. Uh third question we have from investors is from uh Vitor Misuzaki from Bradesco. He said the fans showed a material gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Can you give her more details about that, Antonio? Uh First one was the supercannel delivery that we were not able to deliver in Q one that flows to the Q two figures. In addition to it, we have the uh uh adjustment and the defense contract we have in the local currency in Brazil. I I would say both effects higher deliveries and supertocano and the adjustment in the contracts lead us to this twenty five percent margin in Q two. Okay, very good. Uh next question comes from uh UBS. Uh could you comment on the twenty five million reversal mentioned in the press release? Also, what was the positive cost based revision uh related on the results. So thanks for the question. First point we we built up a provision in twenty eighteen for the Brazilian guys here, designeração de folha that we have a claim discussed been discussed since twenty eighteen and we we were able to gain this uh this claim uh in second quarter. That's why we reversed the the stack position. That was also already adjusted in twenty eighteen. That's why we also consider in our results. The second question was in in regards to the contracts. We have an adjustment here around ten million dollars and the second quarter. That were both effects. It's important also to mention that even that we have this tax reversal, twenty five million, let's put first quarter and second quarter. We do have other types of costs that we are not adjusting. That's also not I would say uh for example, reintegration of commercial aviation and arbitration costs, which is more or less net this twenty five million I would say the numbers we are seeing right now I would say combined Q1 and Q2 is really uh for me describe the real performance of the company. Updates on your E Vital initiatives would be very helpful, particularly on negotiations with Zenite. We already talked a little bit, but maybe an update of the Evital. Uh Francisco Arent time yeah well we as I said we are very excited with this uh with this initiative with this product I mean we we had uh the the first flight with the prototype scale one to three a successful test by the way. Now we are preparing the the the next uh next test with the prototype uh scale uh one to one and uh technically it's moving very well we are we are planning the certification by twenty twenty five and entering service in twenty twenty six. And about the negotiation with Zanait I mentioned already that's moving very well. Okay, very good. Now moving to business jets, we have a question from Credit Suisse. Um uh business jet has been very strong uh and on the first quarter results you mentioned half uh of the the delivers were for first time buyers. In the second quarter, how much were first time buyers? Maybe we can give an overview of the business jet market. I can do it I would say uh today in our backlog the portion of first time buyers I would say is a third, something like thirty percent in our backlog and delivers for the whole year. We are talking about thirty percent first time buyers. And we are going with the market if you see the industry book to be between one to five to two to one, uh one to five to one and two to one to two. And we are I would say a little bit above that and it's doing pretty well but for sure the first buy is pushing also the market especially in the light jets category. Uh now there is a question on commercial from Credit Suisse. Your guidance for commercial deliveries of forty five to fifty seems low given your you have already delivered twenty-three uh jets. Uh are there any supply chain issues that could prevent you from being above uh that range? Uh also they are asking what do you see in terms of delivers for twenty twenty two? Any any colour on that? what we are giving as a guidance to deliver this year is a little bit higher than last year. Last year we delivered forty four and for sure we are selling more but it's going to impact more twenty twenty two. And the fact that we we deliver at the twenty three aircraft is because it's well divided throughout the year. That's why the the forty seven uh I would say between fifty uh forty five to fifty is the number ha we are having and we do see I would say around thirty percent for next year, between sixty five to seventy aircraft. But has to be confirmed but it's more or less the number you are seeing. It's important to mention we do see commercial aviation coming back to historical levels at the Ember, uh from twenty twenty three onwards we are selling more, but the sales country we are closing right now is going to fulfill the skyline starting twenty twenty two and twenty twenty one is more or less the same level from twenty twenty. Uh if allow me to I'd like to to to make a link between this uh answer and the result of the company. It is true that in this first half of the year, comparing to the first half of uh last year, we did much better in terms of deliveries, in terms of results. The numbers speak by themselves. But if you look at the the guide the guides for the for the entire year, you see that uh no, as planet, we won't see a huge increase in volumes in the in the commercial or or executive. Yes, we are seeing some some growth, moderate growth this year compared to to the last year. But the improvements in the results, I mean either uh the the EBIT coming from almost minus three percent last year to something between three and four percent this year, or the free cash flow from minus nine hundred million last year to something between minus one hundred fifty and zero this year, all this good performance is is came from efficiency gains, pure efficiency gains. We really did a good right size in the organization. We are improving uh uh I mean a lot of activities on cost reduction, on inventory reduction uh in all the company, you know, I mean pushing uh sales for the future. So again, I mean from next year on, I mean we we expect that uh we with the with the with the stronger growth in the in the in the volumes, in all the the business units, and with this uh more efficient and agile company then we see uh much better performance. So that's why our result uh is coming from this year, from efficient gains, from some additional sales of course, but mailing from efficiency gains. And just to complete in the question for supply chain issues, huh? What we are putting the guidance in what we agreed with our customers for this year. At least for the commercial version having not seen any supplier chain I would say problems this year. We have uh several other questions, so the next one is related to margins and free cash flow. So the question is how do we see margins per business in the long term? And uh and what sort of free cash flow conversion? Ibidai into free cash flow conversion. So I in regards to margin, we do see uh let's in a long term perspective, we do see service and support double digit as it is today. We do see executive in the sense single higher digit, and we we are more or less today. And we do see the the commercial aviation. I would say mid single digit close between three to five percent in the long term. That's what we see in regards to profitability for the company and in regards to the cash the conversion from a bit that you uh I would prefer to talk we are seeing today a fifty percent conversion from a bit to cash flow. We still needed to improve something, but it's more or less the metrics I'm using internally, we do see today in the long run fifty percent of their B IT being converted into cash for the years to come. So the next question is uh from JP Morgan, Marcello Mootta. Any update on the sales campaigns for commercial aviation? Could we see more orders during the second quarter? announced this uh sales for for skywest with uh sixteen aircraft and uh yes we uh we have more to come by the way the skywest it's not part of the backlogging Q2 now we are going to book these seventy aircrafts in Q three. Seventeen aircraft, correct. Thank you, Antonio. There is a question here from Lucas uh from Santander uh talking about you know inflation. Can you please comment on how the company seeing the raw material inflation and how is the company offsetting this impact? uh we do see in our final products inflation I would say all index we have with our suppliers between two to three percent for next year and to to the customer side. We have also the the re adjustment clause with the index I would say. Our uh takeaway for next year is a balance between what we have internally inflation and the pass-through to the customer base. That's more or less what we are seeing. But there is in some indicators a spike in deflation in the index for next year that we we are going to discuss with our customer base. Moreover, we do have we did this year and we are doing this year and with that we do have also a lot of design to value activities inside Empire to reduce the base of the costs we have today, without any impactful any inflation or indicators. Very good. So now moving to new projects. There is a question from Rio Verde Investimentos. Any update That was a good question. Well this front is also moving very well, especially with uh with the most uh uh with the recent interest of uh US airlines in that product. So we we see that product as a as a good alternative for for that market and other markets as well and also as a preparation for for new technology in the future. So we are we are very optimistic and working hard to you know to to accelerate this uh partnership front. Okay, um I think we have at least one final question. It's back to commercial aviation. What do you expect it it's from a WTS? What do you expect in the mid to long term in commercial aviation as we are seeing recovering demand for flights and also renewal for having more sustainable fleets. Uh again we have uh no I mean globally ninety four percent of the Embor Air Fleet back in the skies. In the US I mean uh ninety seven percent of the Embor Air Fleet is is is flying again. So it shows that the the recovery in the domestic market really is coming and that's why we are we are working in very in very uh sales can a lot of sales campaigns in that segment for E ones and uh E twos as well. So we we we are working hard to take advantage of this moment. As Antonio mentioned that we see volumes growing, I mean in two thousand twenty, but uh s strongly from two thousand uh two thousand twenty two but strongly from two thousand twenty three onwards. Um I think a final question uh it's related to defense. Can you please comment on the expectations for new KC three hundred ninety orders? Well it's uh uh as I said in the in the opening we are working in the in many in many sales campaigns for for important sales campaigns for the K C twenty and also I mean we are working in the to develop partnerships that will help us to open uh new markets for that great uh aircraft. Uh I think that that's what we had on the QA. Um so I think uh that concludes the QA. Uh I wanna thank you all for for the questions and the time. So now uh Antonio Francisco no comes. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. So thanks for for for your interest in supporting our company. We are living a really special moment. As I said before, this year is the year of uh recovery, the year of turnaround and of Embraer and the numbers as I said before speak by themselves. We expect uh to have uh a much better year in twenty twenty one compared to the to the last year, coming from a very tough crisis, as you know, and we hope to no we expect to capture the new Embraer uh potential from to grow from twenty twenty two onwards. So thank you very much for your support. quarter twenty twenty one financial results presentation. Thank you very much for your participation."

I'm pleased to welcome you to Arco's second quarter two thousand and twenty one conference call. With me on the call today, we have Arco CEO Waridusacabo Cancineto and Arco CEO. During today's presentation, our executives will make forwardlooking statements. Both known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our action result to differ materially from those contemplated by these forwarding statements. Forwardlooking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to, statements related to our business and financial performance, our expectations and guidance for future periods, our expectations regarding strategic product initiatives and their related benefits, and our expectations regarding the market. These risks include those set forth in the documents that we issued earlier today, as well as those more fully described in our findings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward looking statements in this presentation are based on the information available to us as of the day hereof. You should not rely on them as prediction of future events and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements except as required by law. In addition, management may reference non-IFRS financial measures on this call. The non-IFRS financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure in our press release. Please note that except from revenue, gross margin, selling expense, GNA, and cash flow from operations, all other financial measures we discuss here are non-IFRS, and growth rates are compared to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise stated. We also note that year-over-ear comparisons are affected by acquisitions that were not included in our 2020 financials. Let me now turn the call over to Ari, our co-CEO. Thank you, Karina, and thanks everyone for joining today's conference call. We hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. We would like to present four topics today, as shown in slide three. First, on the results, we had a twenty one point nine percent revenue recognition in the quarter, leading to a net revenue of five hundred and eighty eight million reais for the first six months of 2021, or a 18% increase versus the same period of 2020. Adjusted Ebidah this quarter was impacted by lower revenue recognition, product development, and sales force increase as we prepare for a post pandemic recovery, leading to an accumulated adjusted EPDA margin for the first six months of the year of thirty two point four percent. Despite an even softer third quarter had followed in historical seasonality trends, as Oltero will show in a few minutes, we are confident that the fourth quarter will lead us to meet the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of thirty five point five percent and thirty seven point five percent range. The free cash flow improved this quarter as we collected the receivables generated by the extension of the payment terms to assist our partner schools, taking us back to our strong cash generation profile. Second, the commercial cycle for twenty twenty two school year continues to show encouraging results as pandemic related restrictions are progressively lifted. At this point, we see organic growth pace for core solutions in line with pre pandemic levels, while supplemental solutions accelerate versus twenty twenty, but indicate a two step recovery to pre pandemic growth rate levels. We are achieving great results from our cross cell initiatives, which will now be powered by the creation of a centralized supplemental business unit called Arco Plus. Third, as we continue to search for innovative ways of better service our clients and consolidate our leadership position in the industry, we launched this year SAS Adapt, a customizable and data oriented version of SAS, our most premium core solution, allowing us to better serve the premium segment. SASADAPT was developed on top of Educos LMS, a solution we acquired in July that will integrate our Arcotec portfolio and has great data analytics capabilities. And finally, we concluded our first step towards disclosure improvement and commitment to increase our impact with the release of our first ESG report. I will now turn the call to Oteru to discuss the results for the quarter. Otheru, please go ahead. Thank you, Adi, and good evening everyone. Thank you for our time. I also hope that you are all safe and healthy. Moving to slide five, net revenues for the second quarter of twenty twenty one were two hundred and fifty six million reis, representing a nine percent year over year growth and twenty one point nine percent of revenue recognition below the historical average for the quarter, impacted by the second wave of COVID nineteen. As a result, net revenues for the six months of twenty twenty one totaled five hundred and eighty eight million reais, eighteen percent above the same period for last year. Lower revenues added to higher costs related to product development and higher selling expenses, aiming a stronger sales cycle, led to an adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of seventy two point three million reais, twenty eight percent below the second quarter last year, with a twenty eight point two percent EBIDA margin. Adjusted EBIDA for the first six months of the year totaled one hundred ninety point six million reals, resulting in a thirty two point four percent accumulated margin. Finally, adjusted net income was thirty six point four million for the quarter with a fourteen point two percent net margin and ninety seven point five million for the first six months with sixteen point six percent margin. On slide six we present a breakdown for our receivables, which reduced nineteen percent from the first quarter level as we collected the receivables from our partner schools to whom we provided support through more flexible payment terms. That added to the lower effective tax rate resulting from the corporate restructuring led to a significant improvement in the free cash flow this quarter. On slide seven, we present an update on our ongoing corporate restructuring, which will further contribute to our cash generation in the future. We concluded the incorporation of SaaS subsidiaries on july first, leading to annual savings amounting to thirty million reais. Next steps include incorporation of navia vela this year and escolhe movimento pl,eno and estudos in two thousand twenty two. As we incorporate businesses acquired in the past, we'll be able to capture additional tax benefits and further reduce our effective tax rate. To conclude this session, moving to slide eight, we would like to take the opportunity to make a quick recap on the seasonality of our business and how we expect this year to behave when compared to historical trends. Adjusted BDA and cash flow from operating activities have different behaviors along the year, as we can see in the two in the two charts. The blue line for both charts represent the historical trend, while the red line represents the expected behavior for twenty twenty one. When analyzing adjuster BidA, best performing quarter for revenue recognition is Q4 when all solutions have their first content delivery to schools. On the other hand, the worst performing quarter is Q3, as most of the content has been delivered in previous quarters. This year we expect a more accentuated seasonality, but still following historical trends. When analyzing cash flow from operating activities, as the majority of schools pay for our solutions in up to eight installments starting around February. Q two is usually the strongest cash generator, while Q four is the weakest. This year, as we extended payment terms to assist our partners calls, the cash collection behavior will be a little different from historical trends. Moving to slide ten, we are very excited about the return of in-person classes in most states in Brazil, as it increases the effectiveness of our commercial activities. At this point, fifty six percent of the population received at least the first dose of the COVID nineteen vaccine, and twenty four percent are fully vaccinated, with vaccination of teenagers starting this month in some states. The reopening of schools and vaccination of the population has a direct impact in the commercial cycle, as principals become more optimistic and open to meet our team and discuss positive changes to their schools. As represent in slide eleven, despite in a still early stage, the commercial cycle for the twenty twenty two school year is presenting a much faster organic growth pace versus last year, indicating that the worst is definitely behind us. For our car solution, year to date organic growth pace is in line with pre-pandemic levels, indicating a strong lead conversion on top of a suppressed demand. Positivo is the leading performer for the core segment, two times ahead of the commercial cycle for two thousand twenty school, proving the effectiveness of our acquire and improve strategy. As for our supplemental solutions, year-to-date organic growth pace shows strong rec recovery versus last year, but indicates a two-step recovery to pre-pandemic growth rate levels. We had one of the best years for renewals last year, and at this point renewal rates for car solutions are in line with historical levels, while supplemental solutions are presenting a stronger renewal performance. Moving to slide twelve, CrossL has further accelerated and now represents eighty five percent of the intake for supplemental solutions year to date. Important to mention that the economics for Cross cell are better as we see a faster lead conversion, signing of larger contracts and usually with longer terms. And the relationship with the partners' code becomes stronger, increasing the rotation rates. Possibilities to capture cross-cell opportunities are numerous, and here are some recent examples. In the first one, named Cross Cell Intake, we signed with a large school that did not use any R code product before, adding both PSI and NAVE, our maker solution. In the second example, named Renewal Core plus Cross Cell Supplemental, we extended the contract term with positivo partners call to five years and added pleno. In the third example, named Upselling Supplemental plus Cross Sale Core, we extended the contract term with an international school Partner School while adding other branches of the same chain and including SAS, leading to a five times ACV increase. Finally, in the fourth example, named Renewal Supplemental plus Cross Cell, we extended the contract term with Aniscolate Intelligents Partners School to four years and added the first time. Moving to slide thirteen, we are now powering the cross cell initiatives with the creation of Arco Plus, a business unit that will centralize our supplemental solutions. This structure will allow us to extract synergies by centralizing activities that will lead to cost savings, reducing time spent with repeated demands and challenges is While of course maintaining strong brands, pedagogical approach with clear identities, fast response to customer needs and focus on quality and innovation. I'll now turn the call back to Ari. Ari, please go ahead. Thank you, Oteru. Innovation has always been part of our DNA, especially when it translates into delivering a better product or service to our clients. On slide fifteen we present SaaS Adapt, a version of SaaS, our most premium brand, that offers more customization possibilities, generates more data on students' engagement and pedagogical gaps, and allows for higher connectivity among all content available in the platform. It's a solution that fits well with the demands of school segments that want to customize their content, which in turn will provide valuable feedback that will guide us to further improve our solutions. SAS Adapt was created using Studos and Educos features, which are now part of Arcotech, alongside Escola em Movimento, our App Communication Solution, and WPENSAG, our ERP solution, as presented on slide 16. Arcotech was recently created with the goal of centralizing the technology backbone of our solutions, gathering the best features from all platforms acquired along the years that can be the common tool into one single strong backbone. It will allow for us cost savings and better user experience as we will be able to implement improvements and add new features much faster besides strengthening our employer blind branding to attract talents on the technology segment. Educo acquired in July is a great complement to Arcotex portfolio as it is a powerful LMS that provides a personalized learning experience and helps schools to acquire more students based on data intelligence. On our final slide on page eighteen, we bring a summary of our ESG report released last week. Our first step towards mapping our strengths and gaps so we can further expand our impact on Brazilian education. The materiality analysis presented last quarter guided us. The report brings relevant information on each of these topics and challenges us to continue pursuing better practice going forward. ARCO is undergoing relevant changes. MA was key to support our mission to scale quality education across Brazil. And now is the time for us to organize our structure and further extract the benefits of having reputable brands, quality solutions, and a highly talented team. The creation of Arco Tech and Arco Plus allow us to centralize a structure that will generate even more value when combined. And there is more to come as we deep dive into our processes, generating savings that will translate into freeing capital to invest in what really creates value, serving well our clients and unlocking value to grow. Thank you for your time, operator. We can now open for questions. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press star one on your touchstone phone. Edit this or anytime. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing Start 2. Questions you'll be taking in the order they are received. We do ask that when you pose your questions, that you pick up your headset to provide an optimal sound quality. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Vitor Tonita, the Goldman Sachs. Hello, good evening all and thanks for taking our questions. Two questions on our side. The first one is on Arco Plus. If you could give us some more details on the type of activity that will be centralized, particularly if you will have a single commercial team for all brands now, and if so, if you see any risks through brand perception in using the same team for higher end and lower end supplemental brands. And the second question would be on Arcotech, especially how it will interact with the various core brands other than SAS adds or how separate the technological back end currently is between different core brands and if there could be significant cost savings from arising from unifying the technology the technology backbone across core brands. Thank you hi Vitor. Thanks for the question, Vito Teru here. Um uh on Arco Plus I would say that there's no changing mindset here. I think that's something that uh uh we always mapped that was gonna happen. We were just waiting for at the right timing uh to do uh such um integration. So the idea here is really to join uh efforts in a more uh efficient way across uh those brands. Okay, so in terms of what is gonna be centralized and integrated, uh we uh here internally are saying that everything that is behind the curtain, right? So everything that uh will not prevent uh the client from uh perceiving the uh unique identity of the brand. Okay, so uh uh everything related to uh operations and back office uh uh uh services will at first uh be in integrated. Um with regards to the sales team, the idea here is to keep them independent, right? So as we discussed in the presentation, we already have a team dedicated to the cross cell. So this team uh dedicated to cross cell is already selling all brands, but we're gonna keep independent sales teams for each of the brands as well. Right. So this is what uh uh will drive clients and customers to perceive the uniqueness of each of the brands. But behind the curtains we will integrate uh uh uh uh uh several areas. Okay. Um as to uh arco tech I would say that similarly to our Arco Plus uh here there's no change in mindset as well. Right. So it's really about finding the right timing uh to do it. As you know we made several acquisitions uh over the last uh two, three years and the key priority uh at first was really to improve the content, to improve the product, to improve the customer service, uh uh and to improve the go to market strategy and to use the t the local technology at first, right? So that was the the strategy uh for those uh acquisitions uh that we made. Now we think it's the it's the time to uh drive the integration of the technology platforms. So what we're gonna do is create uh one single technology backbone, right? Uh backing those uh platforms and the front end is gonna be independent, right? So we're gonna have a local team at each of the brands uh driving the uniqueness of the front end uh to students and uh to school, but we're gonna have the centralized backbone uh uh driven by Arcotech, right? So the idea here is to drive more efficiency, uh is to drive more agility, right, and to allocate the best resources possible to all the brands. Right? So so that's the idea here. Our next question comes from Pedro Mariani with Bank of America. Hi guys, good evening. Uh thanks for the opportunity here. Uh I also have two questions. So the first uh if you could just provide an update on the ongoing uh commercial cycle for next year, I mean how you're seeing the new intakes dynamics for the most important ambitious lines, what is the profile of these intakes like if they are coming from proprietors or to the conversion uh to learning systems. Uh that would be uh super helpful, it's the first question. And and the second is regarding the self adapt that you provide us some information right now. I just wanted to understand what is the strategy here, right? So prepare what the schools you want to adapt and if there is any difference in terms of tickets versus the traditional SaaS profits. Okay? These are the two questions. Thank you. Hi Pedro. This is Ari. Thank you for your question. Uh regarding the commercial cycle, uh I'd say that the early signs are very strong. We still are in the beginning of the cycle. Uh most of the contracts are signed in the second semester of the year between September and November. But uh I think the main difference here is that we are now able to visit schools. Uh our team is traveling extensively. We are able to uh receive schools in our headquarters, so we are hosting events uh very frequently and this uh last uh step of the sales cycle to close the deal is very important. So uh we see that uh in core uh we are multiple times ahead of uh twenty twenty and in a growth phase in line of uh twenty nineteen. In the Suplement in 2019 we were growing sixty percent. Uh so I would say that in twenty twenty it's multiple times ahead of uh sorry, in twenty twenty one it's multiple times ahead of twenty twenty. But I would say that the recovery uh to the levels of twenty nineteen it's going to be in in a two step uh uh way. So uh we're very optimistic at this point, still early, uh but uh uh the the traction of the sales force and the sales team uh is very strong. Uh we are very excited uh for the months ahead. Uh regard regarding SAS Adapt, uh I'd say that uh the idea here is m most to address those schools that use textbooks uh and want to have a white label uh product and the ability to flexibilise their content and and also to uh have the possibility uh that their teachers uh produce content and upload in their platform. Uh I would say that uh these are in most of the times a premium schools uh that they have their own content produced in house and regarding the pricing uh it's the same pricing that we use uh as SAS because it's already a premium Super hot for you. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Vinicius Ribeiro with UBS. Hello guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Uh two themes you'd like to discuss here, please. Uh and first t thanks for for the meters on on on the A T V super helpful. Uh you mentioned that core legacy sales are in line with twenty nineteen. We just wanted to clarify if those sales in already include positive performance during twenty nineteen uh or not. Uh and the second question is uh you guys reiterated your your margin guidance and and and uh Ari alluded to to the fourth few results. We just wanted to understand how dependent is this guidance on you achieving your internal goals for the A T V that should st startart be beinging recognized during the for Q and should result in operating leverage. Thanks. I believe it's uh Otaru here. So uh thanks for the questions. Uh as to the first one, uh we are including positivo uh in two thousand and nineteen. Okay. So uh same brands uh grow. Okay. Um uh to the second one uh with regards to uh to the margin, yes, uh we are reaffirming or reiterating uh the the range between thirty five point five and thirty seven point five. Uh I mean internally of course we assume that we will re reach uh the internal uh goals for um for for next year, right? So as I mean traditionally uh we do, right? So uh we are assuming and based on the early signs for uh as Adi said for the commercial cycle they seem achievable.. Right So uh um we brought the expected seasonality for for margins uh this year. So season seasonality will reflect the historical trends, uh uh right. So we should expect uh a a weak adjusted Bida margin in Q three and a strong uh adjusted Ebida margin in Q four. So there should be uh no surprises there. Thanks a fair super clear. No thank, you. Our next question comes from Ian Seskin with Ibanku Bt G Pactual. Good evening, Ari, Dr. Adler and Karina. Uh I have two brief questions here on my side. Uh the first one I I I just wonder if you guys could give us more colour on the uh two stab recovery in the supplemental A C D. Uh I mean uh does it mean that it will take two years to fully recover? Uh should we expect uh these uh supplemental A C V uh uh back to twenty nineteen levels like in the twenty twenty three cycle. Uh that's the first question. And the second question, uh I just wanted to know if you guys could give us a a a breakdown on the non recurring expenses uh uh that you guys published here today. Thank you. Hi yeah, o uh oh Tedu here. So um to to your first point um on the uh supplemental growth, um as Ari mentioned, uh in twenty nineteen this was a business unit that was growing close to uh sixty percent, right? So by saying that we expect this to be a two step recovery, it's not that we don't think that sixty percent growth is no longer achievable, right? It's just because we think that to reach those growth levels we would need to have a full one year of a normal uh commercial activity, which did not happen, right? So uh the truth is that uh our our sales team uh uh was able to more intensively interact with schools from the month of May, uh beginning of June uh onwards, right? Uh and the level of stress at at the schools was uh much higher in in the first semester um of of the year, right? So uh our point here is that we think we would need uh a a full year of a normalized commercial activity to be able to uh reach uh those um growth rates. Okay, so we think that structurally this uh business uh unit is capable of having this growth. Uh and by saying to stage we think that possibly this could happen in twenty twenty three. Let's see. Um as to the non recurring uh expenses, uh could you just repeat the question? You you wanted to understand what is in included in non recurring, right? Yes there there is a line uh uh called the non recurring expenses, but we don't have further details. So I just wonder if you could if you could uh uh break it down for us. That's it. Yeah absolutely. So inside uh noon recurry you basically have costs related to uh the stocks uh implementation um or accreditation um to the company, okay, and you have other uh expenses uh related to uh um MA uh uh deals and the diligence process uh that we are undergoing. Okay. Yes, thank you. Very clear. Thank you guys. Hi, thank you. Uh good evening uh to everybody. Um I wanted to ask you again about the comercialización, I know that it's a little bit early, but I I want to tu to try to to get some color on maybe some new trends, no COVID or affordability maybe impacting the mix for next year, no? I don't know if you if you have noticed any different trends in SaaS, SAE versus the new brands um and and also in the supplemental international school the the old supplemental products versus the new ones no that will be my first question please hi have thank you for your question. So uh we have seen uh when you look at core a strong performance uh for uh all the brands. Uh I you'd highlight that SAS, which is the premium brand, uh is performing quite well uh so far. Uh but I think the the good surprise here is is really positivo, uh where we have uh uh a two times higher uh student intake this year when you compare that to uh last year. Uh and I I think the reason for that is is it it's it's not the the price positioning, it it's mainly the changes and the evolution that we made uh in the product uh and in the technology. Uh I would say that uh it's it's a it has been a good year for uh replacing schools that use textbooks because uh they lack the technology necessary to pursue their activities in the post COVID scenario. But I also would say that especially for the less uh personalized and smaller learning systems that lack the scale to invest it has also been a a a a trend that these schools look for more robust solutions uh like ours. Uh so I would say that technology uh is playing uh a very important role uh in uh shifting uh schools from textbooks and and small learning systems to our solutions. Thanks uh Ari. I remember I remember when you bought Psy that you had a a bump during one year or something like that related with with um some churn, no, related with the change in hands from from the brand. So sounds like this time you're going to be able to avoid that. That that would be really good news. Sho sh should we expect the same for Don Bosco for the ones that are on the antitrust approval. So I'd say that uh we will not be able uh to uh execute a full uh cycle regarding both a retention and uh uh school uh and commercial cycle. Uh both for retention and commercial cycle because the the deal is expected to be approved uh on the fourth quarter. Uh so far uh uh uh because of the the antitrust uh the the limited uh figures uh that we have show us that the the numbers are in line with previous years. Uh but uh definitely uh I think we won't have t enough time to to conclude a full cycle uh in uh COC and Donbosco because the antitrust will be approved on the last quarter of the year. Makes sense. Thank you very much, Shari. Thank you, Javier. Hey guys, it's it's Oteru here. Um we have a question uh from Marilia uh from RSI, uh from the webcast. So uh can you provide more color on Misalva prospects? How does student growth look like and what are the opportunities identified for the D to C uh product? So Maria, thanks very much for uh for for the question. So uh we are super excited uh with Missalva. I think strategically this was a movement that uh uh we had been talking about uh uh for a while. Uh we wanted uh to ha have the possibility to serve uh students um enrolled in in public schools, right? So uh uh we wanted to impact those students but it was very challenging to to find the right d to find uh the right uh product, right? And to find equilibrium uh between what would be affordable uh for those students and the acquisition cost of uh those students since uh those are uh traditionally digital uh products. So Missalva is is a great set uh to this strategy and uh we are conforming uh the thesis more and more as we know better uh the asset. Uh your point on B2C is is is actually uh very interesting because uh this is uh a a possibility, right? So we think that uh the products offered uh by Missalva and the profile of tutoring that uh they offer um is highly capable of adding incremental value uh to the schools that we uh serve already. Uh we are starting to test uh the appetite uh for this product already in this semester, right? In the second semester of two thousand and twenty one, uh through uh a Freeman uh uh uh uh feature. Um and let's see. I mean we are testing uh uh appetite right now uh and the idea is possibly next year uh upsell uh this product to uh a paid burden. At this time I have no more questions in the queue. That concludes Arco second quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day.",

We also note that year over year comparisons are effected by acquisitions that were not included in our 2020 financials. Let me now turn the call over to Ari, Arco's CO. Thank you Carina and thanks everyone for joining today's conference call. We hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. We would like to present four topics today, as shown in slide three. First, on the results we had a 21.9% revenue recognition in the quarter leading to a net revenue of 588 million reals for the first six months of 2021. We're a 18% increase versus the same period of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter was impacted by lower revenue recognition, product development, and sales force increase as we prepare for a post-pandemic recovery leading to an accumulated adjusted EBITDA margin for the first six months of the year of 22.4%. Despite an even softer third quarter had following historical seasonality trends as Otero will show in a few minutes, we are confident that the fourth quarter will lead us to meet the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 35.5% and 37.7% range. The forecast will improve this quarter as we collect the receivables generated by the extinction of payment terms to assist our partner schools, taking us back to our strong cash iteration profile. Second, the commercial cycle for 2022 school year continues to show encouraging results as pandemic related restriction are progressively lift. At this point, we see organic growth base for core solutions in line with pre-pandemic levels while supplemental solutions accelerate versus 2020 but indicate a two-step recovery to pre-pandemic growth rate levels. We are achieving great results from our across sell initiatives which will now be powered by the creation of a centralized supplemental business unit called Arco Plus. Third, as we continue to search for innovative ways of better service our clients and consolidate our leadership position in the industry we launched this year SAS Adapt, a customizable and data-oriented version of SAS, our most premium core solution, allowing us to better serve the premium back segment. SAS Adapt was developed on top of Educause LMS, a solution we acquired in July that will integrate our Arco tech portfolio and has great data and Linux capabilities. And finally we concluded our first step towards disclosure improvement and commitment to increase our impact with the release of our ESG report. I will now turn the call to Otero to discuss the results for the quarter. Otero, please go ahead. Thank you, Ari. And good evening everyone. Thank you for your time. I also hope that you are all safe and healthy. Moving to slide five, net revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were 256 million reals representing a 9% year over year growth and 21. 9% of revenue recognition below the historical average for the quarter, impacted by the second wave of COVID-19. As a result, net revenues for the sixth month of 2021 totaled 528 million reals, 18% above the same period for last year. Lower revenues added to higher costs related to product development and higher selling expenses. Aiming a stronger sales led to an adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of 72.6 million reals, 20% below the second quarter last year with a 28.2% EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of the year totaled 190. 6 million reals, resulting in a 42.4% accumulated margin. Finally, adjusted net income was 36.4 million for the quarter with a 14.2% net margin and 97.5 million for the first six months with 16.6% margin. On slide six, we present a breakdown for our receivables which re- reduce 19% from the first quarter level as we collected the receivables from our partner schools to whom we provided support through more flexible payment terms. That added to the lower effective tax rate resulting from the corporate restructuring led to a significant improvement in the free cash flow this quarter. On slide seven, we provide an update on our ongoing corporate restructuring which will further contribute to our cash iteration in the future. We concluded incorporation of SAS subsidiaries on July 1st, leading to annual savings amounting to 30 million reals. Next steps include incorporation of Nave a Vela this year and escala em movimento, Plena, and Studos in 2022. As we incorporate businesses acquired in the past, we'll be able to capture additional tax benefits and further reduce our effective tax rate. To conclude this session, moving to slide eight, we'd like to take an opportunity to make a quick recap on the seasonality of our business and how we expect this year to behave when compared to historical trends. Adjusted EBTIDA and cash flow for operating activities have different behaviors along the year as we can see in the two, in the two charts. The blue line for both charts represent the historical trend while the red line represents the expected behavior for 2021. When analyzing Adj. EBITDA, best performing quarter for revenue recognition is Q4 and all solutions have their first content delivered to schools. On the other hand, the worst performing quarter is Q3 as most of the content has been delivered in previous quarters. This year, we expect a more accentuated seasonality but still following historical trends. When analyzing cash flow from operating activities, the majority of schools pay for our solutions in up to eight installments starting around February. Q2 is usually the strongest cash generator while Q4 is the weakest. This year as we extend the payment terms to assist our partner schools, the cash collection behavior will be a little different from historical trends. Moving to slide 10, we are very excited about the return of in-person classes in most states in Brazil as it increases the effectiveness of our commercial activities. At this point, 56% of the population received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 24% are fully vaccinated, with vaccination of teenagers starting this month in some states. The reopening of schools and vaccination of the population has ab- The re-opening of schools and vaccination of the population has a direct impact in the commercial cycle as, principals become more optimistic and open to meet our team and discuss positive changes to their schools. As we present in slide 11, despite in its still early stage, the commercial cycle for the 2022's whole year is presenting a much faster organic growth pace versus last year, indicating that the worst is definitely behind us. For our car solution, here today organic growth pace is in line with pre-pandemic levels, indicating a strong lead conversion on top of a suppressed demand. Positivo is the leading performer for the core segment. Two times ahead for the commercial cycle for 2020's whole year, proving the effectiveness of our acquired and improved strategy. As for our supplemental solutions, here to date organic growth pace shows strong recovery versus last year. That indicate a two step recovery to pre-pandemic growth rate levels. We had one of the best years for renewals last year, and at this point we know rates for car solutions are in line with these growth levels, while supplemental solutions are presenting a stronger renewal performance. Moving to slide 12, cross-sell has further accelerated and now represents 85% of the intake for supplemental solutions here to date. Important to mention that the economics for cross-sell are better as we see a faster lead conversion. Signing of larger contracts and usually with longer terms. And the relationship with the partner's core becomes a stronger increase in the retention rates. The possibilities for capture across opportunities are numerous. And here are some recent examples. In the first one named cross-sell intake, we signed with a large school that did not use any Arco product before adding both SAE and NAVE our maker solution. In the second example named renewal core plus cross-sell supplemental, we extended a contract term with Positivo partner school to five years and added Pleno. In the third example named upselling supplemental plus cross-sell core, we extended a contract term within an international school, partner school, while adding other branches of the same chain and including SAS leading to a five times ACV increase. Finally, in the fourth example named renewal supplemental plus cross-sell, we extended the contract term with an Escola da Inteligencia partner school to four years and added SAE, PES and Pleno leading to a 10 times ACV increase. Moving to slide 13, we are now powering the cross-sell initiatives with the creation of ArcoPlus, a business unit that will centralize our supplemental solutions. This structure will allow us to extract synergies by centralizing activities that will lead to cost savings, reducing time spent with repetitive demands and challenges, is simulating cooperation between solutions, providing access to tools and resources from one to another. And leveraging on Arco's employer branding, while of course maintaining strong brands, pedagogical approach with clear identities, fast response to customer needs, and focus on quality and innovation. I'll now turn the call back to Ari, Ari, please go ahead. Thank you Otero. Innovation has always been part of our DNA, especially when it translates into delivering a better product or service to our clients. On slide 15, we present SAS Adapt a version of SAS, our most premium brand that offers more customization possibilities, generates more data on students' engagement in pedagogical gaps and allows for higher connectivity among all content available in the platform. It's a solution that fits well with the demands of school segments that want to customize their content, which in turn will provide valuable feedback that will guide us to further improve our solutions. SAS Adapt was created using Studos and Eduqo's features which are now part of ArcoTech alongside Escola Em Movimento, our app communication solution, and WPensar, our ERP solution, as presented on slide 16. ArcoTech was recently created with a goal of centralizing the technology backbone of our solutions, gathering the best features from all platforms acquired along the years, that can be the common to all into one single strong backbone. It will allow for us cost savings and better user experience as we will be able to implement improvements and add new features much faster. Besides strengthening our employer br- branding, to attract talents on the technology segment, Eduqo, acquired in July, is a great complement to ArcoTech's portfolio, as it is a powerful LMS that provides a personalized learning experience and help schools to acquire more students based on data intelligence. On our final slide on page 18, we bring a summary of our ESG report released last week, our first step towards mapping our strengths and gaps so we can further expand our impact on Brazilian education. The materiality analysis presented last quarter guided us to focus on three main topics which are fully aligned with our strategy, impact on education, focus on people and strong and sustainable structure. The report brings relevant information on each of these topics and challenges us to continue pursuing better practice going forward. Arco is undergoing relevant changes. M&A was key to support our mission to scale quality education across Brazil. And now is the time for us to organize our structure and further extract the benefits of having reputable brands quality solution in a highly talented team. The creation of ArcoTech and ArcoPlus allow us to centralize a structure that will generate even more value when combined. And there's more to come as we deep dive into our processes generating savings that will translate into freeing capital to invest in what really creates value serving well our clients in unlocking value to grow. Thank you for your time operator, we can now open for questions. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press star one on your touch tone phone. And these are any time. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two. Questions will be taking the order of your seat. We do ask that when you post our questions that you pick up your headset to provide an optimal sound quality. Please hold while we pull for questions. Our first question comes from Vitor Tomita, the Goldman Sachs. Hello, good evening all and thanks for taking our questions. Two questions on our side. The first one is on ArcoPlus, if you could give us some more details on the type of activity that will be centralized, particularly if you will have a single commercial team for all brands now. And if so, if you see any risks to brand perception in using the same key for higher end and lower end supplemental brands, and the second question would be on ArcoTech, especially how it will interact with the various core brands other than SAS Adapt, or how separates the technological back end currently used between different core brands. And if there could be significant cost savings arising from unifying the technology, the technology backbone across core brands. Thank you. Hi, Vitor, uh, thanks for the question, it's Otero here. Um, on ArcoPlus, I would say that there's no change in mindset here. I think that's something that uh, we always mapped, that was going to happen, we were just waiting for the right timing uh, to do uh, such um, integration. So the idea here is ready to join uh, efforts in a more uh, efficient way across uh, those brands. Okay, so in terms of what is gonna be centralized and integrated, uh, we here internally, you're saying that everything that is behind the curtain, right, so everything that uh, will not prevent uh, the client from uh, perceiving the uh, unique identity of the brand. Okay, so uh, everything related to operations and back office uh, services will at first uh, be integrated. Um, with regards to the sales team, the idea here is to keep them independent. Right. So as we discussed in the presentation, we already have a team dedicated to the cross-sell. So this team uh, dedicated to cross-sell is already selling all brands, but we're gonna keep the independent sales team for each of the brands as well, right. So this is what uh, will drive clients and customers to perceive the uniqueness of each of the brands, but behind the curtains we will integrate uh, several areas. Okay. Um, as to ArcoTech, our. Um, as to, ah, Arco Tech, I would say that inaudible Arco Plus here, there's no change in mindset as well, right? So it's really about finding the right timing, ah, to do it. As you know, we made several acquisitions, ah, over the last uh, two, three, years. And the key priority, ah, inaudible was really to improve the content, to improve the product, to improve the customer service, ah, ah, and to improve the go-to market strategy, and to use the local technology at first, right? So that was the-the strategy, ah, for those acquisitions, ah, that we made. Now, we think it's the… it's the time to, ah, drive the integration of the technology platforms. So what we're gonna do is create, ah, one single technology backbone, right? Backing those platforms and the front end is gonna be independent, right? So we're gonna have a local team at each of the brands, driving the uniqueness of the front end to students and, ah, to schools. But, we're gonna have this centralized backbone, ah, ah, driven by Arco Tech, right? So the idea here, is to drive more efficiency, uh, to drive more agility, right? And to allocate the best resources possible to all the brands, right? So-so that's the idea here. Very clear, thank you. Our next question comes from Pedro Mariani with Bank of America. Hi guys, good evening. Ah, thanks for the opportunity here. I also have two questions. So, the first, ah, if you could just provide an update on the inaudible commercial cycle for next year, how you're seeing these dynamics for the most important business lines, what is the profile of inaudible coming from proprietors, or through the conversion, ah, to the learn assistance. That would be, uh, super helpful. That was my first question. And the second, is regarding the inaudible that you provided some information right now. I just wanted to understand, what is the strategy here, right? So if the inaudible schools inaudible, and if there is any difference in terms of inaudible versus the traditional inaudible, okay? These are my two questions, thank you. Hi Pedro. This is Ari, thank you for your question. Ah, regarding the commercial cycle, I'd say that the early signs are very strong. We still are in the beginning of the cycle. Ah, most of the contracts are signed in the second semester of the year, between September and November. But, ah, I think the main difference here, is that we're now able to visit schools. Ah, our team is traveling extensively. We are able to, ah, receive schools, you know, at headquarters, so we are hosting events, ah, very frequently. And this last, uh, step of the sales cycle, to close the deal is very important. So, ah, we see that, ah, in core we are multiple times ahead of, ah, 2020 and in a growth space in line of 2019. In the supplemento, ah, in 2019, we were growing 60%, ah, so I would say that in 2020 it's multiple times ahead of… sorry, in 2021 it's multiple times ahead of 2020. But I would say that the recovery, ah, to the liables of 2019, it's going to be in a… in a two step, ah, way. So we are very optimistic, at this point, Too early, but, ah, the, the traction of the sales force and the sales team, ah, is, is very strong. We are very excited for the months ahead. Re-regarding inaudible that, I'd say that, ah, the idea here is mostly to address those schools that use textbooks, ah, and want to have a white label product, and the ability to flexible-ize their content, and also to, ah, have the possibility, ah, that their teachers produce content and upload in their platform. Ah, I would say that, ah, these are in most of the times, ah, premium schools, that they have their own content produced in-house. And regarding the pricing, ah, it's the same pricing that we use, ah, as SAS, because it's already a premium solution. Super helpful Ari, thanks so much. Our next question comes from Vinny Sosebedo with UBS. Hello guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Ah, two things I'd like to discuss here, please. Ah, and first, thanks for, for the inaudible on the inaudible, super helpful. You mentioned the core legacy sales are in line with 2019. I just wanted to clarify, if those sales already include, for the dual performance 2019, or, or not? And the second question is, ah, you guys were inaudible your market guidance and, and Ari alluded to, to the inaudible result. I just to understand how dependent is this guidance on you achieving your internal goals for the ATV, that you start… stopped being recognized during the four Q, and should result in operational average. Thanks. Ari, uh, so just reading to the title here, so, uh, thanks for the question. Uh, as to the first one, uh, we are including for the table in 2019, Okay? So uh, name brands, inaudible okay? Um, to the second one, with regards to, uh, to the margin. Yes, we are reaffirming or reiterating uh, the-the range between 35.5 and 37.5. Uh, I mean, in terms of course, we assume that we will we wait… reach the uh, the internal, uh, goals for um, for-for next year, right? So, I-I mean traditionally, uh, we do. Right? So, uh, you're assuming, and based on the early signs for uh, as Ariit said, for the commercial cycle, they seem achievable. Right? So, uh-um, we brought the expected to the Miami for-for margins of this year. So, season-seasonality will reflect the historical trend. Uh, right? So we should expect a-a weak adjusted bigger margin Q3 and a strong a-adjusted EB margin in Q4. So there should be, uh, no surprises there. Thank you, with that we're clear. No, thank you. Our next question comes from Ian says Ian Sisking with BTG backdrop. Good evening inaudible, uh, I have two brief questions, here on my side. Uh, the first one, I-I just wonder if you guys can give us more color on the uh, justfab recovery, in the supplemental ACV uh, I mean, but uh… inaudible will take two years to fully recover. Uh, should expect these uh, supplemental ACV about 2019 levels, like in the 2023 cycle? Uh… that's the first question. And the second question, uh, I just wanted to know if you guys could give us a-a breakdown on the non recurring expenses. Uh-uh, That you guys published here, today. Thank you. Hi, P-P-Pedro here, so um, to your first point… um, on the… uh, supplemental growth. Um, as Ari mentioned, or in 2019, this was a business unit that was growing close to uh, 60%. Right? So by saying that we expect this to be a two step recovery, is not that we don't think that 60% growth is no longer achievable, right? It's just because, we think that to reach those growth levels, we would need to have a full one year of a normal, uh, commercial activity, which did not happen. Right? So, uh, the truth is that uh, uh, our-our safety, uh-uh was able to more intensively, interact with schools from the month of May, beginning of June o-onwards, right? In the level of stress at-at the schools was uh, much higher in-in the first semester um, of the year, Right? So uh, our point here is that, we think we would need a-a-a full year of normalized commercial activity, to be able to reach uh, those um, growth rates. Okay, so we think that structurally, this uh, business, uh… unit is capable of having this growth. Uh, and by saying to save the things that possibly, this could happen in 2023. Let's see. Um, as to the non recurring uh, expenses. Uh, could you just repeat the question? You- you wanted to understand what is in-included in the recurring right? Yes, there is a line uh, uh called the non recurring expenses, but we don't have further details. So I just wonder if you… if you could break it down for us. That's it. Yeah, absolutely. So inside the recurring, you basically have costs related to uh, the stocks, um… implementation um, or accreditation, um, to the company, okay. And you have other uh, expenses related to uh, um… M and A, uh, uh… deals and due diligence process uh, that we are undergoing. Okay? Yes, thank you very clear. Thank you guys. The next question comes from Haviar Martinez from inaudible Company. Hi. Thank you. inaudible with Morgan Stanley. Hi, thank you. Uh, good evening, uh, to everybody. Um, I wanted to ask you again about the, the commercialization, right? I know that it's a little bit early, but I, I want to, to, to try to, to get some color, or, or maybe some new terrains, no? And to, to understand how COVID or affordability may be impacting a mix for next year. No? I don't know if you, if you have noticed any different trends in size, inaudible, which is the new brands, um, and, and also in the inaudible international school deals inaudible the new ones, no? K, that will be my first question please. I have, yeah, Arid here. Uh, thank you for your question. So, uh, we have seen, uh, when you look at core, uh, strong performance, uh, for, uh, all the brands. Uh, Ayub highlight that inaudible, which is the premium brand, uh, is performing quite well, uh, so far. Uh, but I think that the good surprise here is, is really Positivo, uh, where we have, uh, uh, a two times higher, uh, student intake this year when you compare that to, uh, last year. Uh, and I think the reason for that is, is, it's, it's not the, the price positioning. It's mainly the changes and the evolution that we made, uh, in the product, uh, and in the technology. Uh, I'd say that, uh, it's, it's a, it has been a good year for a replacing school that used textbooks, because, uh, they lack the technology necessary to pursue their activities, uh, in a post- COVID scenario. Uh, but I also say that, uh, especially for the less, uh, uh, proximilized, uh, and smaller learning systems that lack the scale to invest has also been a, a, a trend that these schools look for more robust solution like ours. Uh, so I would say that technology, uh, is playing, uh, a very important role, uh, in, uh, shifting, uh, schools from textbooks and, and small learning systems to our solutions. Uh, thanks, uh, Ari. I do remember, I remember when you bought Sai that you had a, a inaudible in one year or something like that. And inaudible with, with, um, some cure inaudible with the changing hands from, from the inaudible. So something like this time you're going to be able to avoid that, that, that will be really good news. Sh, should we expect the same for the most inaudible for the ones that are, um, under anti trust approval? So, I'd say that, uh, we will not be able, uh, to, uh, execute a full, uh, cycle regarding both a retention and, uh, a school, uh, and commercial cycle. Uh, both for retention and commercial cycle because the, the deal is expected to approved, uh, on the forth quarter. Uh, so far, uh, uh, because of the, the anti trust of the, the limited figures, uh, that we have show us that the, the numbers are in line with previous years. Uh, but, uh, definitely, uh, I think we won't have enough time to, to conclude a full cycle, uh, in, uh, COC and the inaudible school because of the anti trust would be approved on the last quarter of the year. Makes sense. Thank you very much Ari. Thank you, Javier. Hey guys, it's, it's Otero here. Um, we have a question, uh, from Maria, uh, from our site, uh, from the webcast. So, uh, can you provide more color on the inaudible prospects? How does inaudible growth look like, and what are the opportunities identified for the D2C, uh, product? So, Maria thanks very much for, uh, for, for the question. So, uh, we are super excited, uh, with inaudible. I think strategically this was the movement that, uh, we had been talking about uh, uh, for a while. Uh, we wanted, uh, to, uh, have the possibility to serve, uh, students um enrolled in, in public schools, right? So, uh, uh we wanted to impact those students, but it was very challenging to, to find the right, to find, uh, the right, uh, product. Right? And to find equilibrium between what would be affordable, uh, for those students and the acquisition cost of, uh, those students inaudible uh, those are, uh, traditionally digital, uh, products. So, inaudible is, is a great set, uh, to this strategy and, uh, we are conforming, uh, the thesis more and more as we know better, uh, the asset. Uh, your point on D2C is, is, is actually, uh, very interesting because, uh, this is, uh, a possibility. Right? So, we think that, uh, the products offered, uh, by inaudible and the inaudible tutoring that, uh, they offer, um, is highly capable of adding incremental value, uh, to the schools that we, uh, serve already. Uh, we are starting to test, uh, the appetite, uh, for these products already in this semester. Right? In the second semester of 2021. Uh, through, uh, a freeman. Uh, uh, uh, uh, a feature. Um, and let's see, I mean we are testing a, a inaudible now. Uh, and the idea is possibly next year, uh, upsell, uh, this product to, uh, a inaudible. At this time I have no more questions in the queue. That concludes our con, second quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you very much for your participation, and have a nice day.",
      "withCtc" : "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for standing by and welcome to Arco Plataform Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This event ised being record and all participants will be in a listing only mode during the company's presentation. After our core remarks, there will be a question and intercession. At a time further instructions will be given. Should any participants need assistance during this call, please press Star Zero to reach the operator. This event is also being broadcast live via webcast and may be accessed through Arco's website at investor.arco plataform.com where the presentation is also available. Now I will turn the conference over to Karina Carrera, Arco IR Director. Karina, you may begin your presentation. Thank you. I'm pleased to welcome you to Arco's second quarter two thousand and twenty one conference call. With me on the call today, we have Arco CEO Waridusacabo Cancineto and Arco CEO. During today's presentation, our executives will make forwardlooking statements. Both known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our action result to differ materially from those contemplated by these forwarding statements. Forwardlooking statements in this presentation include, but are not limited to, statements related to our business and financial performance, our expectations and guidance for future periods, our expectations regarding strategic product initiatives and their related benefits, and our expectations regarding the market. These risks include those set forth in the documents that we issued earlier today, as well as those more fully described in our findings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward looking statements in this presentation are based on the information available to us as of the day hereof. You should not rely on them as prediction of future events and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements except as required by law. In addition, management may reference non-IFRS financial measures on this call. The non-IFRS financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure in our press release. Please note that except from revenue, gross margin, selling expense, GNA, and cash flow from operations, all other financial measures we discuss here are non-IFRS, and growth rates are compared to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise stated. We also note that year-over-ear comparisons are affected by acquisitions that were not included in our 2020 financials. Let me now turn the call over to Ari, our co-CEO. Thank you, Karina, and thanks everyone for joining today's conference call. We hope that you and your families are all healthy and safe. We would like to present four topics today, as shown in slide three. First, on the results, we had a twenty one point nine percent revenue recognition in the quarter, leading to a net revenue of five hundred and eighty eight million reais for the first six months of 2021, or a 18% increase versus the same period of 2020. Adjusted Ebidah this quarter was impacted by lower revenue recognition, product development, and sales force increase as we prepare for a post pandemic recovery, leading to an accumulated adjusted EPDA margin for the first six months of the year of thirty two point four percent. Despite an even softer third quarter had followed in historical seasonality trends, as Oltero will show in a few minutes, we are confident that the fourth quarter will lead us to meet the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of thirty five point five percent and thirty seven point five percent range. The free cash flow improved this quarter as we collected the receivables generated by the extension of the payment terms to assist our partner schools, taking us back to our strong cash generation profile. Second, the commercial cycle for twenty twenty two school year continues to show encouraging results as pandemic related restrictions are progressively lifted. At this point, we see organic growth pace for core solutions in line with pre pandemic levels, while supplemental solutions accelerate versus twenty twenty, but indicate a two step recovery to pre pandemic growth rate levels. We are achieving great results from our cross cell initiatives, which will now be powered by the creation of a centralized supplemental business unit called Arco Plus. Third, as we continue to search for innovative ways of better service our clients and consolidate our leadership position in the industry, we launched this year SAS Adapt, a customizable and data oriented version of SAS, our most premium core solution, allowing us to better serve the premium segment. SASADAPT was developed on top of Educos LMS, a solution we acquired in July that will integrate our Arcotec portfolio and has great data analytics capabilities. And finally, we concluded our first step towards disclosure improvement and commitment to increase our impact with the release of our first ESG report. I will now turn the call to Oteru to discuss the results for the quarter. Otheru, please go ahead. Thank you, Adi, and good evening everyone. Thank you for our time. I also hope that you are all safe and healthy. Moving to slide five, net revenues for the second quarter of twenty twenty one were two hundred and fifty six million reis, representing a nine percent year over year growth and twenty one point nine percent of revenue recognition below the historical average for the quarter, impacted by the second wave of COVID nineteen. As a result, net revenues for the six months of twenty twenty one totaled five hundred and eighty eight million reais, eighteen percent above the same period for last year. Lower revenues added to higher costs related to product development and higher selling expenses, aiming a stronger sales cycle, led to an adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of seventy two point three million reais, twenty eight percent below the second quarter last year, with a twenty eight point two percent EBIDA margin. Adjusted EBIDA for the first six months of the year totaled one hundred ninety point six million reals, resulting in a thirty two point four percent accumulated margin. Finally, adjusted net income was thirty six point four million for the quarter with a fourteen point two percent net margin and ninety seven point five million for the first six months with sixteen point six percent margin. On slide six we present a breakdown for our receivables, which reduced nineteen percent from the first quarter level as we collected the receivables from our partner schools to whom we provided support through more flexible payment terms. That added to the lower effective tax rate resulting from the corporate restructuring led to a significant improvement in the free cash flow this quarter. On slide seven, we present an update on our ongoing corporate restructuring, which will further contribute to our cash generation in the future. We concluded the incorporation of SaaS subsidiaries on july first, leading to annual savings amounting to thirty million reais. Next steps include incorporation of navia vela this year and escolhe movimento pl,eno and estudos in two thousand twenty two. As we incorporate businesses acquired in the past, we'll be able to capture additional tax benefits and further reduce our effective tax rate. To conclude this session, moving to slide eight, we would like to take the opportunity to make a quick recap on the seasonality of our business and how we expect this year to behave when compared to historical trends. Adjusted BDA and cash flow from operating activities have different behaviors along the year, as we can see in the two in the two charts. The blue line for both charts represent the historical trend, while the red line represents the expected behavior for twenty twenty one. When analyzing adjuster BidA, best performing quarter for revenue recognition is Q4 when all solutions have their first content delivery to schools. On the other hand, the worst performing quarter is Q3, as most of the content has been delivered in previous quarters. This year we expect a more accentuated seasonality, but still following historical trends. When analyzing cash flow from operating activities, as the majority of schools pay for our solutions in up to eight installments starting around February. Q two is usually the strongest cash generator, while Q four is the weakest. This year, as we extended payment terms to assist our partners calls, the cash collection behavior will be a little different from historical trends. Moving to slide ten, we are very excited about the return of in-person classes in most states in Brazil, as it increases the effectiveness of our commercial activities. At this point, fifty six percent of the population received at least the first dose of the COVID nineteen vaccine, and twenty four percent are fully vaccinated, with vaccination of teenagers starting this month in some states. The reopening of schools and vaccination of the population has a direct impact in the commercial cycle, as principals become more optimistic and open to meet our team and discuss positive changes to their schools. As represent in slide eleven, despite in a still early stage, the commercial cycle for the twenty twenty two school year is presenting a much faster organic growth pace versus last year, indicating that the worst is definitely behind us. For our car solution, year to date organic growth pace is in line with pre-pandemic levels, indicating a strong lead conversion on top of a suppressed demand. Positivo is the leading performer for the core segment, two times ahead of the commercial cycle for two thousand twenty school, proving the effectiveness of our acquire and improve strategy. As for our supplemental solutions, year-to-date organic growth pace shows strong rec recovery versus last year, but indicates a two-step recovery to pre-pandemic growth rate levels. We had one of the best years for renewals last year, and at this point renewal rates for car solutions are in line with historical levels, while supplemental solutions are presenting a stronger renewal performance. Moving to slide twelve, CrossL has further accelerated and now represents eighty five percent of the intake for supplemental solutions year to date. Important to mention that the economics for Cross cell are better as we see a faster lead conversion, signing of larger contracts and usually with longer terms. And the relationship with the partners' code becomes stronger, increasing the rotation rates. Possibilities to capture cross-cell opportunities are numerous, and here are some recent examples. In the first one, named Cross Cell Intake, we signed with a large school that did not use any R code product before, adding both PSI and NAVE, our maker solution. In the second example, named Renewal Core plus Cross Cell Supplemental, we extended the contract term with positivo partners call to five years and added pleno. In the third example, named Upselling Supplemental plus Cross Sale Core, we extended the contract term with an international school Partner School while adding other branches of the same chain and including SAS, leading to a five times ACV increase. Finally, in the fourth example, named Renewal Supplemental plus Cross Cell, we extended the contract term with Aniscolate Intelligents Partners School to four years and added the first time. Moving to slide thirteen, we are now powering the cross cell initiatives with the creation of Arco Plus, a business unit that will centralize our supplemental solutions. This structure will allow us to extract synergies by centralizing activities that will lead to cost savings, reducing time spent with repeated demands and challenges is While of course maintaining strong brands, pedagogical approach with clear identities, fast response to customer needs and focus on quality and innovation. I'll now turn the call back to Ari. Ari, please go ahead. Thank you, Oteru. Innovation has always been part of our DNA, especially when it translates into delivering a better product or service to our clients. On slide fifteen we present SaaS Adapt, a version of SaaS, our most premium brand, that offers more customization possibilities, generates more data on students' engagement and pedagogical gaps, and allows for higher connectivity among all content available in the platform. It's a solution that fits well with the demands of school segments that want to customize their content, which in turn will provide valuable feedback that will guide us to further improve our solutions. SAS Adapt was created using Studos and Educos features, which are now part of Arcotech, alongside Escola em Movimento, our App Communication Solution, and WPENSAG, our ERP solution, as presented on slide 16. Arcotech was recently created with the goal of centralizing the technology backbone of our solutions, gathering the best features from all platforms acquired along the years that can be the common tool into one single strong backbone. It will allow for us cost savings and better user experience as we will be able to implement improvements and add new features much faster besides strengthening our employer blind branding to attract talents on the technology segment. Educo acquired in July is a great complement to Arcotex portfolio as it is a powerful LMS that provides a personalized learning experience and helps schools to acquire more students based on data intelligence. On our final slide on page eighteen, we bring a summary of our ESG report released last week. Our first step towards mapping our strengths and gaps so we can further expand our impact on Brazilian education. The materiality analysis presented last quarter guided us. The report brings relevant information on each of these topics and challenges us to continue pursuing better practice going forward. ARCO is undergoing relevant changes. MA was key to support our mission to scale quality education across Brazil. And now is the time for us to organize our structure and further extract the benefits of having reputable brands, quality solutions, and a highly talented team. The creation of Arco Tech and Arco Plus allow us to centralize a structure that will generate even more value when combined. And there is more to come as we deep dive into our processes, generating savings that will translate into freeing capital to invest in what really creates value, serving well our clients and unlocking value to grow. Thank you for your time, operator. We can now open for questions. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press star one on your touchstone phone. Edit this or anytime. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing Start 2. Questions you'll be taking in the order they are received. We do ask that when you pose your questions, that you pick up your headset to provide an optimal sound quality. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Vitor Tonita, the Goldman Sachs. Hello, good evening all and thanks for taking our questions. Two questions on our side. The first one is on Arco Plus. If you could give us some more details on the type of activity that will be centralized, particularly if you will have a single commercial team for all brands now, and if so, if you see any risks through brand perception in using the same team for higher end and lower end supplemental brands. And the second question would be on Arcotech, especially how it will interact with the various core brands other than SAS adds or how separate the technological back end currently is between different core brands and if there could be significant cost savings from arising from unifying the technology the technology backbone across core brands. Thank you hi Vitor. Thanks for the question, Vito Teru here. Um uh on Arco Plus I would say that there's no changing mindset here. I think that's something that uh uh we always mapped that was gonna happen. We were just waiting for at the right timing uh to do uh such um integration. So the idea here is really to join uh efforts in a more uh efficient way across uh those brands. Okay, so in terms of what is gonna be centralized and integrated, uh we uh here internally are saying that everything that is behind the curtain, right? So everything that uh will not prevent uh the client from uh perceiving the uh unique identity of the brand. Okay, so uh uh everything related to uh operations and back office uh uh uh services will at first uh be in integrated. Um with regards to the sales team, the idea here is to keep them independent, right? So as we discussed in the presentation, we already have a team dedicated to the cross cell. So this team uh dedicated to cross cell is already selling all brands, but we're gonna keep independent sales teams for each of the brands as well. Right. So this is what uh uh will drive clients and customers to perceive the uniqueness of each of the brands. But behind the curtains we will integrate uh uh uh uh uh several areas. Okay. Um as to uh arco tech I would say that similarly to our Arco Plus uh here there's no change in mindset as well. Right. So it's really about finding the right timing uh to do it. As you know we made several acquisitions uh over the last uh two, three years and the key priority uh at first was really to improve the content, to improve the product, to improve the customer service, uh uh and to improve the go to market strategy and to use the t the local technology at first, right? So that was the the strategy uh for those uh acquisitions uh that we made. Now we think it's the it's the time to uh drive the integration of the technology platforms. So what we're gonna do is create uh one single technology backbone, right? Uh backing those uh platforms and the front end is gonna be independent, right? So we're gonna have a local team at each of the brands uh driving the uniqueness of the front end uh to students and uh to school, but we're gonna have the centralized backbone uh uh driven by Arcotech, right? So the idea here is to drive more efficiency, uh is to drive more agility, right, and to allocate the best resources possible to all the brands. Right? So so that's the idea here. Our next question comes from Pedro Mariani with Bank of America. Hi guys, good evening. Uh thanks for the opportunity here. Uh I also have two questions. So the first uh if you could just provide an update on the ongoing uh commercial cycle for next year, I mean how you're seeing the new intakes dynamics for the most important ambitious lines, what is the profile of these intakes like if they are coming from proprietors or to the conversion uh to learning systems. Uh that would be uh super helpful, it's the first question. And and the second is regarding the self adapt that you provide us some information right now. I just wanted to understand what is the strategy here, right? So prepare what the schools you want to adapt and if there is any difference in terms of tickets versus the traditional SaaS profits. Okay? These are the two questions. Thank you. Hi Pedro. This is Ari. Thank you for your question. Uh regarding the commercial cycle, uh I'd say that the early signs are very strong. We still are in the beginning of the cycle. Uh most of the contracts are signed in the second semester of the year between September and November. But uh I think the main difference here is that we are now able to visit schools. Uh our team is traveling extensively. We are able to uh receive schools in our headquarters, so we are hosting events uh very frequently and this uh last uh step of the sales cycle to close the deal is very important. So uh we see that uh in core uh we are multiple times ahead of uh twenty twenty and in a growth phase in line of uh twenty nineteen. In the Suplement in 2019 we were growing sixty percent. Uh so I would say that in twenty twenty it's multiple times ahead of uh sorry, in twenty twenty one it's multiple times ahead of twenty twenty. But I would say that the recovery uh to the levels of twenty nineteen it's going to be in in a two step uh uh way. So uh we're very optimistic at this point, still early, uh but uh uh the the traction of the sales force and the sales team uh is very strong. Uh we are very excited uh for the months ahead. Uh regard regarding SAS Adapt, uh I'd say that uh the idea here is m most to address those schools that use textbooks uh and want to have a white label uh product and the ability to flexibilise their content and and also to uh have the possibility uh that their teachers uh produce content and upload in their platform. Uh I would say that uh these are in most of the times a premium schools uh that they have their own content produced in house and regarding the pricing uh it's the same pricing that we use uh as SAS because it's already a premium Super hot for you. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Vinicius Ribeiro with UBS. Hello guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Uh two themes you'd like to discuss here, please. Uh and first t thanks for for the meters on on on the A T V super helpful. Uh you mentioned that core legacy sales are in line with twenty nineteen. We just wanted to clarify if those sales in already include positive performance during twenty nineteen uh or not. Uh and the second question is uh you guys reiterated your your margin guidance and and and uh Ari alluded to to the fourth few results. We just wanted to understand how dependent is this guidance on you achieving your internal goals for the A T V that should st startart be beinging recognized during the for Q and should result in operating leverage. Thanks. I believe it's uh Otaru here. So uh thanks for the questions. Uh as to the first one, uh we are including positivo uh in two thousand and nineteen. Okay. So uh same brands uh grow. Okay. Um uh to the second one uh with regards to uh to the margin, yes, uh we are reaffirming or reiterating uh the the range between thirty five point five and thirty seven point five. Uh I mean internally of course we assume that we will re reach uh the internal uh goals for um for for next year, right? So as I mean traditionally uh we do, right? So uh we are assuming and based on the early signs for uh as Adi said for the commercial cycle they seem achievable.. Right So uh um we brought the expected seasonality for for margins uh this year. So season seasonality will reflect the historical trends, uh uh right. So we should expect uh a a weak adjusted Bida margin in Q three and a strong uh adjusted Ebida margin in Q four. So there should be uh no surprises there. Thanks a fair super clear. No thank, you. Our next question comes from Ian Seskin with Ibanku Bt G Pactual. Good evening, Ari, Dr. Adler and Karina. Uh I have two brief questions here on my side. Uh the first one I I I just wonder if you guys could give us more colour on the uh two stab recovery in the supplemental A C D. Uh I mean uh does it mean that it will take two years to fully recover? Uh should we expect uh these uh supplemental A C V uh uh back to twenty nineteen levels like in the twenty twenty three cycle. Uh that's the first question. And the second question, uh I just wanted to know if you guys could give us a a a breakdown on the non recurring expenses uh uh that you guys published here today. Thank you. Hi yeah, o uh oh Tedu here. So um to to your first point um on the uh supplemental growth, um as Ari mentioned, uh in twenty nineteen this was a business unit that was growing close to uh sixty percent, right? So by saying that we expect this to be a two step recovery, it's not that we don't think that sixty percent growth is no longer achievable, right? It's just because we think that to reach those growth levels we would need to have a full one year of a normal uh commercial activity, which did not happen, right? So uh the truth is that uh our our sales team uh uh was able to more intensively interact with schools from the month of May, uh beginning of June uh onwards, right? Uh and the level of stress at at the schools was uh much higher in in the first semester um of of the year, right? So uh our point here is that we think we would need uh a a full year of a normalized commercial activity to be able to uh reach uh those um growth rates. Okay, so we think that structurally this uh business uh unit is capable of having this growth. Uh and by saying to stage we think that possibly this could happen in twenty twenty three. Let's see. Um as to the non recurring uh expenses, uh could you just repeat the question? You you wanted to understand what is in included in non recurring, right? Yes there there is a line uh uh called the non recurring expenses, but we don't have further details. So I just wonder if you could if you could uh uh break it down for us. That's it. Yeah absolutely. So inside uh noon recurry you basically have costs related to uh the stocks uh implementation um or accreditation um to the company, okay, and you have other uh expenses uh related to uh um MA uh uh deals and the diligence process uh that we are undergoing. Okay. Yes, thank you. Very clear. Thank you guys. Hi, thank you. Uh good evening uh to everybody. Um I wanted to ask you again about the comercialización, I know that it's a little bit early, but I I want to tu to try to to get some color on maybe some new trends, no COVID or affordability maybe impacting the mix for next year, no? I don't know if you if you have noticed any different trends in SaaS, SAE versus the new brands um and and also in the supplemental international school the the old supplemental products versus the new ones no that will be my first question please hi have thank you for your question. So uh we have seen uh when you look at core a strong performance uh for uh all the brands. Uh I you'd highlight that SAS, which is the premium brand, uh is performing quite well uh so far. Uh but I think the the good surprise here is is really positivo, uh where we have uh uh a two times higher uh student intake this year when you compare that to uh last year. Uh and I I think the reason for that is is it it's it's not the the price positioning, it it's mainly the changes and the evolution that we made uh in the product uh and in the technology. Uh I would say that uh it's it's a it has been a good year for uh replacing schools that use textbooks because uh they lack the technology necessary to pursue their activities in the post COVID scenario. But I also would say that especially for the less uh personalized and smaller learning systems that lack the scale to invest it has also been a a a a trend that these schools look for more robust solutions uh like ours. Uh so I would say that technology uh is playing uh a very important role uh in uh shifting uh schools from textbooks and and small learning systems to our solutions. Thanks uh Ari. I remember I remember when you bought Psy that you had a a bump during one year or something like that related with with um some churn, no, related with the change in hands from from the brand. So sounds like this time you're going to be able to avoid that. That that would be really good news. Sho sh should we expect the same for Don Bosco for the ones that are on the antitrust approval. So I'd say that uh we will not be able uh to uh execute a full uh cycle regarding both a retention and uh uh school uh and commercial cycle. Uh both for retention and commercial cycle because the the deal is expected to be approved uh on the fourth quarter. Uh so far uh uh uh because of the the antitrust uh the the limited uh figures uh that we have show us that the the numbers are in line with previous years. Uh but uh definitely uh I think we won't have t enough time to to conclude a full cycle uh in uh COC and Donbosco because the antitrust will be approved on the last quarter of the year. Makes sense. Thank you very much, Shari. Thank you, Javier. Hey guys, it's it's Oteru here. Um we have a question uh from Marilia uh from RSI, uh from the webcast. So uh can you provide more color on Misalva prospects? How does student growth look like and what are the opportunities identified for the D to C uh product? So Maria, thanks very much for uh for for the question. So uh we are super excited uh with Missalva. I think strategically this was a movement that uh uh we had been talking about uh uh for a while. Uh we wanted uh to ha have the possibility to serve uh students um enrolled in in public schools, right? So uh uh we wanted to impact those students but it was very challenging to to find the right d to find uh the right uh product, right? And to find equilibrium uh between what would be affordable uh for those students and the acquisition cost of uh those students since uh those are uh traditionally digital uh products. So Missalva is is a great set uh to this strategy and uh we are conforming uh the thesis more and more as we know better uh the asset. Uh your point on B2C is is is actually uh very interesting because uh this is uh a a possibility, right? So we think that uh the products offered uh by Missalva and the profile of tutoring that uh they offer um is highly capable of adding incremental value uh to the schools that we uh serve already. Uh we are starting to test uh the appetite uh for this product already in this semester, right? In the second semester of two thousand and twenty one, uh through uh a Freeman uh uh uh uh feature. Um and let's see. I mean we are testing uh uh appetite right now uh and the idea is possibly next year uh upsell uh this product to uh a paid burden. At this time I have no more questions in the queue. That concludes Arco second quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day."

      "baseline" : "Good afternoon. Welcome everyone to Brasilagos Q one twenty twenty two results conference call. Today I'm here with Mr. Andre Guilla Moncio and Mr Gustavo Lopez, administrative offices and and investor relations officer. The company's year begins on july first. So that is why we are reporting Q one, the three months that ended on September thirtieth, twenty twenty one. Well, this transmission is being recorded. It is transmitted at our website and also on YouTube, and here we're talking about estimates and declarations concerning the business perspectives of the companies, projections, operational goals based on Andrew. Our presentation. Now I would like to pass the floor to Mr. Andre to begin our presentation. Anna, thank you. Thank you, Gustavo, to all of you who are here in our conference calls. It's a great Even before I arrived I asked the team, gee, where are we going to have our bar? We're raising the bar, the res the results during this quarter would are the same as the ones that we would celebrate as the year's results. So the company is on a new level. We have a better prepared company in terms of real estate and operations. It is a company that is totally different today. So we will begin with the highlights of our quarter and then as usual we will be open to have our QA. Well, those who are sharing, let's begin with the first slide. Okay. The highlights that we bring here for Q one as Anna reminded us very well, this is Q one which began on july first. We had a net revenue of three hundred seventy eight million in this period. We had a net profit of a hundred seven point nine million and an adjusted a bit of one hundred and ninety point six million. The estimate for the harvest that we are ending, the numbers two point six million tons of grains, cotton and sugar cane, one hundred and sixty eight thousand hectares in production. And now we have the excellent news that we gave in the last meetings of the company concerning the General Assembly on october twenty seventh occasion, the approval for a record dividend payment two hundred and sixty million in dividends for the previous year, two point sixty two reais per share. So always bringing to the investor. Last year was a great investment if we consider the appraisal of our shares and also the size of the dividend that we are paying that will represent approximately nine percent this year. Nine percent. Next slide. Well in the highlights in the last call. Or the call before last we said we are vended. We are sellers. We are working on purchases too. In the last call, we're going to do that. the sale of these two farms. I'd like to remind you, last year when we talked about two hundred and sixty million in dividends, they are they are linked to an excellent operational results last year and a small part of this came from the sale of farms, real estate. Here we already have relevant results from the sale of real estate. The first sale is Rio do Meio. Those who have been with us for a short time, this came from the acquisition that we made from Agri Firma. We acquired two farms, Vila Dume and Rojadin, and we're selling a third. This farm has approximately eight thousand hectares and we're selling two thousand eight hundred. We acquired this recently, January twenty twenty, the the value of the transaction. The NAB NAB the this one third of the farm represents the value of the whole acquisition of the farm. So this shows the potential and of value generation that the company has in terms of real estate results. The second sale, the most important sale of the company higher higher volume, five hundred and eighty nine million reais. And also we told the market about a farm that we acquired in the past in tw tw twenty oh six two thousand and six worth ten thousand per hectare and now we're selling at one hundred and fifty, one hundred and sixty thousand per hectare. And I would like to mention two fundamental points for you the sale will be recorded both the first sale Rio Domeo and the second will be recorded in our accounting during the new qu the next quarter and the sale of Al Tutaqwari has a different recording, different posting. We sold two thousand seven hundred hectares and this sale of two thousand seven hundred hectares we will record in two moments. When we deliver, we will deliver one thousand five hundred hectares initially and we will record this part, this result on the fifteen hundred hectares. What will we do with the other twelve hundred hectares? We will continue exploring. It has sugar cane. We will continue until the harvest of twenty twenty three and then we will deliver the second part and then we will record the sale. So this is how we do our Well what I'd like to say here two points. First, the company's capacity to increase its operational area, even being a very efficient company in terms of the sale of real estate. So if we look year after year we have a growth of ten percent of the cultivated area, planted area, and this comes from our own land, leased land, development of land, but shows to you investors, those who follow us, the capacity to increase more and more operational results in an efficient way and in a safe way. The graph also beside you shows the breakdown of the types of crops I'd like to call your attention. Basically in the harvest twenty one-twenty two, we are increasing the cultivated area of winter crop for corn, corn winter crop. Later on we will talk about prices, so we see an optimistic scenario for winter corn. And also more and more maintaining products that have more added value, maintaining the areas with beans. Well, here we have a summary we will grow in production. Here we see twenty twenty one and what we're estimating for twenty twenty two harvest. Soybean an important increase from one hundred and seventy three thousand tons to one hundred ninety six thousand tons. Winter corn, the most important leap some areas were intensifying the planting of corn because of the prices that you are following. So corn, winter crop. Here we see also in other areas in Bahia, for example. And here we see an overlap of winter corn and corn. And here we can continue seeing the numbers. We have the crop. We had some drought in Mato Grosso and in the northeast, so the winter crop has an increase, but it does not refer to the area. It refers to a recovery or maintenance of our uh normal results. When we look year after year when we look total growth in production, we went from two hundred and eighty seven to three hundred and ninety eight thousand tons. Last column. Well, this is a thermometer. This is a new slide. An Apollo prepared this. It's very good to show first on the graph below. Here the the graph below represents the ideal window for planting. This is a picture of the company. We'd like to remind you that this these numbers are from Friday. So we can see here the amount planted. Also another point, we have operations in Mato Grosso. P part of the plant with soybean is in the northeast. It is a window that is different from Matu Grosso and there we are also seeing the results from Shingu. We will continue and we can see here the results soybean, corn, cotton, and beans in the harvest twenty twenty-one-2022. We can also see here twenty twenty one and twenty two almost harvest year in cattle raising. We can see here cattle heads, pasture, and ADG. So beans. We have some of the results already in by you. Next, please. Well, here sugar cane. I would like to say that we have we see a great evolution in the number. You can see here the production in thousands of tons and the number of hectares for sugar cane, then the harvest area and the number of tons. And the actual numbers for sugar cane. Um all open things based up on open books in the old thing. Sugarcane did was not affected by the drought we have irrigation to our agreement with Agrocere, and in the case of the Midwest it is not irrigated, but the risk is much smaller. So when we look at Brazil agro and Brazil in sugar cane. We have almost five hundred and eighty, five hundred and ninety, which is and we see the harvest at the end of now with five hundred and twenty thousand tons the company had a a drop. Here we see the generation of results, bringing a lot of results from real estate sales. So what did we do here? So during a time of spectacular prices we have to max maximize our inventory. We had an inventory of cattle at a low price. ye Larast we had a good strategy to decrease the volume to be more aggressive in sales, generating results. And apart from all of this, we generated spectacular results in the business units when we closed on june thirty and this is a picture now. It's not gonna be two the twenty twenty the twenty twenty we had a G M D, the highest in history. Maybe part of this comes from a lower load. So with less pressure in the pasture land and GMD had again we gained five hundred grams of GMD very similar to the market. We're estimating now the closing with zero seventy. This is what places the company as an excellent producer of sugar cane, excellent producer of beef and other also other crops. Here what I'd like to stress is the company's capacity, resilience of the company to move this to inventory, capture the good prices, and the last bubble, the the last slide shows that cattle raising in the company is being done with a lot of operational results and good techniques. Next slide please. Well here we're talking about the current harvest and here I'd like to repeat this we're always with a good contribution margin, what we expect per hectare. So we have a moral obligation to make progress every time we have a good contribution margin. And depending on the price of sale, we're always looking at contribution margin, the difference of between sale and costs on this date we can see the amount of corn sold at a price of sixty six ninety six. Most of the corn production is winter crop, so here we have a mix of prices between corn in the northeast than in the Midwest. So we have fifty percent of the next harvest. When we look this in comparison with last year fifty reis and now sixty seven reis. At the bottom we see soybean. We're also making progress in soybean. Here we can see the main figures, revenues from operations, when we look at the future and the exchange rate was cinchado closing at five point fifty seven reis per dollar, a little higher than the previous uh previous This will help us with an even more robust result this year because we have prices that are higher than the other. The last line is cotton, where we have progress, an important progress, sixty eight percent in sales in relation. Actually in relation to this harvest, with a price of one hundred and sixty three reais. When we look at the price of the previous, it was at a hundred and eight reais. And you will see we also intensified the area with cotton this year. We had an important increase due to what we can see in terms of margin for cotton. Next slide. Well, here I'd like to pass the floor to Gustavo to talk about the numbers and then we will be back. Thank you, Andre. Good afternoon. Here we're showing the main numbers of the quarter in uh Anna as Anna mentioned and so on and also and twenty junior one october our this is the year until june thirty next year and here what we can see an increase of eighty three percent in net revenue of the company. We see a net profit one hundred seven million reais, forty three percent above last year. And And it's important to stress and the increase in price for corn, soybean, and especially in sugar cane is what is what leveraged all these results. It's important to mention that during this quarter we we harvested almost one million tons of sugar cane for the whole uh and we should expect results that will continue to come in from sugarcane and our expectation is that the price increases will continue leveraging or improving the operational results. When we look at adjusted a bit uh the and this shows the the performance and here we include derivatives as Andre mentioned in the previous page. So we see one hundred and ninety million reis. Last year we had a sale a sale and this year we're expecting for next quarter to To record the sale of Rio de Mayo Farm and part of the second farm, as Andre mentioned. On the next page here, the highlight is the hundred and ninety million reis. We see adjusted a bit here last year. Here we see the price of sugarcane, which almost doubled last year. We had sixty eight rey peres kilogram. Now it's one hundred and thirty, one hundred and thirty five, reminding you that there is an expectation in the market to close at one hundred ninety six, hundred ninety five and we have a premium of twenty percent in the contract with Saint Saint Joseph. The weight of sugarcane this year from sugar cane will be much higher than before. Reminding here in the case of soybean and cotton we're selling the inventory of the harvest that we collected recently. And with prices in soy being forty five percent higher. So we reinforce we're expecting an Ebita that will be very similar to that of june thirtieth last year, but the impact in the price of sugar cane will provoke a significant increase. On the next page, we can see here the company's numbers. We continue with uh a year end report that is stable, strong. We see We see here assets four point one percent. Um also in the company's cash on september thirtieth it had an increase in relation to june thirtieth because we're selling the inventory of soybean and and corn. It's important to say that accounts receivables accounts receivable short term, long term four hundred million reais due to the sale of farms. Here we're including receivables of the new s farms that we sold and we will record in the next quarter. We see also property for investment, the company's farms, one billion reis and we see cash, total indebtedness and and we will see more details on the next phase. Well here we see in terms of short term three hundred twenty five million reais, short term debts, long term three hundred million reais, total six hundred and twenty six million reais, five percent lower than on june thirtieth. Here, one objective we had in the past that we mentioned to you. To have a longer debt two hundred and forty million uh we have for five years and three hundred million reais, which is what we need to plant and the company's operation. So this we are working to renew these uh debts. When we consider the gross debt adjusted adjusted gross debt or net gross debt in net gross debt, we see it's negative, but we expect to make some investments, especially in in compra de facendo in purchasing farms, transformation of areas that we have in the land bank. And we will be very careful with the company's cash. The company's numbers, the company's debt at reasonable levels. Here we have the cost eight point five percent if we consider the future curves and interest rates. On the next page. Here this is we'd like to say that the General Assembly approved the payment of two hundred si andxty million reais in dividends we will pay on the tenth after tomorrow, november tenth after tomorrow. And here I'd like to stress that although we don't have uh a clear dividend policy, uh the objective of the company is To have a dividend yield of five five point three percent. So this is what we will have as a goal. On the next page we we will see net asset value three point two million reis. Here Here this is the cost. These are the numbers. These numbers r re reflect the cost, the value of the property in the company with an internal evaluation lower than that of Deloitte's evaluation. Deloitte had said three point four billion reais. We also always consider our evaluation. We see that the net value of the company four point three, four point four billion reis and with the number of shares forty two point seventy five forty two point seventy five reis per share. So once again we like to talk about the great potential for upside and we invite you to continue to invest in our company. On the next page, the last slide, we see an evolution of the stock market and our share, aggro three on November fourth. Here we show the performance of the company. company to with positive re results. So we believe that our company is excellent opportunity for investments. We thank you for participating and now we will go on to the QA session. If you have a question, please through the webcast in writing, we're receiving the comp the questions here and I will read them. The first question, Carlos Herrera. What is the difference between NAB and price of shares sixty eight percent. Do you see opportunities to r buy back shares? Looking company, huh? Of course, we have an important gap, but we have worked to increase the shareholder base, to increase the free float of the company. I'd like to remind you before the pre follow on we traded one to two million And since the follow on, twenty five to thirty million are being traded every day. We monitor this and when we believe this will make sense, yes, we will approve that through the council of the company, the company's council today. We consider our the evaluation of the properties. It's as if it were worth one point five billion. And we know we have a portfolio of three point four billion. So we are now having the farms that are the cheapest in the Brazilian market. We're we're looking to see if there are opportunities to launch a new program. Maybe not with such high volumes, but we might buy back shares to show to the market the the value of the shares. Also Carlos the resources that we're raising with the sale of farms. How will we use these resources? Will it be used to pay dividends, the sale of farms? Carlos, a good question. It's important to stress that the company in the sale of farms we have a lower cost of capital than the producer. So we can finance the transaction. So in purchases we're more aggressive with cash purchases because we have a cost of capital that makes sense. So I would say to you that first, it's important to stress these sales were made with a duration of two point five in one transaction, two point nine in the other, approximately two point five, two point six. So the revenue from these transactions, I'd like to stress the sale of Takwari was made in two times. It will be recorded in two instances. We should record three hundred and thirty million in during this year and the remainder the five hundred ninety million only in twenty twenty four and the sale of Rio do Meyo should also be recorded during this year but it is also sold in installments. So I joke we we we buy we buy with down payments cash and we sell in installments. This will give us a result. Gustavo showed us how we're showing the results of Q one with higher prices, better results, and different from last year, right, Carlos? Last year we had very few sales of real estate in the company's results. So the company will be aggressive once again due to the results we will have. And I always say with good opportunities we will buy farms without good opportunities or limited opportunities we'll be a we will be aggressive in distributing in We also had a question from Damien in line with the previous question concerning the buy back of shares. So I believe we have already answered now, Vitor Saragiotuk Credit Suisse. Congratulations for the results and many concerns in relation to the price of fertilizer that went up during the last month. So do you have delays in the delivery of fertilizer for this harvest? Oh I I was in Shingu this week. I came back on Saturday. It it's a pity that it's not live. We were there, we went to visit large areas of the region, we were very happy with what we saw. So we had operations left. We went to look And you did not go with me. We're always inviting you to come to go with us to shingle. But going back to your question, we are following the price of fertilizer. I believe it's very important to see the results, how things are happening. The fertilizer industry, phosphate or nitrogen, most of it is born from natural gas. You produce natural gas. I always said this. So you have to produce also from nitrogen urea. And with nitrogen, urea or ammonia and natural gas, y this is the raw material for phosphate based fertilizer. So being frank, we don't believe in a price drop for fertilizers in the next six months. Why six months because we are now at a time of greater consumption of natural gas in the world due to due to the winter in the northern hemisphere. So in December, January we have the highest consumption of natural gas for heating homes. So we have a competitor. This always happens every year. So and now we have very high prices for natural gas. You can see the prices, the the price of natural gas. But in Europe too, the price of natural gas went up two hundred and eight percent in the last six months. So it's fundamental to see this industry in this way. The fertilizer industry on a on a global level has raw materials. I uh I know that many potassium plants will begin producing, phosphate plants will begin producing. And in terms of n nitrogen, we have this great concern with gas, which it has a direct effect. So So the way we see it, Victor, there will be an impact, an important impact for Brazil in terms of the second crop, the winter crop. Same for Brazil agro we're projecting this in our numbers, an important impact for the second crop. For the for for uh the previous one, we have all the fertilizer bought. So we we have a crop with the previous prices, but they will go up. It's important to see when we look at the price of last year, the price of sale for this harvest, we're expecting very positive margins for us. The great question in the market is what will happen in the future from now on. We're looking at fertilizer but also agrochemicals with increases in US currency. We're talking about increases in dollars, ten to fifteen percent depending on the chemical. So it's uh we we have to be careful. There are many consequences for the increase in in of prices in chemicals. Fertilizer is based So this is for the harvest twenty two twenty three we're monitoring. We're already monitoring this, Victor, and I as I always say when we believe that there is something to do we are making decisions. Fertilizers, nothing yet, but agrochemicals, yes. We have already uh we already have a strategy. In in tur in terms of logistics, no problems until now. Gustavo reminded us we put pressure for delivery until now, no problems, no lack of fertilizer. All our fertilizers for this that was planted from October to December is already in in our properties. Winter crop we bought most of it. There is a part in nitrogen to buy. But phosphate, I was looking this week and I said, Why so much fertilizers here. What and they said, No, this is the win fertilizer for the winter crop. We're receiving fertilizer for the winter crop. Well in line with Victor's question, Neri from V T Pacto asked concerning the cost of production. The company's estimates for twenty one twenty two show important increases in the cost for the main crops, please comment on how you expect this will impact the profitability this year and the and now we know the price of commodities is favorable. Do you believe there will be a risk for this harvest or next? I believe Andre has already answered these questions. And the next question, Leonardo Lenka, she's pay investments. First, he says congratulations for the results. Thank you. I believe you have a the harvest for soybean and the winter crop for corn. I believe you have bought the fertilizer. How about the future fertilizer for twenty two, twenty three? Have you bought the fertilizer? What is your vision concerning the fertilizer market? Andre has already answered all these questions from Leonardo. And the next question is I believe that in this question I'd like to say this is it. We have two concerns. We have the sugar cane harvest that begins in April May with nitrogen fertilizers. Our perspective as we said the base industry, the base raw material is natural gas natural gas. We don't believe in a drop in natural gas, especially now with the cold season in the northern hemisphere. The way we see it after winter in the northern hemisphere with more natural gas available at the end of the first semester next year, beginning of the second semester twenty twenty two, we can expect a drop in the price of fertilizer, especially nitrogen. The next question, Flavio Bica. Congratulations for the results. Could you tell us more about rainfall in the various farms? Flavio, thank you for the question. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I would say the following. This year the behavior is much better than last year. You can see you follow us, not only the company but all the market information. Mato Grosso as I said is is finishing the planting. Last year we had a lot of problems in the state of Mato Grosso during the planting season, a lot of complex You you heard me talking about replanting in Mato Grosso, in the press, in the company or even uh in other companies. No one is talking about this this year because it's not happening. The climate is well with a good window, a good distribution, and the good news is that the region in Mapito also Rainfall began a little earlier. We have a lot of soybean planted in Marign, Piauí, Bayatu, things that we know that historically these are regions we have rainfall in Mapito in November and this year already in October. So in terms of Brazil when we talk about the situation, this is it. Now in the long term things are positive. We have a year that is launing And this allows us a good distribution of rainfall in Mapito, within average in the Midwest, and we're always concerned with the south of Brazil. When we talk about the south of Brazil so talking about Brazil agro, our concern this year is Paraguay. Paraguay, we had good rain, but we know that we begin to plant in the and in the end of November. We have good rainfall, but we're always looking at the climate in Paraguay, the rainfall in Paraguay. We reduce the exposure in Paraguay to new areas. Areas where we have coverage, where we have been working for a long time, we will continue, we will continue planting, respecting And planting in a defensive way. But we're concerned with Paraguay and we're also concerned with the south of Brazil and also Argentinians should also be concerned with their climate. In Bolivia the climate is normal. We're beginning we began fifteen de fifteen days ago. The second harvest for soybean, the the winter crop for soybean is more representative than the previous. So we're beginning and the rainfall in Bolivia is within the average in April, May we had a little bit of stress, but now rainfall is normal in Bolivia. There we have a lot of sugar cane. So Flavio, in a nutshell. The company is doing very well, all of Brazil, Midwest and upwards. And we have the a concern with Paraguay and the south of Brazil. The forecast for the year is good in these regions with the exception of the south and Paraguay. The question comes from Walter. Bearing in mind the taxes on dividends, do you intend to anticipate dividends for twenty twenty one tw,enty twenty two? The government intends to charge uh income tax. We have no forecast, but we're looking at the reforms from the government. We're prepared. The company is prepared for this taxation of dividends as the government wants to do. This received a lot of attention when we saw the tax reform being prepared. The company is prepared if this actually happens, if this reduces the profitability of the for the investors. We're looking at the tax reform. Well the next question comes from Adrian Pattinson. Concerning fertilizers and chemicals, how much was spent in twenty twenty one and what is the cost for twenty twenty two? Oh, yeah, you're actually looking functionally. Gustavo, você sente essa vontade também prevention. Looking at each product. Gustavo, help me with the numbers. Now the one passado. Last year we had a cost of production in Soybean two thousand six hundred to two thousand eight hundred depending on the region. This year twenty this year th three thousand two hundred to three thousand four hundred. These are there are different farms regions where you have differences, but this is it. In the case of corn, help me with corn, four thousand, three thousand eight hundred reis. Last year, two thousand eight hundred. Corn has a higher cost, it uses more fertilizer, and it also uses more fertilizers with nitrogen. These were the ones that have the highest price increases. So cotton suffers twice. Now in relation to agrochemicals. In the harvest twenty twenty one, twenty twenty two we had no we had no expressive differences in US dollars. We had problems with the it with the exchange rate. When I mentioned previously an increase ten to fifteen percent in dollars, this is for the harvest twenty twenty two, twenty twenty three. This is a forecast for the next harvest, not this harvest that we're planting now. We're talking about twenty twenty two, twenty twenty three. We're estimating a possible increase in the price of agrochemicals due to many points. Natural gas, environmental restrictions, ocean freight that had high increases. And we know that the chemical molecules in Brazil, the finished products are imported in containers, so ocean freight and this issue of containers, lack of containers that you see. Lack of containers containers that came from China to America for fourteen hundred dollars, now eighteen twenty thousand dollars. So we begin to have important increases. I'm sure that industry will raise their prices for us. As Andre mentioned, in the harvest twenty twenty and twenty twenty one, we had approximately an increase, roughly fifteen to twenty percent in soybean and thirty percent in corn. For the next also Also twenty three, twenty five percent for soybean increase. Why? Because we were able to buy in advance we also made payments when the US currency was around five reis to a dollar. Now we have the winter crop. We We took more time to buy this in. We're expecting an increase of seventy percent in relation to last year. Where are we making this decision? Last year in Shingu we had an expectation of sales thirty five thirty six reis per bag. Today we're selling and in an anticipated way around sixty sixty five reis per bag. So in terms of margin, they are similar or even better than the increase of the price of fertilizer. Also in relation to production costs, a question from Rafael Somer Logos concerning the price of inputs for sugar cane. I will answer this for a found. So last year this year we began to include the cost of leasing in sugarcane. If you purge this effect, which was not considered last year, the increase is weather very similar to the other crops. Thirty percent, around thirty percent. Later on I can give you the juice with But approximately a thousand reais more in the production price of sugar cane due to the leasing, rental of the farms. The next question, Famianu Zankanir. The company does the company have a hedging policy for contribution margin? The hedge is done at cost or you hedge a hundred percent. Fabiano Zankaner. I had a a colleague in Katanduba had the same name. I had a colleague in Ezalk answering you. We do hedging. We're always monitoring the total revenue of the products and the contribution margin. We monitor the cost and revenue. So when the number that we showed fi almost fifty seven percent in soybean, that is not the cost. It's fifty percent of the volume of soybean produced. In the case of corn, fifty six, the expected volume. Cotton w it's the total volume of cotton expected in relation to our budget, the best expectation of productivity. So hedging for us is total volume projected. What is important too, we we have also receivables from farms, which is important for the company. And the receivables from farms are also in bags of soybean. So all the receivables that mature in that year they become part of the P and L of soybean to be sold. The producer can pay us based on soybean. So we consider the receivables from farms of the year in our analysis of derivatives. And this analysis is also done every quarter by Gustavo based on future perspectives of receivables. So answering your question, we look at the number that you saw as a result of the estimate of production and the policy foresees that we will be able to sell up to fifty percent of the harvest when we plant. Then we monitor the evolution of the crop and we can get to eighty percent at the time of harvest. Sale of eighty percent So we're very strict in following this policy. Fabiano said that he is from Catanduva. Thank you. I had a great friend who graduated with me, Rodrigo Zancaner. Some questions concerning the market of land. The price of land. What does the company think in terms of acquisition of new areas, new sales? There is a question from Murilo. Then we have Adair Castro. Questions on the price of land. And we're seeing a growth of almost a hundred percent in the price of land. Do you believe that these higher prices will continue for land? Well, Murilo Adder, first let's talk about how we think about this. We always say that we have to be an anti cyclical company. Whenever it wants to sell, we buy. Whenever it wants to buy So we buy the assets that are ready, the farm that is producing sugar cane or producing soybean They are very similar to what you asked. This area due to the price of increase in commodities, also the price of the case. When you look at the other areas, pasture are areas to be transformed, we also see price increases, but not as strong as the soybean areas. Soybean areas are multiples of the bag of soybean. If it's if a bag of soybean is worth seventy, it's a multiple. If it's worth one hundred and fifty, it's X times one hundred and fifty. That's the first point. So we believe that the price of land will be on a new level because we're not going to talk about soy being worth seventy, eighty. Soybean went and you are s much more smarter than we are. We believe that in the long term we should have soybean around eleven dollars. We're talking about a uh a balance as a result of tax adjustments. But the price should converge to about In terms of acquisition, we're very active. We have spent we have traveled a lot. We have many things in the radar with different difference in relation to three years, but we're also selling at higher numbers than three years ago. We should have an efficient allocation. We are doing everything to guarantee these these this profitability. We have to be very good at buying and transforming the land. And with these these new levels and the size of the land, we should be able to transform land more quickly and be able to guarantee good uh returns for investors. It's an excellent question. Prices have changed for purchase and sale. As I said, we're always buying farms that are not ready, that are not generating this interesting flow with commodities. We always buy land that needs development, needs capex management, human capital to transform these areas. So there will always be opportunities. This is a very large market. We must have discipline, resilience to do what we have done during the last 15 years with a lot of resilience, a lot of discipline. So this is the message we have to all of you. Thank you, Andre. Question from Hernani Sikira, purchase of land, I believe Andre has answered. Now we have two questions from John Wayne and Ed Eric Castro concerning sugar cane. Do you believe that the prices of sugar cane should should continue at high levels due to ethanol for decarbonization. How do you see this scenario? And adders question in relation to sugar cane. He wants a guidance in relation to sugar cane for the next harvest. Whether they will continue at the current levels. Two excellent questions. I'd like to spend all afternoon. First, John. First we have we have a clean energy ethanol not only ethanol as a source to substitute fossil fuels, but ethanol also for hybrid cars. We believe that if we migrate to an auto industry to that wants to decarbonize decarbonisation, we need a matrix that will generate fuel for electric electric cars. So we believe a lot that ethanol becomes fundamental. What I'd like to say too, John Brazil was a country that approved right now in decarbonisation a new program which is Renovabil. It's a government program. Renova Bio is a state program that is here to be another source of revenue for producers of ethanol and to compensate the industry that produces fossil fuels. So I'm sure that ethanol will be more and more relevant. I get sad when I see the world working for a more balanced situation and companies saying, oh now it's w it's better to buy gasoline instead of ethanol. We have to be we have to decide what we want. Do we want less emissions, then ethanol will be important in this industry in the next few years. Edgar's question is very good. Why is it good? Because sugarcane is a crop with annual cycles. It is pluriannual. So the effects that we have in a harvest they continue until the next harvest. So why do I say? they continue We have two large important effects in sugarcane and and Brazilian production. We have the first the intensity of the drought. So we had r rainfall that stopped earlier and we had important results. And a second we had a second when we had severe cold. The drought is known. It hurts, but if n the next year we have rainfall within the average, you can recover. The great problem is that when we have cold weather, when it happened in July, August, we had most of the sugar cane already harvested and planted, which is for the next harvest. So you can imagine the planted used its reserves to and suddenly comes the cold and the it has to begin again. So our experience when this happens for N reasons due to fire or cold or we have an important drop. Because the plant used its energy. So I would say to you, next year two scenarios one optimistic, one pessimistic. And this is not from us, it's not from Andre or Gustavo. This is the pessimistic one is five hundred and thirty million tons and the optimistic five fifty due to these problems with frost and everything. So if you ask me, I believe in a year of favorable prices for sugar cane for Brazilian production, we have to look it's important to look outside Brazil, the production of sugar in India, especially in India, we're having a recovery, a modest recovery in the production of sugar in India. And you can see this with the prices of pound per sugar in New York. I don't remember having seen sugarcane at twenty one cents like we had a few months ago. So the scenario for next year since it's a pluriannual crop, the impact we had this year will continue. Next year we will have low inventories of raw material and that puts pressure on the price during the next year. Well the next question comes from Anthony Gordon, Genagru. As announced in the summit of COP twenty six last year, Brazil signed a treaty, an agreement for deforestation, ending deforestation by twenty thirty. How will this affect our company? Anthony, good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I believe it's important to understand what they proposed. Brazil. I believe uh what Brazil signed is our obligation zero deforestation, illegal deforestation by twenty thirty. This is what they signed. In other words, to zero illegal deforestation in Brazil. We're talking about illegal deforestation. Okay, let's look at let's look at us independent whether it's legal or illegal, we have a few areas in our pipeline to be transformed and all of them are savannah lands being transformed in the Chakho that are being transformed and we have the best expectations to finish this development by twenty twenty five. So the legal deforest deforestation, yes, is what Brazil signed. And every time we see these commitments and they become a reality for companies like ours, companies that have governance, companies that respect the environment, that have management, I believe it's even more decisive for us to take action. One problem in Brazil is that there is illegal, not in agrobusiness, I would say il illegal de deforestation in the Amazon that is illegal. Government areas, Indian reservations. Thank you, Andre. Question from Victor Ponli Talevanti concerning can you talk about the technology projects in the field? How can five G help? We will stay here until tomorrow. So I'll ask Andre to be We have a another question. Victor, excellent question. As Anna said, I love this topic. I will give you some numbers from Imbrappen. Brazil with investments of four thousand five hundred antennas. Today Brazil has a coverage of five G seventy to twenty percent. With four thousand five hundred new antennas, we will take five G coverage to fifty percent of the agricultural land. With fifteen thousand antennas, which is not a very high investment, we take coverage of five G around eighty percent of the areas in production in Brazil. I'll give you a number, I will share with you a number from MROP. This first coverage around fifty percent of the Brazilian agricultural area. That would be fifty s another fifty, sixty billion reais in a from agriculture. If we can take this to eighty percent the estimates, then of course we're talking about technology we can get to numbers upwards of one hundred and ten billion RAIDs generated to add to our GDP. So uh Gustavo and I are leading projects. The company has some units where we have coverage, not all the farm but not only five G also other technologies. Biological connectivity linked to five G innovation of many things, many tools, drones for monitoring, many things that are being done in agrobus and this will represent the new green revolution that agribusiness can bring. The next question, Antonio Siqueira, concerning the measurement of ESG policies in Brazil environment, social and governance. We here in the company we feel at ease to talk about the I will look at the three letters. When we talk about governance, we're the first company in agribusiness to be listed in novo mercado, the elite companies in the stock market. The only one also listed in New York also plus Ideco with more governance. Even the SOX legislation. So when we look inside, we were born this way. It's in our DNA. When you talk about social for being in boundaries, we did a lot of this. We made many investments in social programs. When you take SAP to these regions you have to train people, invest resources and the company has invested a lot in social programs. We created the Brazil Agro Institute, Ana Paulo is the director of the institute. We invest one point five to two percent of our results in projects with focus on education in the regions where we are present. When we talk about the environment, the company had the capacity and the efficiency to manage the assets it had to transform more than one hundred and thirty five thousand hectares. You can see this is linked to conservation preservation. We have we have uh thousands of hectares of protected areas. And this This the environmental these are the actions in the environment to preserve biodiversity. So I would say that agribusiness has everything to lead other sectors in terms of ESG. Andre, Gustavo, and we will see you again in the next quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Anna, thank you, Gustavo, thank you participants who are with us with many questions. We have the greatest number of questions, very good questions, intelligent questions, focused on our business model. Thank you for your attention. Once again, count on our team, team of people. We're showing the result of a team which has been doing good work, committed with the the results of the comedy company, committed with the investors to the investors. We will continue, continue this way, delivering resilient results. Thank you. We wish you a good afternoon.",

      "reference" : "Good afternoon. Welcome everyone to Brasil Argo's 2 \/ 1 \/ 2022 results conference call. Today I'm here Mr Andre Guillaumon, CEO, and Mr Gustavo Lopez, administrative officers and, and investor relations officer. The company's year begins on July 1st, so that is why we are reporting two one the three months that ended on September 30th 2021. Well, this transmission is being recorded. It is transmitting at our website and also on YouTube and here we're talking about estimates and declarations concerning the business perspectives of the company's projections, operational goals based on, on our- Now I would like to pass the floor to Mr Andre to begin our presentation. Ana, thank you. Thank you Gustavo, to all of you who are here in our conference calls. It's a great pleasure to be sharing with you good news. Even before I arrived, I asked the team, Gee, where are we going to have our bar? We're raising the bar at the res- the results during this quarter would, are the same as the ones that we would celebrate as the year's results. So, the company is on a new level. We have a better prepared company in terms of real estate and operations. It is a company that is totally different today. So, we will begin with the highlights of our quarter, and then, as usual, we will be open to have our Q and A. Well, those who are sharing, let's begin with the first line. Okay, the highlights that we bring here for Q1 as Ana reminded us very well, this is Q1 which began on July 1st, we had a net revenue of 378 million in this period. We have a net profit of $107.9 million, and an adjusted inaudible of 190.6 million. The estimate for the harvest that we are ending, the numbers 2.6 million tons of grains, cotton and sugar cane, 168,000 hectares in production, and now we have the excellent news that we gave in the last meetings of the company concerning the general assembly on October 27th, the approval for a record dividend payment. 260 million in dividends for the previous year, 2.62 Reais per share. So, always bringing to the investor. Last year was a great investment if we consider the appraisal of our shares, and also the size of the dividend that we are paying that will represent approximately nine percent this year. Nine percent. Well, in the highlights in the last call, or the call before last, we said, We are, we are sellers. We are working on purchases too. In the last call we already had these two transactions in progress, the negotiations in progress. Entering Q1 we finalized the sale of these two farms. I'd like to remind you, last year when we talk about 260 million in dividends they are, they are linked to an excellent operational result. Last year and a small part of this came from the sale of farms, real estate. Here we already have relevant results from the sale of real estate. The first sale is Rio do Meio. Those who have been with us for a short time, this came from the acquisition that we made from Agritherman. We acquired two farms, Rio do Meio and Arrojadinho, and we're selling a third. This farm has approximately 8,000 hectares and we're selling 2,800. We acquired this recently, January 2020. The, the value of the transaction, the NAB, NAB the, this one third of the farm represents the value of the whole acquisition of the farm. So this shows the potential and a value generation that the company has in terms of real estate results. The second sale, the most important sale of the company, higher, higher volume 580 million Reais, and also we told the market about a farm that we acquired in the past in two- twen- 2006, 2006 worth 10,000 per hectare and now we're selling at 150 \/ 160,000 per hectare. And I would like to mention two fundamental points for you. The sale will be recorded, both the first sale Rio do Meio, and the second will be recorded in our accounting during the new qu- the next quarter, and the same of Alto Taquari has a different recording, different postings. We sold 2,700 hectares, and this sale of 2,700 hectares we will record in two moments. When we deliver, we will deliver 1,500 hectares initially, and we will record this part, this result on the 1,500 hectares. What will we do with the other 1,200 hectares? We will continue exploring. It has sugar cane. We will continue until the harvest of 2023, and then we will deliver the second part. And then we will record the sale. So, this is how we do our accounting. Well, what I'd like to say here, two points. First, the company's capacity to increase its operational area, even being a very efficient company in terms of the sale of real estate. So if we look year after year, we have a growth of 10 percent of the cultivated area, planted area, and this comes from our roll land, leased land, development of land, but shows to you, investors, those who follow us, the capacity to increase more and more operational results in an efficient way and in a safe way. The graph also beside you shows the breakdown of the types of crops. I'd like to call your attention, basically in the harvest 21 \/ 22 we are increasing the cultivated area of winter crop for corn, corn winter crop. Later on we will talk about prices. So we see an optimistic scenario for winter corn. And also, more and more maintaining products that have more added value, maintaining the areas with beans. Well, here we have a summary we will grow in production. Here we see 2021 and what we're estimating for 2022 harvests. Soya bean had an important increase from 173,000 tons to 196,000 tons. Winter corn, the most important leap, some areas were intensifying the planting of corn because of the prices that you are following. So, corn winter crop, here we see also in other areas in Bahia for example, and here we see an overlap of winter corn and corn. And here we can continue seeing the numbers. We have the crop, we have some drought in Mato Grosso and in the North East, so the winter crop has an increase, but it does not refer to the area. It reports to a recovery or maintenance of our er, normal results. When we look year after year, when we look total growth in production we went from 287 to 398,000 tons. Last column. Well, this is a thermometer, this is a new slide, and Appala prepared this, it's very good to show first on the graph below. Here, the graph below represents the ideal window for planting. This is a picture of… the company would like to remind you that this, these numbers are from Friday, so we can see here the amount planted. Also, another point, we have operations in Mato Grosso, part of the plant with soya beans is in the North East. It is a window that is different from Mato Grosso. We are also seeing the results from Xingu too. We will continue. We can see here the result soya bean, corn, cotton and beans in the harvest 2021 \/ 2022. We can also see here 2021 and 22 harvest year in cattle raising. We can see here cattle has pasture and ADG. So, beans we have some of results already in. Well here sugar cane, I would like to say that we have, we see a great evolution in the number. You can see here the production in thousands of tons and the number of hectares for sugar cane, and then the harvest area, and the number of tons. Here we see the difference between the estimate and the actual numbers for sugar cane. Sugar cane did, was not affected by the drought. We have irrigation through our agreement with Agrosa, and in the case of the mid-West it is not irrigated, but the risk is much smaller. So when we look at Brasil Agro in Brazil in sugar cane, we have almost 580 \/ 590 which is, and we see the harvest at the end of, now with 520,000 tons. The company had a, a drop. Here we see the generation of results, bringing a lot of results from real estate sales. So what did we do here? So, during a time of spectacular prices, we have to max, maximize our inventory. We had an inventory of cattle had a low price. Last year we had a good strategy to decrease the volume to be more aggressive in sales, generating results, and apart from all of this, we generated spectacular results in the business unit when we closed on June 30, and this is a picture now. The 2020, the twe- we had a GMD, the highest in history. Maybe part of this comes from a lower load when you- so, with less pressure in the pasture land and GMD had- Again we gained 500 grams of GMD very similar to the mark. We're estimating now the closing with 070. This is what places the company as an excellent producer of sugar cane, excellent produteror- producer of beef and other, also with the crops. Here what I'd like to stress is, the company's capacity, resilience of the company to move this inventory, capture the good prices and the last, inaudible the- the last slide shows that cattle raising in the company is being done with a lot of operational results and good techniques. Well, here we're talking about the current harvest, and here I'd like to repeat this, we're always with a good contribution margin, what we expect per hectare. So we have a moral obligation to make progress every time we have a good contribution margin, and depending on the price of sale we're always looking at contribution margins, the difference of between sale and cost. On this date we can see the amount of corn sold at a price of 66.96. Most of the corn production is winter crop, so here we have a mix of prices between corn in the North-East, then in the mid-West. So we have 50 percent of the next harvest. When we look this in comparison with last year, wi- with the same mix, 50 Reais and now 67 Reais. At the bottom we see soya bean. We're also making progress in soya beans. Here we can see the main figures, revenues from operations when we look at the future and the exchange rate closing at 5.57 Reais per Dollar. At little higher than the previous, previous harvest when we have 5.51 Reais per Dollar. This will help us with an even more robust result this year because we have-… result this year because we have prices that are higher than last year for the grades. The last line is cotton, where we have progress and important progress. 68% in sales in relation to the previous harvest, actually in relation to this harvest, with a price of 163 reais. When we look at the price of the previous, it was at 108 reais. And you will see, we also intensified the area with cotton this year. We had an important increase due what we can see in terms of margin for… inaudible to the next slide. Well, here, I'd like to pass the floor to Gustavo to talk about the numbers and then we will be back. Thank you Andrea. Good afternoon. Well, here, we're showing the main numbers of the quarter, as Anna mentioned, and our… This is the year until June 30 next year. And here, what we can see an increase of 83% in net revenue of the company, we see a net profit, 107 million reais, 43% above last year. And it's important to stress, and the increase in price for corn, soybean and especially in sugar cane, is what leveraged all these results. It's important to mention that during this quarter, we, we harvested almost 1 million tons of sugar cane, and we should expect results that will continue to come in from sugar cane. And our expectation is that the price increases will continue leveraging or improving the operational results. When we look at adjusted EBITDA, and this shows the performance. And here we include derivatives, as Andrea mentioned in the previous page. So we see 190 million reais. Last year, we had a sa- a sale. And this year we're expecting for next quarter, to record the sale of Rio do Mayo farm and part of the second farm, as Andrea mentioned. On the next page, here the highlight is the 190 million reais. We see adjusted EBITDA here, last year. Here, we see the price of sugar cane, which almost doubled. Last year, we had 68 reais per kilogram. Now it's 130, 135, reminding you that there is an expectation in the market to close at 196, 195. And we have a premium of 20% of the contract with Sao, Sao Jose. The weight of sugar gain this year from sugar cane, will be much higher than before. Reminding here in the case of soybean and cotton, we're selling the inventory of the harvest that we collected recently. And with prices in soybean 45% higher. And in the case of corn, 32%. So we reinforce, we're expecting an EBITDA that will be very similar to that of June 30 last year, but the impact in the price of sugar cane will provoke a significant increase. On the next page. We can see here the company's numbers. We continue with a, a year-end report that is stable, strong. We see here assets, 4.1%. Um, also the company's cash on September 30th, it had an increase in relation to June 30 because we're selling the inventory of soybean and, and corn. It's important to say that accounts receivable, accounts receivable short-term, long-term, 400 million reais, due to the sale of farms. Here, we're including receivables of the new se- farms that we sold and we will record in the next quarter. We see also property for investment, the company's farms, 1 billion reais, and we see cash totally indebtedness. And, and we will see more details on the next page. Well, here we see in terms of short term, 325 million reais short-term debt, long-term 300 million reais, total 626 million reais, 5% lower than on June 30th. Here, one objective we had in the past that we mentioned to you to have a longer debt, 240 million, uh, we have for five years, and 300 million reais, which is what we need to plant and the company's operation. So this, we are working to renew these, uh, debts. When we consider the gross debt, adjusted, adjusted gross debt or a net gross debt in net gross debt, we see it's negative. But we expect to make some investments, especially in purchasing farms, transformation of areas that we have in the land bank. And we will be very careful with the company's cash. But during these times of volatility, we know but we're trying instruments to maintain the company's numbers, the company's debt at reasonable levels. Here, we have the cost, 8.5%, if we consider the future curves and interest rates. On the next page, here, this is, we'd like to say that the general assembly approved the payment of 260 million reais in dividends. We will pay on the 10th after tomorrow, November 10th, after tomorrow. And here I'd like to stress that although we don't have a, a clear dividend policy, the objective of the company is to have a dividend yield of 5%, 5.3%. So this is what we will have as a goal. On the next page, we, we will see net asset value, 3.2 million reais. Here, this is the cost. These are the numbers. These numbers re- reflect the cost, the value of the property in the company, with an internal evaluation lower than that of Deloitte's evaluation. Deloitte had said 3.4 billion reais. We also always consider our evaluation. We see that the net value of the company, 4.3, 4.4 billion reais, and with the number of shares, 42.75, 42.75 reais per share. So once again, we'd like to talk about the great potential for upside, and we invite you to continue to invest in our company. On the next page, the last slide, we see an evolution of the stock market and our share, agro 3 on November 4th. Here we show the performance of the company. So this is the market is booming for agrobusiness, and the company too, with positive re- results. So we believe that our company is excellent opportunity for investments. We thank you for participating. And now, we will go on to the Q&A session. Well, reminding you, if you have a question, please, through the webcast in writing, we're receiving the compa- the questions here, and I will read them. The first question, Carlos Herera, What is the difference between NAV and price of shares, 68%? Do you see opportunities to buy back shares? Carlos, looking, of course we have an important gap, but we have worked to increase the shareholder base, to increase the free float of the company. I'd like to remind you, before the pre fall one, we traded 1 to 2 million. And since the fall one, 25 to 30 million are being traded every day. We monitor this. And when we believe this will make sense, yes, we will approve that through the council of the company. The company's council. Today, we consider our, the evaluation of the properties, it's as if it were worth 1.5 billion. And we know we have a portfolio of 3.4 billion. So we are now having the farms that are the cheapest in the Brazilian market. We're, we're looking to see if there are opportunities to launch a new program, maybe not with such high volumes, but we might buy back shares to show to the market the, the value of the shares. Also Carlos, The resources that we're raising with the sale of farms, how will we use these resources? Will it be used to pay dividends, the sale of farms? Carlos, a good question. It's important to stress the company in the sale of farms, we have a lower cost of capital than the producer, so we can finance the transaction. So in purchases, we're more aggressive with, with cash purchases because we have a cost of capital that makes sense. So I would say to you that first, it's important to stress, these sales were made with a duration of 2.5 in one transaction, 2.9 in the other, approximately 2.5, 2.60, the revenue from these transactions, I'd like to stress, the sale of foreign language was made in two terms. It will be recorded in two instances. We should record 330 million in, during this year, and the remainder, the 590 million only in 2024. And the sale of Rio de Mayo should also be recorded during this year, but it is also sold in installments. So I joke we, we, we buy, we buy with down payments cash, and we sell in installments. This will give us a result. Gustav showed us how we're showing the results of Q1 with higher prices, better results, and different from last year, right, Carlos? Last year we had very few sales of real estate in the company's results. So the company will be aggressive once again, due to the results we will have. And I always say, with good opportunities, we will buy farms without good opportunities or limited opportunities will be a, we will be aggressive in distributing in, sell dividends to our shareholders. But we should have an even more robust result than last year. Thank you, Carlos. We also had a question from Damien in line with the previous question concerning the buy-back of shares. So I believe we have already answered. Now Vito foreign language Credit Suisse. He says, Congratulations for the results, and many concerns in relation to the price of fertilizer that went up during the last month. So do you have delays in the delivery of fertilizer for this harvest? Oh, I, I was in Shingu this week. I came back on Saturday. It's a pity that is not live. We were there. We went to visit large areas of the region. We were very happy with what we saw. So we had operations li- we went to look at new areas for acquisitions and you did not go with me. We're always inviting you to come to go with us to Shingu. But going back to your question, we are following the price of fertilizer. I believe it's very important to see the results, how things are happening. The fertilizer industry, phosphate or nitrogen, most of it is born from natural gas. You produce natural gas, I always said this. So you have to produce also from nitrogen, urea. And with nitrogen, urea ammonia and natural gas, this is the raw material for phosphate-based fertilizer. So being frank, we don't believe in a price drop for fertilizers in the next six months. Why six months? Because we are now at a time of greater consumption of natural gas in the world due to, due to the winter in the Northern hemisphere. So in December, January, we have the highest consumption of natural gas for heating homes. So we have a competitor. This always happens every year. So, and now we have very high prices for natural gas. You can see the prices, the, the price of natural gas. But in Europe too, the price of natural gas went up 208% in the last six months. So it's fundamental to see this industry in this way. The fertilizer industry on a, on a global level has… Pfizer industry on a, on a global level has raw materials. I, I know that many potassium plants will begin producing phosphate plants will begin producing. And in terms of nitrogen, we have this great concern with gas, which has a direct effect. So the way we see it Victor, there will be an impact, an important impact for Brazil in terms of the second crop, the winter crop, same for Brazil we're projecting this in our numbers, an important impact for the second crop. For the, for, for the previous one, we have all the fertilizer bots. So we're, we have a crop with the previous prices, but they will go up. It's important to see when we look at the price of last year, the price of sale for this harvest, we're expecting very positive margins for us. The great question in the market is what will happen in the future from now on. We're looking at fertilizer, but also agrochemicals with increases in US currency. We're talking about increases in dollars 10% to 15% depending on the chemical. So it's a, we, we have to be careful, there are many consequences for the increase in, in of prices in chemicals. Fertilizer is based on the increase in the price of natural gas. So this is for the harvest 22, 23 we're monitoring. We're already monitoring this Victor and I, as I always say, when we believe that there is something to do, we are making decisions. Fertilizers, nothing yet, but agrochemicals yes, we have already, uh, we already have a strategy. In, in te- in terms of logistics, no problems until now. Gustavo reminded us, we put pressure for delivery until now no problems, no lack of fertilizer. All our fertilizers for this, that was planted from October to December is already in, in our properties. Winter crop we bought most of it. There is a part in nitrogen to buy but phosphate I was looking this week and I said, Why so much fertilizers here? Why? And they said, No, this is the wi- fertilizer for the winter crop. We are receiving fertilizer for the winter crop. Well, in line with Victor's question, Hey, Reiki from VTG inaudible as concerning the cost of production, the company's estimates for 21 \/ 22 show important increases in the cost for the main crops. Please comment on how you expect this will impact the profitability this year. And the, and now we know the price of commodities is favorable. Do you believe there will be a risk for this harvest or next? I believe Andrea has already answered these questions. And the next question, Leonard Walinkar Shivsi Investments. First, he says, congratulations for the results. Thank you. I believe you have a, the harvest for soybean and the winter crown for corn. I believe you have bought the fertilizer. How about the future fertilizer for 22 \/ 23? Have you bought the fertilizer? What is your vision concerning the fertilizer market? Andrea has already answered all these questions from Leonardo. Then the next question, I believe that in this question, I'd like to say, this is it. We have two concerns, we have the sugar cane harvest that begins in April May with nitrogen fertilizers. Our perspective as we said the base industry, the base raw material is natural gas, natural gas. We don't believe in a drop in natural gas, especially now with the cold season in the Northern hemisphere. The way we see it after winter in the Northern hemisphere with more natural gas available at the end of the first semester next year, beginning of the second semester 2022, we can expect a drop in the price of fertilizer, especially nitrogen and phosphate. The next question, Flavio Bika congratulations for the results. Could you tell us more about rainfall in the various farms? Flavio, thank you for the question. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I would say the following, this year the behavior is much better than last year. You can see you follow us, not only the company, but all the market information Mato Grosso as I said, is, is finishing the planting last year. We had a lot of problems in the state of Mato Grosso during the planting season, a lot of complexity. You, you heard me talking about replanting in Mato Grosso in the press, in the company or even in other companies. No one is talking about this this year because it's not happening. The climate is well with a good window, a good distribution. And the good news is that the region in inaudible also has good rainfall. Rainfall began a little earlier. We have a lot of soybean planted in inaudible by year two things that we know that historically, these are regions we have rainfall in Mapitu in November and this year already in October. So in terms of Brazil, when we talk about the situation, this is it. Now in the long term, things are positive. We have a year that is running and this announces a good distribution of rainfall in Mapitu within average in the Midwest. And we're always concerned with the south of Brazil. When we talk about the south of Brazil, so talking about Brazil, our, our concern this year is Paraguay. Paraguay, we had good rain, but we know that we begin to plant in, and in the end of November we have good rainfall, but we're always looking at the climate in Paraguay, the rainfall in Paraguay. We reduce the exposure in Paraguay to new areas. Areas where we have coverage, where we have been working for a long time, we will continue. We will continue planting, respecting, and planting in a defensive way. But we're concerned with Paraguay and we're also concerned with the south of Brazil and also Argentina should also be concerned with our climate. In Bolivia, the climate is normal, we are beginning, we began 15 d- 15 days ago. The second harvest for soybean the, the winter crop for soybean is more representative than the previous. So we're beginning. And the rainfall in Bolivia is within the average in April, May, we had a little bit of stress but now rainfall is normal in Bolivia. There, we have a lot of sugar cane. So Flavio in a nutshell, the company is doing very well. All of Brazil, Midwest and upwards and we have a, a concern with Paraguay in the south of Brazil. The forecast for the year is good in these regions with the exception of the south and Paraguay. Well the next question comes from Walter. Bearing in mind the taxes on dividends, do you intend to anticipate dividends for 2021 \/ 2022 the government intends to charge income tax. We have no forecast, but we're looking at the reforms from the government. Were prepared, the company is prepared for this taxation of dividends as the government wants to do. This received a lot of attention when we saw the tax reform being prepared, the company is prepared. If this actually happens, if this reduces the profitability of the, for the investors, we're looking at the tax reform. Well the next question comes from Adrian Patinson concerning fertilizers and chemicals. How much was spent in 2021? And what is the cost for 2022? Well, here we, we can talk about percentages without looking at each product. Gustavo help me with the numbers. Now, last year, we had a cost of production in soybean R$ 2,600 to R$ 2,800, depending on the region. This year twe- this year R$ 3,200 to R$ 3,400. These are, there are different farms, regions, where you have differences, but this is it. In the case of corn help me with corn. R$ 4,000, R$ 3,800 last year R$ 2,800. Corn, it has a higher cost, it uses more fertilizer, and it also uses more fertilizers with nitrogen. These were the ones that have the highest price increases. So cotton suffers twice. Now in relation to agrochemicals in the harvest 2021 \/ 2022 we had no, we had no expressive differences in US dollars. We had problems with the, with the exchange rate. When I mentioned previously an increase 10% to 15% in dollars this is for the harvest 2022 \/ 2023. This is a forecast for the next harvest not this harvest that we're planting now. We're talking about 2022 \/ 2023. We're estimating a possible increase in the price of agrochemicals due to many points, natural gas, environmental restrictions, ocean freights that had high increases. And we know that the chemical molecules in Brazil, the finished products are imported in containers. So ocean freight and this issue of containers, lack of containers that you see lack of containers, containers that came from China to America for $1,400 now, $18,000 $20,000. So we begin to have important increases. I'm sure that industry will raise their prices for us. As Andre mentioned in the harvest 2020 and 2021, we had approximately an increase roughly 15% to 20% in soybean and 30% in corn. For the next also 23%, 25% for soybean increase. Why? Because we were able to buy in advance. We also made payments when the US currency was around five Reals to a Dollar. Now we have the winter crop. We, we took more time to buy this in. We're expecting an increase of 70% in relation to last year. Why are we making this decision? Last year in Xingu we had an expectation of sales, R$ 35, R$ 36 per bag. Today we're selling an in an anticipated way around R$ 60 R$ 65 per bag. So in terms of margin, They are similar or even better than the increase of the price of fertilizer. Also in relation to production costs a question from Rafael Summer Logos concerning the price of inputs for sugar cane. A greater price. I will answer this Rafael. So last year, this year, we began to include the cost of leasing in sugar cane. If you purged this effect, which was not considered last year, the increase is whether very similar to the other crops 30% around 30%. Later on, I can give you the details, but approximately a R$ 1,000 more in the production price of sugar cane due to the leasing rental of the farms. The next question, inaudible. The company does the company have a hedging policy for contribution margin? The hedge is done at cost, or you hedge a 100%. Fabiano inaudible. I had a, a colleague in inaudible had the same name. I had a colleague, inaudible answering you. We do hedging, we're always monitoring the total revenue of the product and the contribution margin we monitor the cost and revenue. So when the number that we showed fi- almost 57% in soybean, that is not the cost. It's 50% of the volume of soybean produced in the case of corn, 56%, the expected volume content. It's the total volume of cotton expected in relation to our budget, the best expectation of productivity. So hedging for us is total volume projected. What is important too, we, we have also receivables from farms, which is important for the company. And the receivables from farms are also in bags of soybean. So all the receivables that mature in that year, they become part of the P&L of soybean to be sold. The producer can pay us based on soybean. So we consider the receivables from farms of the year in our analysis of derivatives. And this analysis is also done every quarter by Gustavo based on future perspectives of receivables. So answering your question, we look at the number that you saw as a result of the estimate of production and the policy foresees, that we will be able to sell up to 50% of the harvest when we plant. Then we monitor the evolution of the crop and we can get to 80% at the time of harvest, sale of 80%. So we're very strict in following this policy. Fabiano said that he is from Katalgu. Thank you. I had a great friend who graduated with me, Rodriguez inaudible. Some questions concerning the markets of land, the price of land. What does the company think in terms of acquisition of new areas, new sales? There is a question from inaudible then we have inaudible questions on the price of land. And we're seeing the growth of almost a 100% in the price of land. Do you believe that- In the price of land. Do you believe that these higher prices will continue for land? Well inaudible first let's talk about how we think about this. We always say that we have to be an anti-cyclical company When everyone wants to sell, we buy. When everyone wants to buy, we… When everyone wants to sell, we buy. So we buy the assets that are ready, the farm that is producing sugar cane, or producing soybeans. They are, they are very similar to what you asked. This area, due to the price of increase in commodities, also the price of land. When you look at the areas, pasture a-areas to be transformed, we also see price increase, but no as strong as the soybean areas. Soybeans area are multiples of the bag of soybeans. If it's, if a bag of soybean is worth 70, it's a multiple. If it's worth 150, it's X times 150. That's the first point. So we believe that the price of land will be on a new level because we're not going to talk about soybean worth 70, 80. Soybean, when it… And you are much more smarter than we are, we believe that in the long term we should have soybean around $11. We're talking about a, a balance as a result of ta adjustments, but the price should converge to a balance. This should come to a balance. In terms of acquisition, we're very active. We have spent, we have traveled a lot. We have many things on the radar with different, difference in relation to three years ago. We're also selling at higher numbers than three years ago. We should have an efficient allocation. We are doing everything to guarantee these, this profitability. We have to be very good at buying and transforming the land. And with this, these new levels, and the size of the land, we should be able to transform land more quickly and be able to guarantee good returns for investors. It's an excellent question. Prices have changed for purchase and sale. As I said, we're always buying farms that are not ready, that are not generating this interesting float with commodities. We always buy land that needs development, needs capex management, human capital, to transform these areas. So there will always be opportunities. This is a very large market. We must have discipline, resilience to do what we have done during the last 15 years with a lot of resilience, a lot of discipline. So this is the message we have to all of you. Thank you Ondray. A great question from inaudible, purchase of land, I believe Ondray has answered. Now we have two questions from John Wayne and Edgar Caster concerning sugarcane. Do you believe that the prices of sugarcane should, should continue at high levels due to ethanol for decarbonization? How do you see this scenario? And Edgar's question in relation to sugarcane. He wants a guidance in relation to sugarcane for the next harvest, Whether they will continue at the current levels. Well two excellent questions. I'd like to spend all afternoon. First, John. First we have, we have a clean energy ethanol, not only ethanol as a source to substitute fossil fuels, but ethanol also for hybrid cars. We believe that if we migrate to an auto industry to, that wants to decarbonize, decarbonization, we need a matrix that will generate fuel for electric cars. So we believe a lot that ethanol becomes fundamental. What I'd like to say too, John, Brazil was a country that approved right now in decarbonization, a new program which is RenovaBio. It's a government program, RenovaBio is a state program that is here to be another source of revenue for producers of ethanol and to compensate the industry that produces fossil fuels. So I'm sure that ethanol will be more and more relevant. I get sad when I see the world working for a balanced situation, and companies saying, Oh now it's, it's better to buy gasoline instead of ethanol. We have to be, we have to decide what we want. Emissions than ethanol will be important in this industry in the next few years. Edgar's question is very good. Why is it good? Because sugarcane is a crop with annua cycles. It is pluriannual so the effects that we have in a harvest, they continue until the next harvest. So why do I say they continue? We have two large imports effecting sugarcane and, and Brazilian production. We have the first, the intensity of the drought. So we had rainfall that stopped earlier. And we had important results. And the second, we had a second when we had severe cold in the south. The drought is known. It hurts but if, the next year we have rainfall within the average, you can recover. The great problem is when we have cold weather, when it happened in July\/August, we had most of the sugarcane already harvested and planted, which is for the next harvest so you can imagine the plant had used its reserves to, and suddenly comes the cold and it, it has to begin again. So our experience when this happens for any reasons due to fire, or cold, or, we have an important drop because the plant used its energy. So I would say to you, next year, two scenarios. One optimistic, one pessimistic. And this is not from us, it's not from Ondray or Gustavo. This is the pessimistic one is for 130 million tons, and the optimistic 550 due to these problems with the frost and everything. So if you ask me, I believe in a year of favorable prices for sugarcane. For Brazilian production we have to look, it's important to look outside Brazil the production of sugar in India. Especially in India, we're having a recovery, a modest recovery, in the production of sugar in India. And you can see this with the prices of pound per sugar in New York. I don't remember having seen sugarcane at 21 cents like we had a few months ago. So the scenario for next year, since it's a pluriannual crop, the impact we have this year will continue next year. We will have low inventory of raw material and that puts pressure on the price during the next year. Well the next question comes from Anthony Gordon inaudible. As announced in the summit of COP26 last year, Brazil signed a treaty, an agreement for deforestation ending deforestation by 2030. How will this effect our company? Anthony, good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I believe it's important to understand what they proposed. Brazil, I believe what Brazil signed is our obligation, zero deforestation, illegal deforestation by 2030. This is what they signed. In other wards for zero illegal deforestation in Brazil. We're talking about illegal deforestation. Okay, let's look at, let's look at us independent whether it's legal or illegal. We have few areas in our land to be transformed, and all of them are savannah lands being transformed, and the inaudible that are being transformed. And we have the best expectations to finish this development by 2025. So illegal de- deforestation, yes it what Brazil signed and every time we see these commitments and they become a reality for companies like ours, companies that have governance, companies that respect the environment, that have management, I believe it is even more decisive for us to take action. We, so, the great, one problem in Brazil, is that there is illegal, not in agro-business I would say, ill-illegal, deforestation in the Amazon that is illegal, Government areas, Indian reservations. Thank you Ondray. Question from Victor inaudible concerning, can you talk about the technology projects in the field? How can 5G help? We will stay her until tomorrow, so I'll ask Ondray to be… We have another question. Victor, excellent question. As Anna said, I love this topic. I will give you some numbers from <unk>. Brazil with investments of 4,500 antennas. Today Brazil has a coverage of 5G 17-20 % With 4,500 new antennas, we will take 5G coverage to 50% of the agricultural land. With 15,000 antennas, which is not a very high investment, we take coverage of 5G around 80% of the areas in production in Brazil. I will give you a number, I will share with a number from M- BROP. This first coverage around 50% of the Brazilian agricultural area, that would be 50, another 50, 60 billion reals from agriculture. If we can take this to 80%, the estimates, and of course we're talking about technology, we can get to numbers upwards of 110 billion reals generated to add to our GDP. So Gustavo, we're, and I are leading projects the company has some units where we have coverage not all the farm, but not only 5G, also other technologies. Biological connectivity linked to 5G, innovation of many things, many tools, drones for monitoring, many things that are being done in agro-business. And this will represent the new green revolution that agro-business can bring. The next question Antonio Sicadum concerning the measurement of ESG policies in Brazil, environment, social, and governance. Antonio, we here in the company, we feel at ease to talk about ESG. I will look at the three letters. When we talk about governance, we're the first company agro-business to be listed in Novo Mercado, the elite companies in the stock market. The only one also listed in New York. Also inaudible with more governance even the stocks legislation. So when we look inside, we were born this way. It's in out DNA. When you talk about social. For being in boundaries, we did a lot of this. We made many investments in social programs. When you take SAP to these regions, you have to train people, invest resources, and the company has invested a lot in social programs. We created the Brazil Agro Institute and Apollo is the director of the institute. We invest 1.5 to 2% of our results in projects with focus on education in the regions where we are present. When we talk about the environment, the company had the capacity and efficiency to manage the assets. It had to transform more than 135,000 hectors. You can see this is linked to conservation preservation. We have, we have, uh, thousands of hectors of protected areas. And this, the environmental, these are the actions in the environment to preserve biodiversity. So I would say that agro-business has everything to lead other sectors in terms of ESG. Well we like to close. Once again, thank you for participating Ondray, Gustavo. And we will se you again in the next quarter. Thank you. Thank you Anna, thank you Gustavo, thank you participants who are with us with many questions. WE had the greatest number of questions, very good questions, intelligent questions focused on our business model. Thank you for attention once again. Count on our team, team of people. We're showing the results of a team which has been doing good work committed to the results of the common-company committed with the investors. To the investors, we will continue, continue this way delivering resilient results. Thank you. We wish you a good afternoon.",
      "withCtc" : "Good afternoon. Welcome everyone to Brasilagos Q one twenty twenty two results conference call. Today I'm here with Mr. Andre Guilla Moncio and Mr Gustavo Lopez, administrative offices and and investor relations officer. The company's year begins on july first. So that is why we are reporting Q one, the three months that ended on September thirtieth, twenty twenty one. Well, this transmission is being recorded. It is transmitted at our website and also on YouTube, and here we're talking about estimates and declarations concerning the business perspectives of the companies, projections, operational goals based on Andrew. Our presentation. Now I would like to pass the floor to Mr. Andre to begin our presentation. Anna, thank you. Thank you, Gustavo, to all of you who are here in our conference calls. It's a great Even before I arrived I asked the team, gee, where are we going to have our bar? We're raising the bar, the res the results during this quarter would are the same as the ones that we would celebrate as the year's results. So the company is on a new level. We have a better prepared company in terms of real estate and operations. It is a company that is totally different today. So we will begin with the highlights of our quarter and then as usual we will be open to have our QA. Well, those who are sharing, let's begin with the first slide. Okay. The highlights that we bring here for Q one as Anna reminded us very well, this is Q one which began on july first. We had a net revenue of three hundred seventy eight million in this period. We had a net profit of a hundred seven point nine million and an adjusted a bit of one hundred and ninety point six million. The estimate for the harvest that we are ending, the numbers two point six million tons of grains, cotton and sugar cane, one hundred and sixty eight thousand hectares in production. And now we have the excellent news that we gave in the last meetings of the company concerning the General Assembly on october twenty seventh occasion, the approval for a record dividend payment two hundred and sixty million in dividends for the previous year, two point sixty two reais per share. So always bringing to the investor. Last year was a great investment if we consider the appraisal of our shares and also the size of the dividend that we are paying that will represent approximately nine percent this year. Nine percent. Next slide. Well in the highlights in the last call. Or the call before last we said we are vended. We are sellers. We are working on purchases too. In the last call, we're going to do that. the sale of these two farms. I'd like to remind you, last year when we talked about two hundred and sixty million in dividends, they are they are linked to an excellent operational results last year and a small part of this came from the sale of farms, real estate. Here we already have relevant results from the sale of real estate. The first sale is Rio do Meio. Those who have been with us for a short time, this came from the acquisition that we made from Agri Firma. We acquired two farms, Vila Dume and Rojadin, and we're selling a third. This farm has approximately eight thousand hectares and we're selling two thousand eight hundred. We acquired this recently, January twenty twenty, the the value of the transaction. The NAB NAB the this one third of the farm represents the value of the whole acquisition of the farm. So this shows the potential and of value generation that the company has in terms of real estate results. The second sale, the most important sale of the company higher higher volume, five hundred and eighty nine million reais. And also we told the market about a farm that we acquired in the past in tw tw twenty oh six two thousand and six worth ten thousand per hectare and now we're selling at one hundred and fifty, one hundred and sixty thousand per hectare. And I would like to mention two fundamental points for you the sale will be recorded both the first sale Rio Domeo and the second will be recorded in our accounting during the new qu the next quarter and the sale of Al Tutaqwari has a different recording, different posting. We sold two thousand seven hundred hectares and this sale of two thousand seven hundred hectares we will record in two moments. When we deliver, we will deliver one thousand five hundred hectares initially and we will record this part, this result on the fifteen hundred hectares. What will we do with the other twelve hundred hectares? We will continue exploring. It has sugar cane. We will continue until the harvest of twenty twenty three and then we will deliver the second part and then we will record the sale. So this is how we do our Well what I'd like to say here two points. First, the company's capacity to increase its operational area, even being a very efficient company in terms of the sale of real estate. So if we look year after year we have a growth of ten percent of the cultivated area, planted area, and this comes from our own land, leased land, development of land, but shows to you investors, those who follow us, the capacity to increase more and more operational results in an efficient way and in a safe way. The graph also beside you shows the breakdown of the types of crops I'd like to call your attention. Basically in the harvest twenty one-twenty two, we are increasing the cultivated area of winter crop for corn, corn winter crop. Later on we will talk about prices, so we see an optimistic scenario for winter corn. And also more and more maintaining products that have more added value, maintaining the areas with beans. Well, here we have a summary we will grow in production. Here we see twenty twenty one and what we're estimating for twenty twenty two harvest. Soybean an important increase from one hundred and seventy three thousand tons to one hundred ninety six thousand tons. Winter corn, the most important leap some areas were intensifying the planting of corn because of the prices that you are following. So corn, winter crop. Here we see also in other areas in Bahia, for example. And here we see an overlap of winter corn and corn. And here we can continue seeing the numbers. We have the crop. We had some drought in Mato Grosso and in the northeast, so the winter crop has an increase, but it does not refer to the area. It refers to a recovery or maintenance of our uh normal results. When we look year after year when we look total growth in production, we went from two hundred and eighty seven to three hundred and ninety eight thousand tons. Last column. Well, this is a thermometer. This is a new slide. An Apollo prepared this. It's very good to show first on the graph below. Here the the graph below represents the ideal window for planting. This is a picture of the company. We'd like to remind you that this these numbers are from Friday. So we can see here the amount planted. Also another point, we have operations in Mato Grosso. P part of the plant with soybean is in the northeast. It is a window that is different from Matu Grosso and there we are also seeing the results from Shingu. We will continue and we can see here the results soybean, corn, cotton, and beans in the harvest twenty twenty-one-2022. We can also see here twenty twenty one and twenty two almost harvest year in cattle raising. We can see here cattle heads, pasture, and ADG. So beans. We have some of the results already in by you. Next, please. Well, here sugar cane. I would like to say that we have we see a great evolution in the number. You can see here the production in thousands of tons and the number of hectares for sugar cane, then the harvest area and the number of tons. And the actual numbers for sugar cane. Um all open things based up on open books in the old thing. Sugarcane did was not affected by the drought we have irrigation to our agreement with Agrocere, and in the case of the Midwest it is not irrigated, but the risk is much smaller. So when we look at Brazil agro and Brazil in sugar cane. We have almost five hundred and eighty, five hundred and ninety, which is and we see the harvest at the end of now with five hundred and twenty thousand tons the company had a a drop. Here we see the generation of results, bringing a lot of results from real estate sales. So what did we do here? So during a time of spectacular prices we have to max maximize our inventory. We had an inventory of cattle at a low price. ye Larast we had a good strategy to decrease the volume to be more aggressive in sales, generating results. And apart from all of this, we generated spectacular results in the business units when we closed on june thirty and this is a picture now. It's not gonna be two the twenty twenty the twenty twenty we had a G M D, the highest in history. Maybe part of this comes from a lower load. So with less pressure in the pasture land and GMD had again we gained five hundred grams of GMD very similar to the market. We're estimating now the closing with zero seventy. This is what places the company as an excellent producer of sugar cane, excellent producer of beef and other also other crops. Here what I'd like to stress is the company's capacity, resilience of the company to move this to inventory, capture the good prices, and the last bubble, the the last slide shows that cattle raising in the company is being done with a lot of operational results and good techniques. Next slide please. Well here we're talking about the current harvest and here I'd like to repeat this we're always with a good contribution margin, what we expect per hectare. So we have a moral obligation to make progress every time we have a good contribution margin. And depending on the price of sale, we're always looking at contribution margin, the difference of between sale and costs on this date we can see the amount of corn sold at a price of sixty six ninety six. Most of the corn production is winter crop, so here we have a mix of prices between corn in the northeast than in the Midwest. So we have fifty percent of the next harvest. When we look this in comparison with last year fifty reis and now sixty seven reis. At the bottom we see soybean. We're also making progress in soybean. Here we can see the main figures, revenues from operations, when we look at the future and the exchange rate was cinchado closing at five point fifty seven reis per dollar, a little higher than the previous uh previous This will help us with an even more robust result this year because we have prices that are higher than the other. The last line is cotton, where we have progress, an important progress, sixty eight percent in sales in relation. Actually in relation to this harvest, with a price of one hundred and sixty three reais. When we look at the price of the previous, it was at a hundred and eight reais. And you will see we also intensified the area with cotton this year. We had an important increase due to what we can see in terms of margin for cotton. Next slide. Well, here I'd like to pass the floor to Gustavo to talk about the numbers and then we will be back. Thank you, Andre. Good afternoon. Here we're showing the main numbers of the quarter in uh Anna as Anna mentioned and so on and also and twenty junior one october our this is the year until june thirty next year and here what we can see an increase of eighty three percent in net revenue of the company. We see a net profit one hundred seven million reais, forty three percent above last year. And And it's important to stress and the increase in price for corn, soybean, and especially in sugar cane is what is what leveraged all these results. It's important to mention that during this quarter we we harvested almost one million tons of sugar cane for the whole uh and we should expect results that will continue to come in from sugarcane and our expectation is that the price increases will continue leveraging or improving the operational results. When we look at adjusted a bit uh the and this shows the the performance and here we include derivatives as Andre mentioned in the previous page. So we see one hundred and ninety million reis. Last year we had a sale a sale and this year we're expecting for next quarter to To record the sale of Rio de Mayo Farm and part of the second farm, as Andre mentioned. On the next page here, the highlight is the hundred and ninety million reis. We see adjusted a bit here last year. Here we see the price of sugarcane, which almost doubled last year. We had sixty eight rey peres kilogram. Now it's one hundred and thirty, one hundred and thirty five, reminding you that there is an expectation in the market to close at one hundred ninety six, hundred ninety five and we have a premium of twenty percent in the contract with Saint Saint Joseph. The weight of sugarcane this year from sugar cane will be much higher than before. Reminding here in the case of soybean and cotton we're selling the inventory of the harvest that we collected recently. And with prices in soy being forty five percent higher. So we reinforce we're expecting an Ebita that will be very similar to that of june thirtieth last year, but the impact in the price of sugar cane will provoke a significant increase. On the next page, we can see here the company's numbers. We continue with uh a year end report that is stable, strong. We see We see here assets four point one percent. Um also in the company's cash on september thirtieth it had an increase in relation to june thirtieth because we're selling the inventory of soybean and and corn. It's important to say that accounts receivables accounts receivable short term, long term four hundred million reais due to the sale of farms. Here we're including receivables of the new s farms that we sold and we will record in the next quarter. We see also property for investment, the company's farms, one billion reis and we see cash, total indebtedness and and we will see more details on the next phase. Well here we see in terms of short term three hundred twenty five million reais, short term debts, long term three hundred million reais, total six hundred and twenty six million reais, five percent lower than on june thirtieth. Here, one objective we had in the past that we mentioned to you. To have a longer debt two hundred and forty million uh we have for five years and three hundred million reais, which is what we need to plant and the company's operation. So this we are working to renew these uh debts. When we consider the gross debt adjusted adjusted gross debt or net gross debt in net gross debt, we see it's negative, but we expect to make some investments, especially in in compra de facendo in purchasing farms, transformation of areas that we have in the land bank. And we will be very careful with the company's cash. The company's numbers, the company's debt at reasonable levels. Here we have the cost eight point five percent if we consider the future curves and interest rates. On the next page. Here this is we'd like to say that the General Assembly approved the payment of two hundred si andxty million reais in dividends we will pay on the tenth after tomorrow, november tenth after tomorrow. And here I'd like to stress that although we don't have uh a clear dividend policy, uh the objective of the company is To have a dividend yield of five five point three percent. So this is what we will have as a goal. On the next page we we will see net asset value three point two million reis. Here Here this is the cost. These are the numbers. These numbers r re reflect the cost, the value of the property in the company with an internal evaluation lower than that of Deloitte's evaluation. Deloitte had said three point four billion reais. We also always consider our evaluation. We see that the net value of the company four point three, four point four billion reis and with the number of shares forty two point seventy five forty two point seventy five reis per share. So once again we like to talk about the great potential for upside and we invite you to continue to invest in our company. On the next page, the last slide, we see an evolution of the stock market and our share, aggro three on November fourth. Here we show the performance of the company. company to with positive re results. So we believe that our company is excellent opportunity for investments. We thank you for participating and now we will go on to the QA session. If you have a question, please through the webcast in writing, we're receiving the comp the questions here and I will read them. The first question, Carlos Herrera. What is the difference between NAB and price of shares sixty eight percent. Do you see opportunities to r buy back shares? Looking company, huh? Of course, we have an important gap, but we have worked to increase the shareholder base, to increase the free float of the company. I'd like to remind you before the pre follow on we traded one to two million And since the follow on, twenty five to thirty million are being traded every day. We monitor this and when we believe this will make sense, yes, we will approve that through the council of the company, the company's council today. We consider our the evaluation of the properties. It's as if it were worth one point five billion. And we know we have a portfolio of three point four billion. So we are now having the farms that are the cheapest in the Brazilian market. We're we're looking to see if there are opportunities to launch a new program. Maybe not with such high volumes, but we might buy back shares to show to the market the the value of the shares. Also Carlos the resources that we're raising with the sale of farms. How will we use these resources? Will it be used to pay dividends, the sale of farms? Carlos, a good question. It's important to stress that the company in the sale of farms we have a lower cost of capital than the producer. So we can finance the transaction. So in purchases we're more aggressive with cash purchases because we have a cost of capital that makes sense. So I would say to you that first, it's important to stress these sales were made with a duration of two point five in one transaction, two point nine in the other, approximately two point five, two point six. So the revenue from these transactions, I'd like to stress the sale of Takwari was made in two times. It will be recorded in two instances. We should record three hundred and thirty million in during this year and the remainder the five hundred ninety million only in twenty twenty four and the sale of Rio do Meyo should also be recorded during this year but it is also sold in installments. So I joke we we we buy we buy with down payments cash and we sell in installments. This will give us a result. Gustavo showed us how we're showing the results of Q one with higher prices, better results, and different from last year, right, Carlos? Last year we had very few sales of real estate in the company's results. So the company will be aggressive once again due to the results we will have. And I always say with good opportunities we will buy farms without good opportunities or limited opportunities we'll be a we will be aggressive in distributing in We also had a question from Damien in line with the previous question concerning the buy back of shares. So I believe we have already answered now, Vitor Saragiotuk Credit Suisse. Congratulations for the results and many concerns in relation to the price of fertilizer that went up during the last month. So do you have delays in the delivery of fertilizer for this harvest? Oh I I was in Shingu this week. I came back on Saturday. It it's a pity that it's not live. We were there, we went to visit large areas of the region, we were very happy with what we saw. So we had operations left. We went to look And you did not go with me. We're always inviting you to come to go with us to shingle. But going back to your question, we are following the price of fertilizer. I believe it's very important to see the results, how things are happening. The fertilizer industry, phosphate or nitrogen, most of it is born from natural gas. You produce natural gas. I always said this. So you have to produce also from nitrogen urea. And with nitrogen, urea or ammonia and natural gas, y this is the raw material for phosphate based fertilizer. So being frank, we don't believe in a price drop for fertilizers in the next six months. Why six months because we are now at a time of greater consumption of natural gas in the world due to due to the winter in the northern hemisphere. So in December, January we have the highest consumption of natural gas for heating homes. So we have a competitor. This always happens every year. So and now we have very high prices for natural gas. You can see the prices, the the price of natural gas. But in Europe too, the price of natural gas went up two hundred and eight percent in the last six months. So it's fundamental to see this industry in this way. The fertilizer industry on a on a global level has raw materials. I uh I know that many potassium plants will begin producing, phosphate plants will begin producing. And in terms of n nitrogen, we have this great concern with gas, which it has a direct effect. So So the way we see it, Victor, there will be an impact, an important impact for Brazil in terms of the second crop, the winter crop. Same for Brazil agro we're projecting this in our numbers, an important impact for the second crop. For the for for uh the previous one, we have all the fertilizer bought. So we we have a crop with the previous prices, but they will go up. It's important to see when we look at the price of last year, the price of sale for this harvest, we're expecting very positive margins for us. The great question in the market is what will happen in the future from now on. We're looking at fertilizer but also agrochemicals with increases in US currency. We're talking about increases in dollars, ten to fifteen percent depending on the chemical. So it's uh we we have to be careful. There are many consequences for the increase in in of prices in chemicals. Fertilizer is based So this is for the harvest twenty two twenty three we're monitoring. We're already monitoring this, Victor, and I as I always say when we believe that there is something to do we are making decisions. Fertilizers, nothing yet, but agrochemicals, yes. We have already uh we already have a strategy. In in tur in terms of logistics, no problems until now. Gustavo reminded us we put pressure for delivery until now, no problems, no lack of fertilizer. All our fertilizers for this that was planted from October to December is already in in our properties. Winter crop we bought most of it. There is a part in nitrogen to buy. But phosphate, I was looking this week and I said, Why so much fertilizers here. What and they said, No, this is the win fertilizer for the winter crop. We're receiving fertilizer for the winter crop. Well in line with Victor's question, Neri from V T Pacto asked concerning the cost of production. The company's estimates for twenty one twenty two show important increases in the cost for the main crops, please comment on how you expect this will impact the profitability this year and the and now we know the price of commodities is favorable. Do you believe there will be a risk for this harvest or next? I believe Andre has already answered these questions. And the next question, Leonardo Lenka, she's pay investments. First, he says congratulations for the results. Thank you. I believe you have a the harvest for soybean and the winter crop for corn. I believe you have bought the fertilizer. How about the future fertilizer for twenty two, twenty three? Have you bought the fertilizer? What is your vision concerning the fertilizer market? Andre has already answered all these questions from Leonardo. And the next question is I believe that in this question I'd like to say this is it. We have two concerns. We have the sugar cane harvest that begins in April May with nitrogen fertilizers. Our perspective as we said the base industry, the base raw material is natural gas natural gas. We don't believe in a drop in natural gas, especially now with the cold season in the northern hemisphere. The way we see it after winter in the northern hemisphere with more natural gas available at the end of the first semester next year, beginning of the second semester twenty twenty two, we can expect a drop in the price of fertilizer, especially nitrogen. The next question, Flavio Bica. Congratulations for the results. Could you tell us more about rainfall in the various farms? Flavio, thank you for the question. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I would say the following. This year the behavior is much better than last year. You can see you follow us, not only the company but all the market information. Mato Grosso as I said is is finishing the planting. Last year we had a lot of problems in the state of Mato Grosso during the planting season, a lot of complex You you heard me talking about replanting in Mato Grosso, in the press, in the company or even uh in other companies. No one is talking about this this year because it's not happening. The climate is well with a good window, a good distribution, and the good news is that the region in Mapito also Rainfall began a little earlier. We have a lot of soybean planted in Marign, Piauí, Bayatu, things that we know that historically these are regions we have rainfall in Mapito in November and this year already in October. So in terms of Brazil when we talk about the situation, this is it. Now in the long term things are positive. We have a year that is launing And this allows us a good distribution of rainfall in Mapito, within average in the Midwest, and we're always concerned with the south of Brazil. When we talk about the south of Brazil so talking about Brazil agro, our concern this year is Paraguay. Paraguay, we had good rain, but we know that we begin to plant in the and in the end of November. We have good rainfall, but we're always looking at the climate in Paraguay, the rainfall in Paraguay. We reduce the exposure in Paraguay to new areas. Areas where we have coverage, where we have been working for a long time, we will continue, we will continue planting, respecting And planting in a defensive way. But we're concerned with Paraguay and we're also concerned with the south of Brazil and also Argentinians should also be concerned with their climate. In Bolivia the climate is normal. We're beginning we began fifteen de fifteen days ago. The second harvest for soybean, the the winter crop for soybean is more representative than the previous. So we're beginning and the rainfall in Bolivia is within the average in April, May we had a little bit of stress, but now rainfall is normal in Bolivia. There we have a lot of sugar cane. So Flavio, in a nutshell. The company is doing very well, all of Brazil, Midwest and upwards. And we have the a concern with Paraguay and the south of Brazil. The forecast for the year is good in these regions with the exception of the south and Paraguay. The question comes from Walter. Bearing in mind the taxes on dividends, do you intend to anticipate dividends for twenty twenty one tw,enty twenty two? The government intends to charge uh income tax. We have no forecast, but we're looking at the reforms from the government. We're prepared. The company is prepared for this taxation of dividends as the government wants to do. This received a lot of attention when we saw the tax reform being prepared. The company is prepared if this actually happens, if this reduces the profitability of the for the investors. We're looking at the tax reform. Well the next question comes from Adrian Pattinson. Concerning fertilizers and chemicals, how much was spent in twenty twenty one and what is the cost for twenty twenty two? Oh, yeah, you're actually looking functionally. Gustavo, você sente essa vontade também prevention. Looking at each product. Gustavo, help me with the numbers. Now the one passado. Last year we had a cost of production in Soybean two thousand six hundred to two thousand eight hundred depending on the region. This year twenty this year th three thousand two hundred to three thousand four hundred. These are there are different farms regions where you have differences, but this is it. In the case of corn, help me with corn, four thousand, three thousand eight hundred reis. Last year, two thousand eight hundred. Corn has a higher cost, it uses more fertilizer, and it also uses more fertilizers with nitrogen. These were the ones that have the highest price increases. So cotton suffers twice. Now in relation to agrochemicals. In the harvest twenty twenty one, twenty twenty two we had no we had no expressive differences in US dollars. We had problems with the it with the exchange rate. When I mentioned previously an increase ten to fifteen percent in dollars, this is for the harvest twenty twenty two, twenty twenty three. This is a forecast for the next harvest, not this harvest that we're planting now. We're talking about twenty twenty two, twenty twenty three. We're estimating a possible increase in the price of agrochemicals due to many points. Natural gas, environmental restrictions, ocean freight that had high increases. And we know that the chemical molecules in Brazil, the finished products are imported in containers, so ocean freight and this issue of containers, lack of containers that you see. Lack of containers containers that came from China to America for fourteen hundred dollars, now eighteen twenty thousand dollars. So we begin to have important increases. I'm sure that industry will raise their prices for us. As Andre mentioned, in the harvest twenty twenty and twenty twenty one, we had approximately an increase, roughly fifteen to twenty percent in soybean and thirty percent in corn. For the next also Also twenty three, twenty five percent for soybean increase. Why? Because we were able to buy in advance we also made payments when the US currency was around five reis to a dollar. Now we have the winter crop. We We took more time to buy this in. We're expecting an increase of seventy percent in relation to last year. Where are we making this decision? Last year in Shingu we had an expectation of sales thirty five thirty six reis per bag. Today we're selling and in an anticipated way around sixty sixty five reis per bag. So in terms of margin, they are similar or even better than the increase of the price of fertilizer. Also in relation to production costs, a question from Rafael Somer Logos concerning the price of inputs for sugar cane. I will answer this for a found. So last year this year we began to include the cost of leasing in sugarcane. If you purge this effect, which was not considered last year, the increase is weather very similar to the other crops. Thirty percent, around thirty percent. Later on I can give you the juice with But approximately a thousand reais more in the production price of sugar cane due to the leasing, rental of the farms. The next question, Famianu Zankanir. The company does the company have a hedging policy for contribution margin? The hedge is done at cost or you hedge a hundred percent. Fabiano Zankaner. I had a a colleague in Katanduba had the same name. I had a colleague in Ezalk answering you. We do hedging. We're always monitoring the total revenue of the products and the contribution margin. We monitor the cost and revenue. So when the number that we showed fi almost fifty seven percent in soybean, that is not the cost. It's fifty percent of the volume of soybean produced. In the case of corn, fifty six, the expected volume. Cotton w it's the total volume of cotton expected in relation to our budget, the best expectation of productivity. So hedging for us is total volume projected. What is important too, we we have also receivables from farms, which is important for the company. And the receivables from farms are also in bags of soybean. So all the receivables that mature in that year they become part of the P and L of soybean to be sold. The producer can pay us based on soybean. So we consider the receivables from farms of the year in our analysis of derivatives. And this analysis is also done every quarter by Gustavo based on future perspectives of receivables. So answering your question, we look at the number that you saw as a result of the estimate of production and the policy foresees that we will be able to sell up to fifty percent of the harvest when we plant. Then we monitor the evolution of the crop and we can get to eighty percent at the time of harvest. Sale of eighty percent So we're very strict in following this policy. Fabiano said that he is from Catanduva. Thank you. I had a great friend who graduated with me, Rodrigo Zancaner. Some questions concerning the market of land. The price of land. What does the company think in terms of acquisition of new areas, new sales? There is a question from Murilo. Then we have Adair Castro. Questions on the price of land. And we're seeing a growth of almost a hundred percent in the price of land. Do you believe that these higher prices will continue for land? Well, Murilo Adder, first let's talk about how we think about this. We always say that we have to be an anti cyclical company. Whenever it wants to sell, we buy. Whenever it wants to buy So we buy the assets that are ready, the farm that is producing sugar cane or producing soybean They are very similar to what you asked. This area due to the price of increase in commodities, also the price of the case. When you look at the other areas, pasture are areas to be transformed, we also see price increases, but not as strong as the soybean areas. Soybean areas are multiples of the bag of soybean. If it's if a bag of soybean is worth seventy, it's a multiple. If it's worth one hundred and fifty, it's X times one hundred and fifty. That's the first point. So we believe that the price of land will be on a new level because we're not going to talk about soy being worth seventy, eighty. Soybean went and you are s much more smarter than we are. We believe that in the long term we should have soybean around eleven dollars. We're talking about a uh a balance as a result of tax adjustments. But the price should converge to about In terms of acquisition, we're very active. We have spent we have traveled a lot. We have many things in the radar with different difference in relation to three years, but we're also selling at higher numbers than three years ago. We should have an efficient allocation. We are doing everything to guarantee these these this profitability. We have to be very good at buying and transforming the land. And with these these new levels and the size of the land, we should be able to transform land more quickly and be able to guarantee good uh returns for investors. It's an excellent question. Prices have changed for purchase and sale. As I said, we're always buying farms that are not ready, that are not generating this interesting flow with commodities. We always buy land that needs development, needs capex management, human capital to transform these areas. So there will always be opportunities. This is a very large market. We must have discipline, resilience to do what we have done during the last 15 years with a lot of resilience, a lot of discipline. So this is the message we have to all of you. Thank you, Andre. Question from Hernani Sikira, purchase of land, I believe Andre has answered. Now we have two questions from John Wayne and Ed Eric Castro concerning sugar cane. Do you believe that the prices of sugar cane should should continue at high levels due to ethanol for decarbonization. How do you see this scenario? And adders question in relation to sugar cane. He wants a guidance in relation to sugar cane for the next harvest. Whether they will continue at the current levels. Two excellent questions. I'd like to spend all afternoon. First, John. First we have we have a clean energy ethanol not only ethanol as a source to substitute fossil fuels, but ethanol also for hybrid cars. We believe that if we migrate to an auto industry to that wants to decarbonize decarbonisation, we need a matrix that will generate fuel for electric electric cars. So we believe a lot that ethanol becomes fundamental. What I'd like to say too, John Brazil was a country that approved right now in decarbonisation a new program which is Renovabil. It's a government program. Renova Bio is a state program that is here to be another source of revenue for producers of ethanol and to compensate the industry that produces fossil fuels. So I'm sure that ethanol will be more and more relevant. I get sad when I see the world working for a more balanced situation and companies saying, oh now it's w it's better to buy gasoline instead of ethanol. We have to be we have to decide what we want. Do we want less emissions, then ethanol will be important in this industry in the next few years. Edgar's question is very good. Why is it good? Because sugarcane is a crop with annual cycles. It is pluriannual. So the effects that we have in a harvest they continue until the next harvest. So why do I say? they continue We have two large important effects in sugarcane and and Brazilian production. We have the first the intensity of the drought. So we had r rainfall that stopped earlier and we had important results. And a second we had a second when we had severe cold. The drought is known. It hurts, but if n the next year we have rainfall within the average, you can recover. The great problem is that when we have cold weather, when it happened in July, August, we had most of the sugar cane already harvested and planted, which is for the next harvest. So you can imagine the planted used its reserves to and suddenly comes the cold and the it has to begin again. So our experience when this happens for N reasons due to fire or cold or we have an important drop. Because the plant used its energy. So I would say to you, next year two scenarios one optimistic, one pessimistic. And this is not from us, it's not from Andre or Gustavo. This is the pessimistic one is five hundred and thirty million tons and the optimistic five fifty due to these problems with frost and everything. So if you ask me, I believe in a year of favorable prices for sugar cane for Brazilian production, we have to look it's important to look outside Brazil, the production of sugar in India, especially in India, we're having a recovery, a modest recovery in the production of sugar in India. And you can see this with the prices of pound per sugar in New York. I don't remember having seen sugarcane at twenty one cents like we had a few months ago. So the scenario for next year since it's a pluriannual crop, the impact we had this year will continue. Next year we will have low inventories of raw material and that puts pressure on the price during the next year. Well the next question comes from Anthony Gordon, Genagru. As announced in the summit of COP twenty six last year, Brazil signed a treaty, an agreement for deforestation, ending deforestation by twenty thirty. How will this affect our company? Anthony, good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to talk to you. I believe it's important to understand what they proposed. Brazil. I believe uh what Brazil signed is our obligation zero deforestation, illegal deforestation by twenty thirty. This is what they signed. In other words, to zero illegal deforestation in Brazil. We're talking about illegal deforestation. Okay, let's look at let's look at us independent whether it's legal or illegal, we have a few areas in our pipeline to be transformed and all of them are savannah lands being transformed in the Chakho that are being transformed and we have the best expectations to finish this development by twenty twenty five. So the legal deforest deforestation, yes, is what Brazil signed. And every time we see these commitments and they become a reality for companies like ours, companies that have governance, companies that respect the environment, that have management, I believe it's even more decisive for us to take action. One problem in Brazil is that there is illegal, not in agrobusiness, I would say il illegal de deforestation in the Amazon that is illegal. Government areas, Indian reservations. Thank you, Andre. Question from Victor Ponli Talevanti concerning can you talk about the technology projects in the field? How can five G help? We will stay here until tomorrow. So I'll ask Andre to be We have a another question. Victor, excellent question. As Anna said, I love this topic. I will give you some numbers from Imbrappen. Brazil with investments of four thousand five hundred antennas. Today Brazil has a coverage of five G seventy to twenty percent. With four thousand five hundred new antennas, we will take five G coverage to fifty percent of the agricultural land. With fifteen thousand antennas, which is not a very high investment, we take coverage of five G around eighty percent of the areas in production in Brazil. I'll give you a number, I will share with you a number from MROP. This first coverage around fifty percent of the Brazilian agricultural area. That would be fifty s another fifty, sixty billion reais in a from agriculture. If we can take this to eighty percent the estimates, then of course we're talking about technology we can get to numbers upwards of one hundred and ten billion RAIDs generated to add to our GDP. So uh Gustavo and I are leading projects. The company has some units where we have coverage, not all the farm but not only five G also other technologies. Biological connectivity linked to five G innovation of many things, many tools, drones for monitoring, many things that are being done in agrobus and this will represent the new green revolution that agribusiness can bring. The next question, Antonio Siqueira, concerning the measurement of ESG policies in Brazil environment, social and governance. We here in the company we feel at ease to talk about the I will look at the three letters. When we talk about governance, we're the first company in agribusiness to be listed in novo mercado, the elite companies in the stock market. The only one also listed in New York also plus Ideco with more governance. Even the SOX legislation. So when we look inside, we were born this way. It's in our DNA. When you talk about social for being in boundaries, we did a lot of this. We made many investments in social programs. When you take SAP to these regions you have to train people, invest resources and the company has invested a lot in social programs. We created the Brazil Agro Institute, Ana Paulo is the director of the institute. We invest one point five to two percent of our results in projects with focus on education in the regions where we are present. When we talk about the environment, the company had the capacity and the efficiency to manage the assets it had to transform more than one hundred and thirty five thousand hectares. You can see this is linked to conservation preservation. We have we have uh thousands of hectares of protected areas. And this This the environmental these are the actions in the environment to preserve biodiversity. So I would say that agribusiness has everything to lead other sectors in terms of ESG. Andre, Gustavo, and we will see you again in the next quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Anna, thank you, Gustavo, thank you participants who are with us with many questions. We have the greatest number of questions, very good questions, intelligent questions, focused on our business model. Thank you for your attention. Once again, count on our team, team of people. We're showing the result of a team which has been doing good work, committed with the the results of the comedy company, committed with the investors to the investors. We will continue, continue this way, delivering resilient results. Thank you. We wish you a good afternoon."

      "baseline" : "Welcome to the Goal Airlines third quarter 2021 results conference call. This morning, the company made its numbers available along with three videos with the results presentation, financial review, and preliminary QA. Goal hopes everyone connected has watched them. After the company's brief remarks, we will initiate the QA session when further instructions will be provided. This event is also being broadcast live via webcast and may be accessed through the company website at www.voe.com.com dot br slash ir and on the MZIQ platform at www.mzik.com. Those following the presentation via the webcast may post their questions on the platform, and their questions will either be answered by the management during this call or by the goal investor relations team after the conference is finished. Before proceeding, let me mention that forward looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of goals management and on information currently available to the company. Risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors and analysts should understand that events related to macroeconomic conditions, industry and other, factors could also cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. At this time, I hand you over to Mr. Paul Kakinoff, CEO. Please begin. Good morning everyone and welcome to Go Red Lines Quarterly Earnings Call. I would like to start by highlighting our most important achievements of this period. The first one was the continued recovery in demand, which showed solid growth during the third quarter. At the end of September, Brazil became fourth among all countries with the most vaccines administered against COVID-19. Approximately fifty-six percent of Brazil's population is fully vaccinated, and over seventy-four percent have received their first dose, a higher percentage than the vast majority of the countries, including the United States. Similar to demand trends in other markets, the rising vaccination rate in the general population is supporting the air market's ongoing recovery. As a result, ghost departures in the fourth quarter grew by 87%, reaching 53% of the levels in 2019. In response to this demand, Goes expanding its network and has already announced a new route from Congonhas to Bonito, starting this December. We are taking a conservative approach to increasing capacity as travel demand recovers to help maintain high load factors and profitability in our roads. The second important event was the transition of the fleet to Boeing Maxis. In preparation for the strong recovery in air travel that we expect to see in the coming quarters, we signed agreements to accelerate the transformation of our fleet with the acquisition of twenty-eight additional Boeing seven three seven MAX8 aircraft. This initiative is expected to reduce the company's unit cost by eight percent in twenty twenty two. Under the new contracts, we went two thousand twenty-one with twenty-eight Max aircraft, which represents twenty percent of the fleet. By the end of two thousand twenty two, we expect to have forty four max aircraft raising this total to 32%. With current purchase commitments, we will meet our 2030 goal of having 75% of the fleet in this new aircraft. And as is widely recognized, the max is fifteen percent more fuel efficient, generates sixty percent less carbon emissions, and is forty percent quieter compared to the NG. This aircraft positions to grow even more competitively, expanding routes to new destinations and providing efficiency gains, all of which will capture more value for all our stakeholders. The third important achievement was the conclusion of the merger with Smiles into GLA. The transaction will generate greater value from several operational synergies as well as new opportunities and strategies that will become even more significant during the airline market recovery. We are optimistic that the synergies from this corporate reorganization expected to be approximately three billion in net present value for the next five years, and the subsequent benefits to our shareholders will be realized in a relatively short period of time. With that, I will hand the floor over to Richard, our CFO, Thank you, Kaki. Our most recent notable event was the success of our liability management program. In September, we issued $150 million in a retap at 8% annual interest rate on our senior secured notes, maturing in 2026. Moody's assigned the notes a rating of B2. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including aircraft acquisitions and working capital. In October, we refinanced our short-term bank debt in the amount of 1.2 billion reais via the extension of the seventh series of debentures and the issuance of our eighth series of simple non convertible debentures. This refinancing enabled the company to return to its lowest level of short-ter debmt since 2014 at about a half a billion reais, which will also improve goals credit metrics by better matching future assets and liabilities and reducing the company's average cost of debt. Our next relevant maturity date for outstanding debt is not until July 2024. Gold's balance sheet is now in a stronger position in terms of its outstanding debt versus our peers, which we view to be a competitive advantage in the current market environment. In addition, the company amortized around 518 million reais of debt in this quarter. The average maturity of goal's long-term debt, excluding aircraft leases and perpetual notes, is approximately 3.4 years with the main obligations already addressed in our cash flow. The net debt ratio, excluding exchangeable notes and perpetual bonds to adjusted last 12 months EBDA, was nine point seven times on september thirtieth, two thousand twenty one, representing the lowest financial leverage among peers. Considering the amounts fundable from deposits and unencumbered assets, the company's potential sources of liquidity resulted in approximately 6.1 billion reais of accessible liquidity. The recent capitalization of the balance sheet, with a capital increase led by the majority shareholder, represented the recognization of gold's value as Brazil's largest airline with the best product. The refinancing of our short term bank debt in October added to long term capital of two point seven billion reais raised in the second and third quarters of this year totals over three point nine billion reis of capital raised in the last seven months. As for our discussion of financial results for the quarter, it was shared this morning in the video presentation, and we believe you all had a chance to access that. In short, our work to reestablish operating margins that can support the sustained growth of our operations is bearing fruit. We ended the third quarter with an eBIT reaching three hundred and thirty eight million reies and an operating margin totaling seventeen point seven percent. Concurrently, the adjusted EBITDA reached four hundred and sixty four million reis with a twenty four point three percent margin, evidencing Thanks, Richard. We are seeing a recovering demand for air travel, and we believe that now, with greater population immunisation and the significant expansion of vaccination, we will have a strong fourth quarter coinciding with the start of the summer season. I would like to close by thanking our employees, the team of Eagles, who are working with extreme professionalism and commitment. All this intimidation puts us in a solid position to expand operations and achieve profitable growth. We reiterate our confidence that gold will emerge as strong and even more resilient as markets normalize. Now I would like to initiate the QA session. Thank you. The conference call is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press star one on your touch tone phone at this or any time. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star too. We ask that when you ask your questions, speak close to the receiver of the device so that everyone can hear you clearly. Participants can also send questions via the webcast platform. You need to click on the question mark in the upper left corner and type in your question. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Stephen Trent with City. Please go ahead. Good morning, gentlemen, and uh thanks very much for uh uh taking my questions, guys. Um I just kind of wanted, you know, your high level views on uh international demand to the US spooling up again. You know, uh now that you're partnering with American Airlines, you know, w what sort of bigger opportunity are you seeing on the horizon? And do you see any opportunity as well for American to possibly uh increase its stake and goal at some point in the future. Hi Steven Kirchnoff here. Good morning. Thank you very much for your question. Uh let me give you an overview on the North American market specifically. Uh firstly, you know, we are uh now gradually reintroducing our international routes. So we have uh uh already made available the ticket sales for uh Cancun, New Mexico, Dominican uh Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and we are now resuming flights to Montevideo and and Buenos Aires. So uh United States uh it will be likely the route to be added uh in our uh international portfolio by the second quarter next year and this is because uh you're right the the borders are now open to to the Brazilians but and there is a a a considerable but uh which is uh the the fault the exchange rate made the the purchase the the ticket purchase and the whole street cost, uh uh including hotels, credit card expense, pretty expensive from a Brazilian perspective. Uh you know, the real has uh devoluted quite significantly along the last quarter. So the Brazilian economic conditions uh is uh also uh w was a fa were factored during the the last three months and the combination of a clear excitement to resume international trips uh has a great contrast with the the important constraints imposed by the exchange rate. So the passengers are willing to fly mainly to the United States, uh but the that that trip became quite quite expensive at the moment. So uh I cannot say that there is a a boom uh related to North American ticket uh to uh related to airline tickets uh to fly to to the United States. You know, we are about to begin the Brazilian high season, December and January. And uh typically that that's the period when you see more passengers uh willing to to to travel for a leisure purpose. This is not gonna be different this year, maybe uh uh slightly uh better for the international markets. And the second constraint which is also affecting the demand is that there is a a backlog to provide uh North American visas to the Brazilians which will not be uh uh sold or uh neither addressed in the short term. So if you have a a five members uh a family of five members, uh it's pretty much likely that least one of them has no valid visa uh at the moment. Make n making not it possible to to fly to the United States. So all those things combined uh are uh affecting the the potential uh uh uh flight uh uh catch up that we could get if not by this these two uh constraints. And finally in our case we have the partnership with American Alliance who has uh already deployed a a considerable uh ST increase uh for the following three months. So we have decided uh to to support uh that investment by selling n the American Alliance tickets in our channels as as we have done already since April two thousand twenty. Uh and through that strategy we are simultaneously uh tending our customers and uh uh uh supporting this additional capacity increase deployed by American Alliance, our partners. So we believe that this is the the the the best uh strategy to to cope with the current demand and then we will uh resume our own flight from Brasilia to Florida uh a market w which has not been attended by American Alliance at the moment from the second or next year on. So this is I mean an overview on the North American market on the Brazilian perspective in the airline segment. And and and just very quickly uh one last thing uh on business travel, any sort of high level trends you're seeing in the domestic market and and let me leave it at that. Thank you. We we uh might be surprised by uh the speed uh uh through which the the business segment is uh recovering the uh uh the uh its pre pandemic uh level. We are now uh verifying that identifying actually that some specific segments in Brazil is catching up uh its business travel behavior uh even above the the pre pandemic level. Those are the services in uh generally speaking, uh mainly those those companies pretty much uh uh uh benefited by by the the new customer behavior. So like food delivery, just to say uh uh one example and and e commerce. So those segments are are booming and they are probably more than they were uh before the pre pandemic and also uh some i if I could say so some other traditional segments, uh those are pretty strong in in Brazil, uh such as the agricultural business, oil and gas and some specific industries. So we we foresee that by the beginning of the next year we might be above our prior projection, which has considered that one third of the business travellers would be gun for good, which might be not the case. So i it it's it's too early to be precise uh on that projection but uh at this this moment we see that some uh segments are recovering faster than than expected. Great thank you very much, Kaki. Thank you. The next question is from Mike Lindenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Oh yeah. Hey, good morning everybody. Um I want to just um kind of run through liquidity and I don want't to make sure I'm sort of comparing apples to apples here. So SEPQ, your total liquidity, it looked like it ended at two point one billion REIs and you're guiding to three eight at year end. Is that um Rich, is that predominantly the American airlines investment and an improvement or an increase in your ATL? Or is there other things we should be mindful of? Yeah no the you know any any transaction that's not closed is not in those numbers. So that that is not in those numbers, Michael, nor is new additional uh capital raising. Um the the Q three number, uh and I'll I'll walk you through that. Q three number, which was composed of the four billion reais that you mentioned, which is about uh one point one billion of cash and investments, about three hundred million reais of restricted cash, about six hundred million reais of accounts receivable, and one point nine billion reais of deposits. Uh the way that would break down in the Q four would be about nine uh uh nine hundred to a billion reize of cash and investments about this uh which is down around uh two hundred million reyes because as we ramp up uh to the high season and get our fleet back up above a hundred operating aircraft, we're investing in working capital, spare parts, if you will, to um uh get all these aircraft up and flying. So that that's effectively going into uh assets uh but it's obviously consuming some liquidity and to some extent it's also increasing our spare parts inventory which uh supports the collateral in our senior secured notes program. Uh the restricted cash uh will be a similar balance of around three hundred million reis. Yep. Uh accounts receivable accounts receivable increases about two hundred million reais to eight hundred million reais. That's obviously associated with the um ramp up in operations. So we expect by the Q one we should be back uh to a more normalized level of accounts receivable, which should be, you know, somewhere between one to one point two billion reis. The deposit amount goes down uh from the Q three to the Q four by about a hundred million reis because as we uh as we return aircraft, um you know we, use some of those uh security deposits as well as uh the answer reserve deposits to cost out uh the returns of the NGs because as you know we're accelerating our transition from the MGs to the masses. And so we're using um those deposits to cost out air property deliveries, which is why, as we said, you know, we do have access access to those deposits as it relates to the to the asset that they're supporting and um and so that's why we include that number in our liquidity. So that that basically there's no external capital raising in there, it's all operational. So the the difference which is around you know that, total number down from four billion to uh three point eight billion, it basically represents an investment in working capital uh spare parts to uh end the year with uh a little over a hundred operating aircraft. Okay. So that okay, that's helpful. So it's it's flattish to slightly down before anything and we know that we're you know, hopefully, capital raising in there if you know we have in addition to that and kind of maybe taking advantage of your question because we have some questions on how we get to the six point one billion of liquidity. Uh in addition to what I described, you know, we have uh potential financing sources of uh based on existing uh unencumbered assets that we have of a little over two billion Ray. And so how we get to the six billion, the additional two billion uh comes out of unencumbered assets. About half of that is the collateral we have uh through the loyalty program. You know, in the Q three we finalized the take in of the loyalty program, so now we control one hundred percent of those assets and the additional collateral uh we have uh in air parks and intellectual property, uh which if we wanted to could be deposited into our senior security oaths program uh to raise additional capital. We have no plans currently uh to do anything with this additional collateral, but it is important to highlight that the unencumbered assets that we have represents a potenti a potential additional two billion R eyes of long term capital should we uh uh choose to pursue that. Okay. Now that's super helpful. And then just um you know you you're always helpful in sort of calling out, you know, the call it the non op operating expenses associated with fleet idleness and personnel related costs and in this quarter, this fourth quarter, it looks like it's just gonna be under a billion Riyes. Now, over the year that number has actually moved up meaningfully despite the fact that you are putting more people and planes back into service. So I don't know, is that is that an FX related issue what's driving that number, or am I just my logic and thinking that as you put more people and planes back to work and that that should go down, that logic's that maybe there's something wrong there and how it's being accounted for. If you could just detail that. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, I think what's uh I think it's a the a depreciation effect, uh Michael, which is a non-cash effect in there. And so uh part of it uh relates to that. Um also, you know, in the Q three uh you know the number in the Q three the number of flights is still reduced. Um and so the substantial ramp up in the um in the Q four. Okay. And uh that will kind of revert back. But in the in the Q three, also in the month of uh September, as you know, we scaled had to scale back a little bit uh given the transition of our PSS uh which impacted our you know, our scale and our our revenues and and our ability to uh improve uh fixed cost solution, you know, because of the migration to the uh to the revenue system which was done in August and um and September. But in the Q three, you know, we had uh uh seventy uh aircraft operated and so we still had sixty aircraft still idle in the Q three. And so what you're seeing there is in in the Q three is the effect of those sixty aircraft um still idle. That number at the end of the Q four will be reduced to you know hopefully less than thirty. Um and and so those those uh you know we we're we're trying to you know separate that out. I think we're one of the few companies that tries to separate that out for you guys in though it's separating the idle cost versus the uh total. Uh but we'll probably only see a normalization on a on a unit cost basis for comparative purposes in the Q one. Because we're still gonna have, you know, idle c idle idle cost in the Q four. Well so now when you say normal in Q one are you are you saying that approaches zero in Q one or I I'm just assuming it gets to zero by the back part of twenty twenty two, but maybe maybe it gets there sooner. Oh no no no no in the in the Q one because again we're you know we've returned aircraft. Uh we are uh th this Q four is uh activation of a majority of the grounded aircraft and as we get into the January, February high season, you know, there might be a little bit in there in the Q four, but for the most part will be eliminated. And then when you get into the the normal seasonality, you know the Q two for us is kind of a down uh seasonality normally. We'll have to see where how the as Kaki said, we could have some positive surprises on the corporate demand uh uh making the Q two of next year a little bit uh better than we might normally see. But uh for us the Q one, because again, you know, we're a hundred percent domestic focused. Uh we don't have wide bodies, we don't depend on the international piece. And you know, the right sizing we did on our capacity and our fleet, if you will, uh should kind of you know triangulate to you know goal being back to more or less normalized uh operating efficiency by end of December, beginning of January. Okay, great. Thanks for that, Rich. Thanks everyone. Oh hey, good morning guys. Um couple questions here. I guess um first another question on the corporate recovery. Big picture, you know, what are you hearing from corporate customers today on their travel plans for next year? And then just related to that, you know, given the FX volatility, I believe there's a certain percent of the revenue that actually benefits from a weaker Brazilian hail. So I'm you know, I'm thinking the oil and gas sectors, I'm thinking agriculture. So it seems like there should be a component of the revenue there that should do a little better um, you know, if the Brazilian hail weekend. But you know, maybe you could clarify or or even correct me on that. the same day we resume flight on January one and i it is somehow attached to their uh home office uh policy which is for the best major valid into the the end of this year. Uh i i when we talk specifically to those statements you have just repeated, uh they are already uh pulling some uh troubles ahead, but this is not even close to the the potential they have told us to the next year on. Uh in a in a side note, the way w we have restructured ourselves to address that specific market via a new passenger service system, the SABR, we will likely give us an additional um uh set of of sales because we can now in in a much more flexible and and fast way uh address some uh uh specific demands raised by the the corporate cycle. So I believe that we we will have the combination of a better product with a redesign network which might uh accelerate the uh the the the the the the the speed uh uh we are now envisioning to to have that to see that segment uh the that specific segment catching up. trying to get at is it it seems like there should be some pent up demand uh next year. And so I guess it just um uh was thinking that there's potentially some more revenue upside here that that folks might be underappreciating. Um but you know going, back to I guess you know a question for Edu or or um is just with respect to that cut over a saber that you just referenced, you know, the ability to market products in a way digitally that you haven't been able to historically. You know, so as you think about the grand vision, you know, what is the f time frame for exploiting that full capability and you know, how material could that be? I think that's gonna be very we're gonna have a hundred percent of the these improvements and enhancements deploy uh until the end of this year and then we will gradually because those are marketing events uh we'll be gradually offering them to the customers along uh two twenty two uh twenty two. Uh it's really really difficult to to g to give you a flavor on how uh material those improvements can be. But we are now basically closing uh every single gap that we could get from a customer service point of view, uh to a a full legacy company at the same time digitally speaking, I mean I I'm talking about digital services. Uh at the same time that we are uh now uh uh resuming the ki the cask advantage that we always had. So I believe that the combination of the two things will uh uh is more than promising, is something that can definitely uh positively affect uh our our results. But I wouldn't like to uh because I couldn't at the moment to to share any any percentage or or or precise numbers on on that expectation. Okay, thanks for the time you guys. Thanks. Let me just uh before we go to the next question on the cell side analyst, uh let me weave in uh a question we have from uh one of our bice investors sending us questions on the platform. And I'll basically do that uh so that we don't have to save the uh people that sent the questions through the platform don't have to wait until the end of this but, we'll come back um to the next uh question from the self side analyst as I go through uh this question from one of our sixtigum investors. Um it has three components on the results. Um please explain what was the write-off of deposits for aircraft leases and uh aircraft uh lease deposits and maintenance reserve deposits. Uh so just to explain that to you to answer your question. In in the cash flow in the quarter and the third quarter, we recognized uh provisions for return of aircraft of 106 176 million reis. Um and against that we uh were able to use and reverted uh one hundred and sixty six million reais of maintenance reserves and then we um reduced um we have a um a um reduction in deposits of two hundred sixty four million reyes. And all this relates to what I was speaking about previously, but it ref refers to uh us maintaining current our maintenance provisions uh for uh the transformation of the fleet from Max's uh Tange. So really it the the provision for the return of aircraft that's in that, and you can see that in the uh in the tables in the back of the release and also in the footnotes of the financial statement is about 176 million rise, which has to be provisioned because you know from an accounting perspective, because we are uh accelerating the return of NGs to maxes. And um we are no longer uh uh constituting any more maintenance reserves uh because we're utilizing deposits, maintenance reserve deposits uh to cross that out, as I mentioned in the previous question. So there's more or less a a hundred percent offset between uh use of maintenance reserves and and what I just mentioned. Within that question as well, there was is what what was the provision for legal proceedings in your cash flow? Uh in the cash flow we have a payment for uh legal proceedings uh in there of about a hundred and fifty million reais related to uh contingencies on PIS and COFINS taxes. Um and then there is in that amount as well, in that legal proceedings line item that you're looking at there uh from the person who asked the question. There are uh other credits that increase 192 million reales that compensate more or less compensate these values uh of these legal proceedings in the same amount. And then the final component of the question in that category, what was the uh what was the reason for the increase in other expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2021, which is basically uh two hundred ninety six million reais versus one hundred sixty seven million reais. And that is a a necessity we had to constitute an increased provision uh for contingencies uh on peace and coin taxes for the importation of aircraft, uh because one of our peers, uh Azul, uh lost uh a process in the amount of lost a lawsuit in the amount of uh 150 million reis and so that forced us to change our perspective from uh a possible loss on that uh discussion uh if those taxes apply to the importation of aircraft to probable. And you know in the uh uh uh in the accounting policies process when it goes to uh probable you then have to constitute uh a provision. But that was based on we have not yet lost the uh discussion with the government, but as one of the our peers did lose the discussion uh that then uh creates the need to increase the amount of uh provision on that. So hopefully that answers your questions on some of those uh details as you're looking at uh those items that are less focused on So. operator we can go back to the um to the um to the call list on the uh south side analyst. And the next question will be from Savvy Fifth with Raymond James. Please go ahead Hey good morning. This is uh Matt on Persavi here. Um either Rich or Kaki. Um if you could regarding the the twenty twenty two uh Cascx outlook, the eight percent reduction versus twenty nineteen. Um, could you give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of capacity production and utilization there? Um also is there is there any change in in the um NG re deliveries or or anything we should consider there? Sorry, if you could r you you're asking about we didn't could you repeat the question? Because I think you were asking about twenty two. Twenty twenty two, right? The case that's okay. So I think it was more so maybe on the you talked about the eight percent reduction in in cask from the fleet. Um I wasn't sure if the the slide, I believe it was twenty three, if that was an early outlook into twenty twenty two or Yeah the the the the max has a lower operating cost than the NGs and so as our aircraft portfolio increases the amount of aircraft that are max um that has a uh effect of reducing our unit costs. The main source of that is the the lower fuel uh consumption. You know we're getting the as advertised, you know, roughly for us it's about sixteen percent less uh fuel consumption. And so I think that's what you're you're asking about then. Okay, certainly that makes that makes sense. I'm sorry, I thought I thought it was uh maybe early looking to to twenty twenty two um on the Cascac side. Is there anything that we should consider though in terms of how you you plan to return to uh your fleet utilization or capacity early looking to twenty twenty two that we should consider? Beyond the field systems there. Yeah, if I understood the question, I mean we'll be back, you know, in our ecosystem, we'll be back to more normalized aircraft utilization numbers in the Q one. Uh you know, which for us is, you know, you know, you know, it should be the sweet spot for us is kind of twelve hours a day of utilization. You know, we expect to be uh back above eleven hours of utilization in the T one. Okay. Thanks, Rich. Um and then if I could on the on the revenue side, versus what you were thinking in Jul in late July last quarter when you provided guidance to now what's in the four key revenue outlook. What has changed? I know you talk looking out into one Q has some corporate segments have come back faster, but that for Q never has gone lower versus late July. So I was wondering what has changed since then. Yeah, sure. I think you know we you know we revised down the revenue forecast for the Q four. Uh it's mainly based on uh lower yi overall yields in the market and um which has a big effect uh just given the uh still situation of uh low uh efficiency and then also and and that's overall market, that's not just us. And then the um and we've been staying out of the way of that um scenario and how we how do we stay out of the way of that? We know we keep capacity uh lower. And so when you combine those effects, you know, us staying out of the way of the low yield environment, given the over capacity uh coming out of competitors uh and adjusting our offer down our our capacity down, you know, those two effects magnify into the reduced uh revenue. Uh but the catalyst is obviously more on the yield side. You know, we have the ability to flex up capacity uh faster if we need to, uh given the amount of aircraft that we have. But you know, we have had a management uh during this twenty months of the pandemic uh focused on two key metrics. One is uh preserving our unit cost advantage uh in the post pandemic environment and also matching our cash inflows with cash outflows and so that limits uh what we can do. Uh and you've seen how we've done that, uh for those of you that are following us, you've seen how we've done that through the pandemic um in terms of uh minimizing any operating uh cash burn. So and how how we do that through the capacity uh equation. If yields are better, we can we can track that up. Now as Kakin mentioned, we're now in the process of reactivating our core uh network, uh which is mainly focused on the business traveler and as as you saw in the slides as well, that shifts our focus from a network perspective from that massive hub we created in Guadalupe managed through the pandemic based on connecting flights, which is not that convenient uh for gold passengers, to going back to uh a more point to point network uh with uh very attractive uh point to point flights out of our other hubs and also from our shuttle markets uh out of uh São Paulo Rio and Brazilia. That's happening as we speak. And so at the goal uh in the goal uh ecosystem that uh can have a significant impact on yields as if if we have some positive surprises on the corpus coming back. I think we'll see that more in the Q one uh because we're still in a transition on that and we're still not back to normalized levels uh on market capacity uh as well as uh demand uh from the the business traveling. Now those effects that you mentioned on the revenue side, obviously they they have the effect on uh EBITDA uh because it means lower scale and so less less fixed cost solution. And so that's why our expectations for Q4 EBITDA are down a bit. The other thing that is in there is um as I was mentioning I think in the in one of the previous questions is an increase in uh CapEx, uh about a two hundred million Rail increase in in CapEx in the Q four. That that mainly relates to investments in uh spare parts inventories and other assets related to reactivation of the operating system. So when you kind of those are the factors, you know, one obviously on the yield uh capacity side and then the other on the CapEx side that account uh for about a uh four hundred million rial reduction in our target of liquidity uh for the end of the Q four, but about half of that number is investment in assets. Like I said, it also has has a side benefit of increasing the uh collateral pool uh that's in our uh secured uh notes program. And those same effects will get you to the uh difference in the leverage. Uh those exact same effects all kind of roll into that. Um and um and and and um and so it's uh it's um it's a it's a transitional uh quarter for us. Um and um uh th there there are there are some s uh exchange rate effects in there, obviously. Uh they kind of run through those calculations and put pressure on it, you know, on the on the on the net net side of the equation also. Um and those result in massive negative exchange rate effects, but those are not economic and don't affect cash flow, just to highlight that 'cause we have gotten some questions on what what are exchange uh and monetary variations, you know, for those that aren't maybe familiar with uh investing in um developing countries with uh weak uh functional currencies. Now our functional currency is real uh therefore um we have to recognize the exchange rate variation on the balance sheet and that produces accounting effects in negative and positive uh you know the exchange uh and monetary uh variations, which continue to be quite large given the uh short term uh negative uh devaluation of the Brazilian real. And so but that for the most part we recommend kind of backing that out, which what we which is what we try to do in our in our um uh uh uh uh uh furnished uh disclosures. Certainly. Well thank thank you very much for all the color there, but really appreciate it and the time. Okay. The next question is from Dwayne Fenigworth with Ebercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Good to speak with you. Um on Fleet, can you just maybe play back uh for us the the Fleet simplification opportunity here? I mean it's not just Macs and and you've outlined those. Uh you did a number of fleet transactions pre COVID, uh you know, short term leases to solve for a gap. Uh then COVID hit. Can can you just help bring us up to speed on on where we are with respect to those shorter term leases rolling off and and what the fleet simplification opportunity is here. Yes. Um yeah we still have a a fair amount of uh NGs on short-term operating leases um where we have you know the optionality of either extending those or returning them the uh the nut there to crack is the availability maxes. Market right now is constrained in terms of the availability maxes, just given that Boeing is still uh only producing uh you know below twenty maxes a day, so still quite low, which is about a third of what they were producing pre uh pandemic. We have all the financing sources lined up to uh add as many maxes as we want to uh in the short term and next year. Uh you know the bottleneck is the availability of uh new maxes. Uh there are still some white bells out there, but they have, you know, significant configuration costs and other issues that um make them less attractive. Now so we have the ability to accelerate the returns of energy based on the structure of our aircraft portfolio, which is which is still to the today a 100% operating lease. And I think another part of the simpliationfic that you're mentioning or that you're hinting at is that what we will do also as we move into the acceleration of the transition from energy to the max, you know, in addition to this, you know, the operating cost benefit based on the lower fuel consumption and and higher higher seat count on those aircraft and so on is the component of uh how we're financing those acquisitions and so we will also be doing more uh finance release uh transactions as you move forward. Uh you know, somewhere in the order of between four and maybe as much as sixteen of those next year um depending on the availability maxes and there's a significant equity value creation that that comes with that. As you saw on the previous cycle when we did forty uh finance leases on the first Rip Boeing, then we created an excess of five hundred million dollars of cash equity uh gains uh through that process and it also gives us equity to borrow gains and things like that. And so the I guess the other component I would say, Dwayne, of that is our ability to sit back in the uh in the game of um uh owning uh a a portion of our fleet. Uh you know and the reason why we're a hundred percent operating at least today is you, know, pre pandemic we had uh uh finalized the monetization of our N G portfolio and we were in the midst of you know, still in the midst of the Mac the max uh grounding. And so we in in that when then the pandemic happened, all that's kind of got pushed out. So we have enormous flexibility to return uh NGs at a faster pace. Um and the bottleneck is the availability maximum to do it. Operationally, you know, we're scaled up, you know, our our operational capacity, you know, on a normalized basis is easily, you know, two aircraft receipts and two re deliveries per month. You know, two in, two out, four total, we can go as high as three per month, um, given our operational uh capability. And so for us it's operational easy easily uh uh done operationally to you know bring in twenty four maxes and and and transition out twenty four NGs next year if we need to do. So uh our our our fleet plan is a little bit less than that and part of it's because we're still in the sourcing of the right maxes uh for that activity. But I think it's important to mention that none of that is going to consume uh our liquidity because we already have the financing uh sources lined up to uh pay for those uh max acquisitions that are in our plan plus some additionals if we need it. We already have the if you will the liability is lined up and we're still working on uh additional sourcing of aircraft. Hopefully that that answers your question. Yeah, listen, it it does. The um the delivery rate you know came up on the Ryanair call as well. Um so I I guess the question would be for the for the deliveries that you've outlined, you know, for the rest of this year and into twenty two, how how many of those are are already built? Um and you know, how does that forecast feel Well in terms of what's coming out of the factory, um we would need you know somewhere between eight to ten aircraft. If it if the source is the factory, if the source is the whitetail market, we've got that covered. And that's that's what we're working on as we speak. Uh the issue with the white tail market is we have some additional reconfiguration costs that we wouldn't have if it was coming out of the factory uh for us. But um but um maybe you can help us convince Boeing to ramp up production to sell more aircraft. Um Um I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't be your guy I wouldn't be your guy for that, but um just I'll sneak one more in here, Rich, um because I'm always interested in your thoughts here. You know, what what FX rate kind of drives the the long term plan and you know for what it's worth you know how how do we get there how do you see the path um to to to that long term rate thank you well um we're not in charge of that, but um the you know, most uh bank market forecasts are for an appreciating real, you know, something with a four handle on it uh at some point next year if you take fair value calculations, our fair value calculations are below four. Um you know we're now twelve months inside of um presidential elections in Brazil. Um and so that uh that is uh gonna be a factor that will maintain volatility high. Um you know we addressed in our presentation on the videos on the website this morning and also in our release, I mean the the Brazil fiscal situation is much better and improving. I mean it's much better than the US uh fiscal situation, for example. And you know, GDP in Q three was up uh four percent. Uh it's around three percent for the for the Q four, uh which is down a little bit. Um but I I I think, you know, my own personal opinion would be you're gonna see weakness in the currency uh because of the political dynamic uh between now and October of next year. Um but um you know going back to Kaky's point, that is gonna keep a relatively captive audience for us for domestic air travel, uh, which is perhaps a silver lining on that, uh which is why we're not um focused today on driving international travel, uh just given the lower purchasing uh power of uh Brazilians and in Reize. And I have to point you to market projections on that because there is it does seem to be a disconnect between the fundamentals of Brazil and the currency which are related to other factors. High oil prices are a are a are a gold uh factor uh for Brazil. Uh you know the raw materials uh sector in Brazil, the extraction economy, which primarily drives the Brazilian economy, has been doing very well during this pandemic. Um and that will create a positive effect in you know and in what other people were asking about in terms of the uh elasticity of the return of corporate travel um in terms of those sectors being uh consumers of air travel. So on the volume side I think the exchange rate is less of an issue. Um it obviously does affect uh cash flow because it pressures both the oil price that we have to pay, which is nine million dollars, as well as the uh uh the aircraft uh costs uh which is not ideal. Uh but it doesn't look like we're gonna be getting any let's say market relief on that anytime soon. Um and uh just given the volatility and you know the the relative perception of the ex you know the outside world on on Brazil. I mean that's that's my two cents on that but we're not the boss of act. Uh you know we're we're price takers on that. Very fair. Thank you. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. The next question is from Alejandro Zamacona with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi Paulo. Hi Richard. Thank you for taking my questions. Um I'm just uh curious on what's your view on the potential recovery uh of the international market uh to pre COVID levels and uh what would be the impact uh on yields amid this uh international market uh reactivation. Hi Alejandro, actually we are not that bullish uh this national market uh recovery for twenty twenty two. There are still uh different uh regulations and different sanitary uh requirements uh which make us uh doubt whether it's gonna be possible to harmonise all of them uh in the first half of the year. So this is one thing. The second is also that uh a a a potential overcapacity will be deployed because you can imagine the total amount of uh white bodies uh available in the world, those have not been those those have not been uh utilised for for I mean many months and and also clearly if there is gonna be when a specific segment being severely affected uh by the the so called uh new normal behaviour, it's gonna be the long haul business trips. Uh I think that this customer will really uh think twice bec before deciding to take a plane for a short uh uh business trip, mainly long haul. So uh honestly I think that generally speaking the international markets will be uh uh uh affected. Uh they are already affected and that effect will will last longer than than expected. So uh by another hand I believe that uh uh long haul leisure travelers will be there and and and mainly for the most important tourist destinations. So but you know how important uh was the the the business trouble pre pandemic for those airlines operating white bodies, business classes, businesses and and and and first class uh I am not that that bullish uh uh about this this specific market demand. Okay, thank you. And then yeah a second question if I may uh on the maintenance. Uh we we saw a significant increase in during this quarter in the maintenance expense. So we were wondering uh what was behind this increase and uh what can we Thank you guys. Yeah, sure. Um the you're asking about the increase in maintenance expenses from the Q two to the Q three from eighty eight million reis to two hundred and forty six million reis. Um that is from and maybe I'll I'll give it I'll give it I'll answer from a different uh perspective. That is related to the acceleration of the transition of the fleet from NGs to MAXs, where we are accelerating the returns of aircraft now over, the next couple months, over the next year. And what you have to do on a quarterly basis is always be fully provisioned on your future re-delivery estimates. And so as we're accelerating now the um the return of the M D's you have we have to top up, we have to increase the amount of provisions uh for maintenance on aircraft. And so in that particular case, th th there there's a certain number of aircraft um in the sea you know, in the mid single digits where um th those provisions increase. That so it's in there, always remember that that that's's you you always have to be estimating if you're doing your accounting properly, and to always ask that question to make sure the companies are provisioning properly their future uh re-delivery costs, you have to always be adjusting your uh provision for that. And for us, you know, the main component of those delivery costs is engine overhauls. And so in our particular case, uh as we increased the number of NGs that were returning and you know the number of maxes that we're bringing in, uh those provisions in the Q3 increase from eighty eight million realis to two hundred and forty six million reis. Okay. Um what I'm gonna do before no sure no no worries. Um we have um one more person in the queue uh uh to ask a question, but before that I'm gonna take another question that we have from the uh platform uh which is asking about yields, RASC and CASC, um two, Q3, Q4, and so I'll just walk through that. Um you know, we had a you know you know fifteen percent increase in yields in the Q three and you know what's implicit in our Q Q fo4ur guidance is basically flat yields versus the Q3. You know, we're being conservative on that given the capacity environment. Um given that we are forecasting load factors up a little bit, that will in in the Q four uh uh is implied um a slight increase in RASC over where we were in the Q three. You know, we did the twenty-six cents in the Q three. We think we could be around something around twenty-eight cents in the Q four. The cost side of the equation, um, you know, the recurring unit costs that we did in the uh in the Q three of uh just under twenty two cents in real, uh in those two four guidance numbers that we provided, um, is a similar level. Uh even though we are, as I was mentioning, increasing the operating fleet and diluting fixed costs, as we return NGs and accelerate transition from the maxes, uh we have a combination of you know higher um expenses for maintenance for the redeliveries higher provisions and also higher uh higher depreciation um And so that that goes to just looking again, yeah, that basically addresses that uh question, uh, which is basically a conservative forecast for the Q4 uh guidance pro wevid'ingre, it's mainly volume driven. It's not being driven out of an increase in yields or a reduction in unit costs. But Saki was mentioning, you know, if if we get a higher el positive elasticity on the business side, that's gonna have a positive impact on yields and you know um could uh translate into uh better revenue numbers for the Q4. With that operator we can go back to the last question in the queue. Okay, I might get one after that. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. This will be the last opportunity for questions for Gaul's management. Hi. My question has actually been answered. Thank you very much. Okay, Matt. Thanks. This concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to invite Mr. Kakanoff to proceed with his closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. I just would like to thank you all very much for the attention. This concludes the GOAL Air Alliance call for today. Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day.",

      "reference" : "<unk> Welcome to the Gol Airlines Third Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. This morning, the company made its numbers available, along with three videos with the results presentation, financial review, and preliminary Q & A. Gol hopes that everyone connected has watched them. After the company's brief remarks, we will initiate the Q & A session, when further instructions will be provided. This event is also being broadcast live via webcast, and may be accessed through the company website at www.voegol.com .vr\/ir and on the MZIQ platform at www.mziq.com. Those following the presentation via the webcast may post their questions on the platform, and their questions will either be answered by the management during this call, or by the Gol Investor Relations Team after the conference is finished. Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Gol's management and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors and analysts should understand that events related to macroeconomic conditions, industry, and other factors could also cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. At this time, I will hand you over to Mr. Paul Kakinoff, CEO. Please begin. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Gol Airlines Quarterly Earnings Call. I would like to start by highlighting our most important achievements of this spirit. The first one was the continued recovery in demand, which showed solid growth during the third quarter. At the end of September, Brazil became fourth among all countries with the most vaccines administered against COVID-19. Approximately 56% of Brazil's population is fully vaccinated, and over 74% have received their first dose, a higher percentage than the vast majority of the countries, including the United States. Similar to demand trends in other markets, the rising vaccination rate in the general population is supporting the air markets' ongoing recovery. As a result, Gol's departures in the third quarter grew by 87%, reaching 52% of the levels in 2019. In response to this demand, Gol is expanding its network, and has already announced a new route from Congoines to Bonito. It's starting in this December. We are taking a conservative approach to increasing capacity as travel demand recovers to help maintain high load factors and profitability in our routes. The second important event was a transition of the fleet to Boeing Max 8. In preparation for this strong recovery in air travel that we expect to see in the coming quarters, we sign agreements to accelerate the transformation of our fleet, with the acquisition of 28 additional Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. This initiative is expected to reduce the company's unit cost by 8% in 2022. Because of the new contract, we will end 2021 with 28 new Max Aircraft, which represents 20% of the fleet. By the end of 2022, we expect to have 44 Max Aircraft, raising this total to 32%. With purchase commitments, we will meet our 2030 goal of having 75% of the fleet in this new aircraft. And, as is widely recognized, the Max is 15% more fuel- efficient, generates 60% less carbon emissions, and is 40% quieter compared to the MG. This aircraft has positioned us to grow even more competitively, expanding routes to new destinations and providing efficiency gains, all of which will capture more value for all our stakeholders. The full important achievement was the conclusion of the merger with MIOS into GLE. This transaction will generate great value from several operation synergies, as well as new opportunities and strategies that will become even more significant during the airline market recovery. We're optimistic that the synergies from this corporate reorganization, expected to be approximately $3 billion reais in net present value for the next five years, and the subsequent values to our shareholders will be realized in a relatively short period of time. With that, I will hand the floor over to Richard, our CFO, who will present some financial highlights. Thank you, Kak. Our most recent notable event was the success of our liability management program. In September, we issued $150 million in a re-tap at 8% annual interest rate on our senior secured notes, maturing in 2026. Moody's assigned the notes a rating of B2. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including aircraft acquisitions and working capital. In October, we re-financed our short-term bank debt, in the amount of $1.2 billion reais by an extension of the seventh series of debentures and the issuance of our eighth series of simple, non-convertible debentures. This re-financing enabled the company to return to its lowest level of short-term debt since 2014 at about a half a billion reais, which will also improve Gol's credit metrics by better matching future assets and liabilities, and reducing the average cost of debt. Our next relevant maturity date for outstanding debt is not until July 2024. Gol's balance sheet is now in a better position in terms of our outstanding debt, versus our peers, which we view to be a competitive advantage in the current market environment. In addition, the company advertised around $518 million reais of debt in this quarter, the average maturity of Gol's long-term debt, excluding aircraft leases and perpetual notes, is approximately 3.4 years, with the mean obligations already addressed in our cash flow. The net debt ratio, excluding exchangeable notes and perpetual bonds, to adjusted last twelve months we've adopted, was 9.7 times on September 30, 2021, representing the lowest financial leverage among peers. Considering the amounts fundable from deposits and unencumbered assets, the company's potential sources of liquidity resulted in approximately $6.1 billion reais of accessible liquidity. The recent capitalization of the balance sheet, with capital increase led by the majority shareholder, represented the recognition of Gol's value as Brazil's largest airline with the best product. The re-financing of our short-term bank debt in October, added to long-term capital of $2.7 billion reais raised in the second and third quarters of this year, totals over $3.9 billion reais in the last seven months. As far as a discussion of financial results for the quarter, it was shared this morning in the video presentation, and we believe you all had a chance to access that. In short, our work to re-establish operating margins that can support the sustained growth of operations is bearing fruit. We ended the third quarter with an EBIT reaching $330 million reais and an operating margin totalling 17.7%. Concurrently, adjusted EBITDA $446 million reais with a 24.3% margin, evidencing our successful efforts at matching supply and demand. I will now return back over to Kakinoff. Thanks Richard. We have seen a recovery in demand for air travel, and we believe that now, with greater population immunization, and the significant expansion of vaccination, we will have a strong fourth quarter, coinciding with the start of the summer season. I would like to close by thanking our employees, the team of RIGOS, who are working with extreme professionalism and commitment. All this adaption puts us in a solid position to expand operations and achieve profitable growth. We reiterate our confidence that Gol will re-emerge as strong and even more resilient as markets normalize. Now, I would like to initiate the Q & A session. Thank you.

You need to click on the? In the upper-left hand corner and type in your question. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Steven Trent with Citi. Please go ahead. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks very much for taking my questions. I just kind of wanted, you know, your high-level views on international demand to the U.S. spooling up again. You know, now that you're partnered with American Airlines, you know, what sort of bigger opportunities are you seeing on the horizon, and do you see any opportunity as well for American to possibly increase its stake in Gol in some point in the future? Hi Steven, Kakinoff here, good morning. Thank you very much for your question. Let me give you an overview on the North American market specifically. Uh, firstly you know we are, uh, now gradually reaching our international goals. So we have already made available the ticket sales for Cancun in Mexico, Dominicans, for the Dominican Republic, and we are now resuming Montevideo and Buenos Aires. So, the United States, uh, will be likely the route to be added in our international portfolio by the end of the second quarter of next year. And it is because, you're right, with the borders are now open to the Brazilians, but, and there is a considerable but, which is, uh, the, the, the, default, the exchange rate made, made the purchase, the ticket purchase and the whole trip cost, including hotels, train and car expense, pretty expensive from the Brazilian perspective. Uh, you know the real has the devaluated quite significantly along the last quarter, so the Brazilian economic conditions, uh, also, was, uh, were affected during the, the last three months. And the combination of a real excitement to resume international trips has a great contrast with the important constraint imposed by the exchange rate. So the passengers are willing to fly, mainly to the United States, but that, that trip became quite, quite expensive at the moment. So, uh, I cannot say there is a boom related to North American ticket, to, related to airline tickets, uh, to fly to the United States. Uh, you know, we are about to begin the Brazilian high season, December and January. And uh, typically, that's the period when you see more passengers willing to travel for leisure purpose. It is not going to be different this year, maybe it's slightly better for the international markets. And the second constraint, which is also affecting demand, is that there is a backlog to provide North American visas to the Brazilians, which we will not be, uh, solved, or rather addressed in the forecast. So if you have five members… a family of five members, uh, it's very much likely that at least one of them has no valid visa, uh, at the moment, making not possible to, to fly to the United States. So all those things combined, uh, are affecting the potential, uh, uh, flight catch-up that we could get, if not by this, this, two constraints, and finally in our case, we have the partnership with American Airlines, who has already deployed a, a considerable capacity increase for the following three months. So we have decided to support, uh, that investment by selling, not the American Airlines tickets in our channels, as we done already since April 2020, uh, and to that strategy we are simultaneously attending our customers and, uh, supporting this additional capacity increase supplied by American Airlines, our partner. So we believe that, this is the, the best strategy to cope with the current demand, and then we will, uh, resume our out flight from Brasilia to Florida, uh, where a market which has not been attended by American Airlines at the moment from the second quarter next year on. So, this is, I mean, an overview of the North American market from the Brazilian perspective in the airline segment. Super Kaki, really appreciate that. And, and, just very quickly, just one last thing, uh. On business travel, any high-level trends you're seeing in the domestic market? And let me leave it at that, thank you. We, uh, we might be surprised by the speed, uh, to which the business segment is recovering the, uh, the, uh, its pre-pandemic level. We are now verifying that, and identifying, actually, that some specific segments in Brazil is catching up its business-… is, u- uh, catching up, uh, its business travel behavior. Uh, even above the, the pre-pandemic level, those are the services, y- uh, generally speaking. Uh, mainly those, those companies pretty much, uh, uh, uh, benefited by, by the new customer behavior. So like food delivery, just say, uh, uh, one example, and, and E-commerce, so those segments, uh, of Boeing. And they are probably <laugh> more than they were, uh, before, th- uh, the pandemic. And also, uh, some i- if I could say so, some other traditional segments, uh, those are pretty strong in, in Brazil. Uh, such as the agricultural business, oil and gas, and inaudible industries. So we, we foresee that by the beginning of the next year, we might be above our prior projection, which has… Consider that one-third of the business travelers would be gone for good, which might be not the case. So i- i- it, it's, it's too early to be precise, uh, u- uh, on that projection, but, uh, at this, this moment, we see that some, uh, segments are recovering faster than the next sector. Great. Thank you very much, Khaki. Thank you. The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Oh, yeah, hey. Good morning, everybody. Um, I wanna just, um, kinda run through liquidity, and I wanna make sure I'm sorta comparing apples to apples here. So, Sep 2, your total liquidity, it looked like it ended at 2.1 billion reais, and you're guiding to 3.8 at year-end. Is that, um, Rich, is that predominantly the American Airlines investment and an improvement, or an increase in your ATL? Or is there other things we should be mindful of? Yeah, no, the… You know, any, any transaction that's not closed is not in those numbers. So that, that is not in those numbers, Michael, nor is new additional, uh, capital reason. Um, the, the Q3 number, uh, and I'll, I'll walk you through that. Q3 number which was composed of the, the 4 billion reais that you mentioned, which is about, uh, 1.1 billion of cash investments, about 300 million reais of restricted cash, about 600 million reais of accounts receivable, and 1.9 billion reais of deposits. Uh, the way that would break down in the Q4 would be about ni- uh, uh, 900 to a billion reais of cash and investments, about th- uh, which is down around, uh, 200 million reais. Because as we ramp up, uh, to the high season and get our fleet back up above 100 operating aircraft, we're investing in working capital, spare parts, if you will, to, um, uh, get all these aircraft up and flying. So that, that's effectively going into, uh, assets, uh, but it's obviously consuming some liquidity. And to some extent, it's also increasing our spare parts inventory which, uh, supports the collateral in our Senior Secured Notes program. Uh- Uh- The restricted cash, uh, will be a similar balance of around 300 million reais. Uh- Yep, yep. Accounts receivable, accounts receivable increases, about 200 million reais to 800 million reais. That's obviously associated with the, um, ramp up in operations. You know, we expect that by Q1, we should be back, uh, to a more normalized level accounts receivable, which would be, you know, somewhere between 1 to 1.2 billion reais. Okay. The deposit amount, the deposit amount goes down, uh, from the Q3 to the Q4 by about 100 million reais. Because as we, uh, as we return aircraft, uh, you know, we use some of those, uh, security deposits as well as, uh, the inaudible deposits to cost out, uh, the return inaudible. 'Cause u- if you know, we're accelerating our transition from the MGs to the masses, and so we're using, um, those deposits to cost out aircraft re-deliveries. Which is why as we said, you know, we do have axos- access to those deposits as it relates to the, to the asset that they're supporting. And, um, and so that's why we include that number in our liquidity. So that, that basically, there's no external capital raising in there, it's all operational. So the, the difference, which is- Oh- Around you know, that total number down from 4 billion to, uh, 3.8 billion. It basically represents an investment in working capital, uh, spare parts, to, uh, end the year with, uh, a little over 100 operating aircraft. Okay. So that, okay, that's helpful. So it's, it's flat-edged, to slightly down, before anything, and we know that we're… You know, hopeful that- Well, you know, the crosstalk capital raising in there. As you know, we have, in addition to that, and kinda maybe taking advantage of your question. 'Cause we have some questions on how do we get to the 6.1 billion of liquidity. Uh, in addition to what I described, you know, we have, uh, potential connecting sources of, uh, based on inaudible, uh, unencumbered assets that we have of a little over 2 billion reais. And so how we get to the 6 billion, the additional 2 billion, uh, comes out of unencumbered assets. About half of that is the collateral we have, uh, through the loyalty program. You know, in the Q3 we finalized the take in of the loyalty program, so we control 100% of those assets and the additional collateral, uh, we had, uh, in spare parts, in all actual property. Uh, which if we wanted to could be deposited into our Senior Secure Notes program, uh, for raising additional capital. We have no plans currently, uh, to do anything with this additional collateral. But it is important to highlight that the unencumbered assets that we have represents a potish- a potential additional 2 billion reais of long-term capital, should we, uh, uh, choose to pursue that. Okay, now that's super helpful. And then, just, um… You know, you, you're always helpful in sorta calling out, you know, the call it, the non o- operating expenses associated with fleet idleness and personal related costs. And in this quarter, this fourth quarter, it looks like it's just gonna be under a billion reais. Now, over the year, that number has actually moved up meaningfully, despite the fact that you are putting more people and planes back into service. So I don't know, is that, is that an FX related issue, what's driving that number? Or am I just, my logic in thinking that as you put more people and planes back to work, and that that should go down. That, that logic's… That maybe there's something wrong there and how it's being accounted for. If you could just detail that. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, I think what you, I think it says a depreciation affect, uh, Michael, which is a non cash affect in there. Okay. Um, but let me, let me, let me get back to that because that's a more technical calculation. But obviously in that, you know, in the unit cost, uh, is the depreciation. And so, uh, part of it, uh, relates to that. Um, also, you know, in the Q3, uh, you know the number… In the Q3, the number of flights is still reduced. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and so there's a, there's a substantial ramp up in the, um, in the Q4. Okay. And, uh, that will kinda revert back. But in the, in the Q3, also in the month of, uh, September as you know, we sc- had to scale back a little bit, uh, given the transition of our PSS. Uh, which in fact did our, you know, our scale, and our, our revenues, and, and our ability to, uh, improve, uh, inaudible pollution, you know, because of the migration to the, uh, new revenue system which was done in August and, um, and September. But in, in the Q3, you know, we had, uh, uh, 70, uh, aircraft operators. And so we still had 60 aircraft still idle in the Q3. And so what you're seeing there is, in, in the Q3, is the effect of those 60 aircraft, um, still idle. Uh, that number at the end of the Q4 will be reduced to, you know, hopefully less than 30. Uh- Nom- And, and so those, those, uh, you know… And we're, we're trying to, you know, separate that out. I think we're one of the few companies that tries to separate that our for you guys. You know, we're separating the idle costs versus the, um, total. Uh, but we'll probably only see a normalization on a, on a unit cost basis for comparative purposes in the Q1. 'Cause we're still gonna have, you know, idle c- idle, idle costs in the Q4. What's, uh, now… When you say normal in Q1, are you, are you saying that approaches zero in Q1? Or, I, I'm just assuming it gets to zero by the back part of 2022. But maybe, maybe it gets there sooner? Oh, no, no, no, no. In the, in the Q1 it goes again, we're, you know, we've returned aircraft. Uh, we are, uh, thi- this Q4 is, uh, activation of a majority of the grounded aircraft. And as we get into the January, February high season, you know, we might be a little bit in there in the Q4, but, uh, for the most part, we'll be eliminated. Now that you get into the, the normal season out, you know, Q2 for us is kind of a down, uh, seasonality normally. We'll have to see where Aldi… In fact, he said, we could have some positive surprises on the corporate demand- mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, uh, making the Q2 of next year a little bit, uh, better than we might normally see. But, uh, for us, the Q1, because again, you know, we're 100% domestic focused. And we don't have inaudible. We don't depend on the international piece. And you know, the right size that we did on our capacity, on our fleet if you will, uh, should kind of, you know, triangulate to, you know, going back to more or less normalize the operating efficiency by end of December, beginning of January. Okay, great. And thanks for that, Rich. Thanks, everyone. Sure. The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Oh, hey. Good morning, guys. Um, couple questions here. I guess, um, first, another question on the corporate recovery. Big picture, you know, what are you hearing from corporate customers today on their travel plans for next year? And then just related to that, you know, given the FX volatility, I believe there's a certain percent of the revenue that actually benefits from a weaker Brazilian real. So I'm, you know, I'm thinking the oil and gas sectors. I'm thinking agriculture. So it seems like there should be a component of the revenue there that should do a little better, um, you know, if the Brazilian real weakens. But you know, maybe you could clarify or, or even correct me on that? Yeah. Um, just… Firstly, the, uh, the, the customers inaudible. The, the large corporates, uh, they are basically saying they will resume flights from January 1. And it, it, it is somehow affected to their, uh, home office, uh, policy, which is for inaudible right into the, the end of this year. Uh, th- i- i- i- when we talk, it's specifically to those segments that have just repeated. Uh, they are already, uh, forming some travels ahead, but this is not even close to the, the potential they have for this, to the next year up. Uh, in a, in a side note, uh, really what we have is circular itself, to address that a specific month, via a new inaudible, will likely give us an additional, um, uh, set of inaudible. Because we can now, an- and they're much more flexible, and, uh, and inaudible. Uh, as well some, uh, uh, specific demands rated by the, the corporate cycle. So with the new, you have the combination of a better product with a redesigned network, with much, uh, activity, wh- uh, uh, uh, uh, the speed. Uh, we are now envisioning to, to have that t- to see that segment, uh, that, that specific segment catching up. Hm, yeah. But it d- I guess… Go ahead. I'm sorry, Rich. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. inaudible No, go ahead. Sorry, go. Uh, u- well, I guess, just tied to that point. I guess what I was, you know, trying to get at is, it, it seems like there should be some pent up demand, uh, next year. And so, I guess I just, um, uh, was thinking that there's potentially some more revenue upside here that, that folks might be under-appreciating. Um, but you know, going back to, I guess, you know, a question for Adu. Or, or, um, is just with respect to that inaudible that you just referenced. You know, the ability to market products in a way, digitally, that you haven't been able to historically. You know, so if you think about the grand vision, you know, what is the f- timeframe for exploiting that full capability? And you know, how material could that be? I think that it's gonna be… We have, or we are gonna have 100% of the, the improvements. I mean, inaudible, uh, to the end of this year. And that will be aggressive because those are marketing events. Uh, it will be inaudible customers around 80,000 to inaudible. Uh, it's really, really difficult to g- to give you a inaudible on how, uh, material those improvements can be. But we are now basically closing every single gap that we could get from a customer service point of view, uh, to a, a full legacy company. At the same t- additionally speaking, I mean, uh, I'm talking about digital service. Uh, at the same time that we are, uh, now u- uh, resuming the c- uh, the inaudible advantage that we always had. So I believe that a combination of inaudible we will… Uh, it's more than promising. It's something that, um, has a real, uh, positive affect, uh, our, our results. But I wouldn't like to, uh, because I couldn't at the moment, uh, to share any, any inaudible, um, on that expectation. Okay. Thanks for the time you guys. Thanks. Let me just, uh… Before we go to the next question on the sell side analysts, uh, let me weave in a question we have from, uh, one of our Brightside investors sending us questions on the platform. And I'll basically do that, uh, so that we don't have to save the, uh… People that sent the questions through the platform don't have to wait to the end of this. But we'll come back, um, in the next, uh, question from the sell side analysts after I go through, uh, this question from one of our inaudible investors. Um, it has three components on the results. Um, it explained what was the right off of deposits for aircraft leases, and… Uh, u- air- uh, aircraft lease deposits and maintenance and drift deposits. Uh, so just, uh, explain that to you, to an- to answer your question. In, in the cash flow in the quarter, in the third quarter, we recognized, uh, provisions for return of aircraft. There were 106… 176 million reais. Um, and against that, we, uh, were able to use and reverted, uh, 166 million reais of maintenance reserves. And then we-… 56 million reals of maintenance reserves. And then we, um, reduced, um… we have a, um, a, um, reduction in deposits of 264 million reals. And all this relates to what I was speaking about previously, but it ref- refers to, uh, us maintaining current, our maintenance provisions, uh, for, uh, the transformation of the fleet from MAXes, uh, to inaudible. So, really the, the provision for the, the front of aircraft, it's in that, and you can see that in the, uh, in the tables in the back of the release, and also in the footnote to the financial statement. There's about 176 million reals, which has to be provisioned because, you know, from an accounting perspective, because we are, uh, accelerating return of inaudible to the MAXes. And, um, we are no longer, uh, uh, constituting anymore maintenance reserves, uh, because we're utilizing deposits, inaudible or deposits, uh, to swap that out, as I mentioned in the previous question. So there is more or less a 100% offset between, uh, use of maintenance reserves, and, and what I just mentioned. Within that question, as well, there was, is what, what was the provision for legal p- proceedings in your cash flow. Uh, in the cash flow we have, uh, payment for, uh, legal proceedings, uh, in there of about 150 million reals related to, uh, contingencies on inaudible and inaudible, uh, taxes. Um, and then there is amount, amount as well in that legal proceedings line out on that you're looking at there, uh, from the person that asked the question, there are, uh, other credits that increased 192 million reals that compensate, almost compensate these values, uh, of these legal proceedings in the same amount. And then the final component of the question in that category, what was the, uh, what was the reason for the increase in other expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2021, which is basically, uh, 296 million reals versus 167 million reals. And that is a, the necessity we had to constitute an increased provision, uh, for contingencies, uh, on inaudible and inaudible taxes for the importation of aircraft. Uh, because one of our peers, uh, Azul, uh, lost, uh, a process in the amount of, inaudible mostly to the amount of, uh, 150 million reals. And so that forced us to change our perspective from, uh, a possible loss on that, uh, discussion, uh, if those taxes applied to the importation of aircraft to probable. And, you know, in the, in, uh, in the accounting policies process, when it goes to, uh, probable, you then have to constitute, uh, a provision. But that was based on, we have not yet lost the, uh, discussion with the government, but as one of the, our peers did lose the discussion, uh, that then, uh, creates the, the ne- need to increase the amount of, uh, provision on that. So hopefully that answers your questions on some of those, uh, details as you're looking at, uh, those items that are less focused on software. We can go back to the, um, to the, um, to the call list on the, uh, inaudible. And the next question will be from Savi Syth with Raymond James, please go ahead. Hey, good morning. This is, uh, inaudible for Savi here. Um, either Rich or Kaki. Um, if you could, regarding the, the 2022, uh, inaudible outlook, the 8% reduction versus 2019. Um, can you give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of capacity production and utilization there? Um, also is there, is there any change in, in the, um, NGV deliveries or, or anything we should consider there? Sorry, if you could re- you're, you're asking about, we didn't… could you repeat the question? Because I think you were asking about ' 22 crosstalk- 2022, right? The inaudible. Okay, so I think it was more so maybe on the, you talked about a 8% reduction in, in caps from the fleet. Um, I wasn't sure if the, the slide, I believe it was 23, if that was- Okay. You're talking about crosstalk. an early outlook into 2022, or… crosstalk. Yeah, the, the, the, the MAX has a lower operating cost than the inaudible, and so as our aircraft portfolio increases, the amount of aircraft that are a MAX, um, that has a, uh, effect of reducing our duty cost. The main source of that is the, the lower fuel, uh, consumption. You know, we're getting the as advertised, you know, roughly, for us, it's about 16% less, uh, fuel consumption. And so I think that's what you're, you're asking about inaudible. Okay, certainly, that makes, that makes sense. I'm sorry, I thought, thought it was a maybe a early look into, to 2022, um, on the inaudible side. Is there anything that we should consider, though, in terms of how you, you plan to return to, uh, your fleet utilization? Or, or capacity early looking to 2020 what we should consider? Beyond the, the fleet crosstalk? Uh, if I understood the question… Yeah, if I understood the question, I mean, we'll be back, you know, in our ecosystem we'll be back to more normalized aircraft utilization numbers into Q1. Uh, you know, which for us is, you know, you know, you know, it should be a sweet spot for us. It's kind of 12 hours a day of utilization. You know, we expect to be, uh, back above 11 hours of utilization into Q1. Okay. Thanks, Rich. Um, and then if I could, on, on the revenue side, versus what you were thinking in j- in late July, last quarter when you provided guidance to now what's in the 4Q revenue outlook, what has changed? I know you talk at, uh, looking out in the 1Q, how, some corporate segments have come back faster, but that 4Q number has gone lower versus late July. So I was wondering what has changed since then. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I think, you know, we re- you know, revised down the revenue forecast for the Q4. Uh, it's mainly based on, uh, lower y- overall yields in the market. And, um, which has a big effect, uh, just given the, uh, still situation of, uh, low, uh, efficiency. And then also, and, and that's overall market, that's not just us. And then the, um, and we've been staying out of the way of that, um, scenario. And how we, how do we stay out of the way of that? We, know, we keep capacity, uh, lower. And so when you combine those effects, you know, it's staying out of the way of the low yield environment, given the overcapacity, uh, coming out of competitors, uh, and adjusting our offer down, or capacity down. You know, those two effects magnify into the reduced, uh, revenue. Uh, but the catalyst is obviously more on the yield side. You know, you know, we have the ability to flex up capacity, uh, fast if we need to, uh, given the amount of aircraft that we have. But, you know, we have had a management, uh, during this 20 months of the pandemic, uh, focused on two key metrics. One is, uh, preserving our unit cost advantage, uh, in the post-pandemic environment, and also matching our cash inflows with cash outflows. And so that limits, uh, what we can do. Uh, and you've seen how we've done that, uh, for those of you that have followed us, you've seen how we've done that through the pandemic, um, in terms of, uh, minimizing a- any operating, uh, cash burn. So, and how, and how, we do that through the capacity, uh, equation. If yields are better we can, we can inaudible. But, as Kaki mentioned, we're now in the process of reactivating our core, uh, network, uh, which is mainly focused on the business traveler. And, as- Hmm. as you saw in the slides as well, that shifts our focus from a network perspective from that massive hub we created in inaudible, we managed through the pandemic based on connecting flights, which was not that convenient, uh, for inaudible passengers to going back to, uh, a more point to point network, uh, with a very attractive, uh, point to point flights out of our other hubs, and also from our inaudible, uh, out of, uh, Sao Paolo, Rio, and Brazilian. That's happening as we speak. And so, at the goal, uh, in the goal, uh, ecosystem that, uh, it can have a significant impact on yields as, if, if we have some positive surprises on the corporates coming back. I think we'll see that more on the Q1, uh, because we're still in a transition on that. And we're still not back to normalized levels, uh, on market capacity, uh, as well as, uh, demand, uh, from the, the business traveler. And also the fact that you mentioned on the revenue side, obviously they, they have the effect on, uh, inaudible, uh, because it needs lower scale, and so less, less fixed cost inaudible. And so that's why our expectations for Q4 EBIT are down a bit. The other thing that is in there is, um, as I was mentioning, I think in the, in one of the previous questions, is an increase in, uh, CapEx. Uh, a- about a 200 million real increase in, in CapEx, into Q4. That, that mainly relates to investments in, uh, spare parts inventories. And other assets related to, uh, reactivation of the operating inaudible. And so, when you kinda, those are the factors, you know, one obviously on the yield, uh, capacity side, and them the other, like, CapEx side that account, uh, for about a, uh, a quarter million re- real reduction in our targeted liquidity, uh, for the end of Q4. But about half of that number is investment in assets. Like I said it also has, has a side benefit of increasing the, uh, collateral pool, uh, that's in our, uh, secured, uh, notes program. And those same effects will get you to the, uh, difference in the leverage. Uh, those exact same effects all kind of rolled into that. Um, and, um, and, you know, and, and, um, and so it's, uh, it's, um, it's a, it's a transitional, uh, quarter for us. Um, and, um… uh, there, there, there were, there were some s- uh, exchange rate effects in there, obviously. Uh, they kind of run through those calculations and put pressure on it, you know, on the, on the, on the net, net side of the equation also. Um, and those result in massive negative exchange rate effects, but those are not economic and don't affect the cash flow, just to highlight that. 'Cause we have gotten some questions on- Right. what it, what are exchange, uh, and monetary variations, you know, for those that aren't maybe familiar with, uh, investing in, um, developing countries with, uh, weak, uh, functional currencies. And our functional currency is real, uh, therefore, um, we have to recognize the exchange rate variation on the balance sheet, and that produces accounting effects in negative and positive, uh, you know, exchange, uh, in monetary, uh, variations. Which continue to be quite large, given the, uh, short term, uh, negative, uh, devaluation of the Brazilian real. And so, but that, for the most part, we recommend kind of backing that out, which what we, wh- which is what we try to do in our, in our, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, furnished, uh, disclosure. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Certainly. Well, thank, thank you very much, uh, for the color there, Rich. I really appreciate it, and your time. Okay. The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Good to speak with you. Um, on fleet, can you just maybe play back, uh, for us the, the fleet simplification opportunity here? I mean, it's not just MAX, and, and you've outlined those. Uh, you did a number of fleet transactions pre-Covid, uh, you know, short term leases to solve for a gap. Uh, then Covid hit. Ca, can you just help bring us up to speed on, on where we are with respect to those shorter term leases rolling off, and, and what the fleet simplification opportunity is here. Yes. Um, yeah, we still have a, a fair amount of, uh, inaudible on short term operating leases. Um, where we have, you know, the optionality of either extending those or returning them. The, uh, the nut there to crack is the availability of MAXes. Market right now is constrained in terms of the availability of MAXes, just given that Boeing is still, uh, only producing a, you know, below 20 MAXes a day. So it's still quite low, which is about a third of what they were producing pre- uh, pandemic. We have all the financing sources lined up to, uh, as, as many MAXes as we want to, uh, in the short term, and next year. Uh, you know, the bottleneck is the availability of, uh, new MAXes. Uh, there are still some white tails out there, but they have, you know, significant configuration costs and other issues that, um, make them less attractive now. So we have the ability to accelerate the, uh, returns of inaudible based on the structure of our aircraft portfolio, which is, which still to- today at 100% operating lease. Um, and I think another part of this implication that you're mentioning, or, that you're hinting at, is that what we'll do also, as we move into the acceleration of the transition from the inaudible to the MAX… inaudible to this, you know, the operating cost benefit based on the lower fuel consumption and, and higher, higher seat count on those aircraft and so on, is the component of, uh, how we're financing those acquisitions. And so we will also be doing more, uh, finance lease, uh, transactions as we move forward. Uh, you know, somewhere in the order of between four, and maybe as much as 16 of those next year, um, depending on the availability of MAXes. And there's a significant equity value creation that, that comes with that, as you saw y- on the previous cycle when we did 40, uh, inaudible on first order with Boeing, and we've created an excess of $500 million in cash equity, uh, gains, uh, through that process. And it also gives us equity to borrow against the things like that. So the, I guess the other component I would say, Duane, of that is our ability to get back in the, uh, in the game of, um, uh, owning a, a, a portion of our fleet. Uh, you know, uh, t- the reason why we're 100% operating lease today is, you know, pre-pandemic, we had, uh, uh, finalized the inaudible of our inaudible portfolio, and we were in the midst of, you know, still in the midst of the MAX, the MAX, uh, grounding. And so we, i- in that, and then the pandemic happened, all that's kinda got pushed out. So we have enormous flexibility to return, uh, inaudible at a faster pace. Um… Achieved at a faster pace. Um, and the bottleneck uses the availability of MAXes to do it. Operationally, you know, we're scaled up. You know, our- our operational capacity, you know, on a normalized basis is easily, you know, two aircraft receipts and two re-deliveries per month. You know, two in, two out, four total. We can go as high as three per month, um, given our operational, uh, capability. And so for us it's operational eas- easily, uh, done operationally to, you know, bring in 24 MAXes and- and- and transition out 24 NTs make sure if we need to do. So, uh, our- our- our flew fund is a little bit less than that and part of it's because we're still in the sourcing of the right MAXes, uh, for that activity. But, I think it's important to mention that none of that is gonna consume, uh, our liquidity because we already have the financing, uh, sources lined up to, uh, pay for those, uh, MAX acquisitions that are in our plan, plus some additional in case we need it. We already have the issue of the liability is lined up and we're still working on, uh, additional sourcing of aircraft. Hopefully that- that answers your question. Yeah, listen, it- it does. The, um, the delivery rate, you know, came up on the Ryanair call as well. Um, so I- I guess the question would be for the, for the deliveries that you've outlined, you know, for the rest of this year and into ' 22, how- how many of those are- are already built? Um, and, you know, how does that forecast feel relative to kind of the delivery rate that you're, um, that you're seeing? Well, in terms of what's coming out of the factory, um, we would need, you know, somewhere between eight to 10 aircraft, if it, if the source is the factory. If the source is the white tail market, we've got that covered. And, that's- that's what we're working on as we speak. Uh, because… And the issue with the white tail market is we have some additional reconfiguration costs that we wouldn't have if it was coming out of the factory, uh, for us. But, um, but, um, maybe you can help us convince Boeing to ramp up production to sell more aircraft. Um- <laugh> I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be your-… Okay. guy, I wouldn't be your guy for that. But, um, just I'll speak one more in here Rich, um, because I'm always interested in your thoughts here. You know, what- what FX rate kinda drives the- the long term plan and, you know, for what it's worth, you know, ho- how do we get there? How do you see the path, um, to- to- to that long term rate? Thank you. Well, um, we're not in charge of that. But, um, the, you know, most, uh, bank market forecasts are for an appreciating rial, you know, something with a fore handle on it, uh, at some point next year. If you take fair value calculations, our fair value calculations are below four. Um, you know, we're now 12 months inside of, um, presidential elections in Brazil. Um, and so that, uh, that is, uh, gonna be a factor that will maintain volatility high. Um, you know, we addressed in our presentation, in the videos on the website this morning and also in our release, I mean, the- the Brazil fiscal situation is much better and improving. It's much better than the US, uh, fiscal situation, for example. And, you know, TDP in Q3 was up, uh, four percent. Uh, it's around three percent for the, for the Q4, uh, which is down a little bit. Um, but I- I- I think, you know, my own personal opinion would be you're gonna see weakness in the currency, uh, because of the political dynamic, uh, between now and October of next year. Um, but, um- um, you know, I'm going back to that ease point, that is gonna keep a relatively captive audience for us for domestic air travel, uh, which is perhaps the silver lining on that. Uh, which is why we're not, um, focused today on driving international travel, uh, just given the little purchasing, uh, power of, uh, Brazilians in- in red eyes. And I'd have to point you to market projections on that because inaudible it does seem to be a disconnect between the fundamentals of Brazil and the currency which are related to other factors. High oil prices are a, are a, are a bull, uh, factor, uh, for Brazil. Uh, you know, the raw materials, uh, sector of Brazil, the extraction economy, which primarily drives the Brazilian economy has been doing very well during this pandemic. Um, and that will create a positive effect in, you know, in- in what other people were asking about in terms of the, uh, elasticity of the return of corporate travel, um, in terms of those sectors being, uh, consumers of air travel. So on the volume side, I think the exchange rate is less of an issue. Um, but obviously does effect, uh, cash flow because it pressures both the oil price that we have to pay which now a million dollars, as well as the, uh- uh, the aircraft, uh, costs, uh, which is not ideal. Uh, but it doesn't look like we're gonna be getting any, let's say market relief, on that any time soon. Um, and, uh, just given the volatility and, you know, the- the relative perception of the ex- you know, the outside world on- on Brazil. And that- that's my two sense on that, but we're not the boss of that. Uh, you know, we're- we're price takers on that. Very fair. Thank you. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. The next question is from Alejandro Zemicona with Credits Lease. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi, Paolo. Hi, Richard, thank you for taking my questions. Um, I'm just, uh, curious on what's your view on the potential recovery, eh, of the international market c- to pre- COVID levels? And the, what would be the impact, uh, on geo inaudible, uh, international market, uh, reactivation? Hi, Alejandro. Actually, we are not that bullish. Uh, the international markets, uh, recover for 2022. There is two, uh, different, uh, regulations and different sanitary, uh, requirements, uh, which make us doubt whether it's gonna be possible to harmonize all of them, uh, in the first half of the year. So, this is one thing. The second is, also, that, uh- uh, the- the potential overcapacity with be deployed because you can imagine, the total amount of wide-bodies, uh, available in the world, those has not been. So, those have not been, uh, used widely for- for, I mean, many months. And- And also, clearly, if there's gonna be, when a specific segment been, uh, severely effected, uh, by the- the so-called, uh, new normal behavior, it's gonna be the long haul business trips. Uh, I think that this customer will really, uh, think twice beca- before deciding to take a plane for a short, uh- uh, business trip, mainly long haul. So, uh, honestly, I think that inaudible, the international markets will be, uh- uh- uh, effected, uh- uh, they are already effected and that effect will- will last longer than- than expect. So, uh, but on the other hand, I believe that the, uh, long haul leisure travelers will be there and- and- and mainly for the most important tourist destinations. So, but, you know, inaudible, uh, was the- the- the business traveler pre-pandemic for those airlines operating wide-bodies, business classes, businesses and- and- and first classes. Uh, I am not that- that bullish, uh- uh, about this- this specific market demand. Okay, thank you. And then, uh, a second question if I may, uh, on the maintenance. Uh, we- we saw a significant increase during this quarter in maintenance expense. So, we were wondering, uh, what was inaudible this increase and, uh, what can we expect going forward? Um, I- I assume that it's a- a- a catch-up from the deferred maintenance. Uh, but I- I'm just, uh, curious on hear your thoughts. Uh, thank you guys. Yeah, sure, Alejandro. I guess you didn't hear the answer to the previous question, but I'll- I'll go through that again. Um, the, you're asking about the increase in maintenance expenses from the Q2 to the Q3 from 88 million inaudible to 246 million inaudible. Um, that is from… And maybe- maybe, I'll- I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll answer it from a different, uh, perspective. That is related to the acceleration of the transition of the fleet from NTs to MAXes where we are accelerating the returns of aircraft. Now, over the next couple months, over the next year, and what you have to do on a quarterly basis is always be fully provisioned on your future redelivery estimates. And so, as we're accelerating now, the, um, the return of the IDs, you have, we have to top off, we have to increase the amount of provisions, uh, for maintenance on aircraft. And so, in that particular case, the- the- the- there was a certain number of aircraft, um, in the sin- you know, in the mid-single digits where, um, the, those provisions increased. That, so it's in there, always remember that. That's- That's, you- you always have to be estimating… If you're doing your accounting properly, you should always ask that question to make sure the companies are provisioning properly their future, uh, redelivery costs. You have to always be adjusting your, uh, provision for that. And for us, you know, the main component of those de- delivery costs is engine overhauls. And so, in our particular case, uh, as we increased the number of NTs that were returning and, you know, the number of MAXes that we're bringing in, uh, those provisions in the Q3 increase from 88 million inaudible to 246 million inaudible. Okay. Um, what I'm gonna do- Okay. Thank you. for… Yeah, sure, no- no worries. Um, we have, um, one more person in the queue, uh- uh, to ask a question. But before that I'm gonna take another question that we have from the, uh, platform, uh, which is asking about yields, RASK, and task, um, in Q2, Q3, Q4. And so, I'll just walk through that. Um, you know, we had a, you know, you know, 15 percent increase in yields in the Q3. And, you know, what's implicit in our Q4 guidance is, basically, flat yields versus the Q3. You know, we're being conservative on that given the, um, capacity, um, environment. Um, given that we are forecasting <unk> goes up a little bit, that will, in- in the Q4, uh- uh, is implied, um, a slight increase in RASK over where we were in the Q3. You know, we did the 26 cents in the Q3. We think we could be around something around 28 cents in the Q4. And on the cost side of the equation, um, you know, the recurring unit costs that we did in the, uh, in the Q3 of, uh, just under 22 cents in rial, uh, in those Q4 guidance numbers that we provided, um, is a similar level. Uh, even though we are, as I was mentioning, increasing the operating fleet and the Ludi six costs. As we return NTs and accelerate transition from the MAXes, uh, we have a combination of, you know, higher, um, expenses for maintenance for the re-deliveries, higher provisions, and also higher, um, higher depreciation. Um, and so that- that goes to, just looking down here, that basically addresses that, uh, question, uh, which is basically a conservative forecast for the Q4, uh, guidance we're providing. It's mainly volume driven. It's not being driven out of an increase in yields or a reduction in unit costs. As inaudible was mentioning, you know, if- if we get a higher ela- positive elasticity on the business side, that's gonna have a positive impact on yields, and, you know, um, could, uh, translate into, uh, better revenue numbers for the Q4. So with that, Operator, we can go back to the last question in the queue. Okay. I- I got a lot inaudible. Operator, you can go to the last question in the queue. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. This will be the last opportunity for questions for <unk>. The next question is from Matthew Breckenridge from DSC Meridian. Please go ahead. Hi, uh, my question has actually been answered. Thank you very much. Okay, Matt. Thanks. This concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to invite Mr. Kackenhoff to proceed with his closing remarks. Please go ahead sir. I just would like to thank you all very much for the attention. Uh, have a nice day. This concludes the Gol Airlines conference call for today. Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day.",
      "withCtc" : "Welcome to the Goal Airlines third quarter 2021 results conference call. This morning, the company made its numbers available along with three videos with the results presentation, financial review, and preliminary QA. Goal hopes everyone connected has watched them. After the company's brief remarks, we will initiate the QA session when further instructions will be provided. This event is also being broadcast live via webcast and may be accessed through the company website at www.voe.com.com dot br slash ir and on the MZIQ platform at www.mzik.com. Those following the presentation via the webcast may post their questions on the platform, and their questions will either be answered by the management during this call or by the goal investor relations team after the conference is finished. Before proceeding, let me mention that forward looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of goals management and on information currently available to the company. Risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors and analysts should understand that events related to macroeconomic conditions, industry and other, factors could also cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. At this time, I hand you over to Mr. Paul Kakinoff, CEO. Please begin. Good morning everyone and welcome to Go Red Lines Quarterly Earnings Call. I would like to start by highlighting our most important achievements of this period. The first one was the continued recovery in demand, which showed solid growth during the third quarter. At the end of September, Brazil became fourth among all countries with the most vaccines administered against COVID-19. Approximately fifty-six percent of Brazil's population is fully vaccinated, and over seventy-four percent have received their first dose, a higher percentage than the vast majority of the countries, including the United States. Similar to demand trends in other markets, the rising vaccination rate in the general population is supporting the air market's ongoing recovery. As a result, ghost departures in the fourth quarter grew by 87%, reaching 53% of the levels in 2019. In response to this demand, Goes expanding its network and has already announced a new route from Congonhas to Bonito, starting this December. We are taking a conservative approach to increasing capacity as travel demand recovers to help maintain high load factors and profitability in our roads. The second important event was the transition of the fleet to Boeing Maxis. In preparation for the strong recovery in air travel that we expect to see in the coming quarters, we signed agreements to accelerate the transformation of our fleet with the acquisition of twenty-eight additional Boeing seven three seven MAX8 aircraft. This initiative is expected to reduce the company's unit cost by eight percent in twenty twenty two. Under the new contracts, we went two thousand twenty-one with twenty-eight Max aircraft, which represents twenty percent of the fleet. By the end of two thousand twenty two, we expect to have forty four max aircraft raising this total to 32%. With current purchase commitments, we will meet our 2030 goal of having 75% of the fleet in this new aircraft. And as is widely recognized, the max is fifteen percent more fuel efficient, generates sixty percent less carbon emissions, and is forty percent quieter compared to the NG. This aircraft positions to grow even more competitively, expanding routes to new destinations and providing efficiency gains, all of which will capture more value for all our stakeholders. The third important achievement was the conclusion of the merger with Smiles into GLA. The transaction will generate greater value from several operational synergies as well as new opportunities and strategies that will become even more significant during the airline market recovery. We are optimistic that the synergies from this corporate reorganization expected to be approximately three billion in net present value for the next five years, and the subsequent benefits to our shareholders will be realized in a relatively short period of time. With that, I will hand the floor over to Richard, our CFO, Thank you, Kaki. Our most recent notable event was the success of our liability management program. In September, we issued $150 million in a retap at 8% annual interest rate on our senior secured notes, maturing in 2026. Moody's assigned the notes a rating of B2. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including aircraft acquisitions and working capital. In October, we refinanced our short-term bank debt in the amount of 1.2 billion reais via the extension of the seventh series of debentures and the issuance of our eighth series of simple non convertible debentures. This refinancing enabled the company to return to its lowest level of short-ter debmt since 2014 at about a half a billion reais, which will also improve goals credit metrics by better matching future assets and liabilities and reducing the company's average cost of debt. Our next relevant maturity date for outstanding debt is not until July 2024. Gold's balance sheet is now in a stronger position in terms of its outstanding debt versus our peers, which we view to be a competitive advantage in the current market environment. In addition, the company amortized around 518 million reais of debt in this quarter. The average maturity of goal's long-term debt, excluding aircraft leases and perpetual notes, is approximately 3.4 years with the main obligations already addressed in our cash flow. The net debt ratio, excluding exchangeable notes and perpetual bonds to adjusted last 12 months EBDA, was nine point seven times on september thirtieth, two thousand twenty one, representing the lowest financial leverage among peers. Considering the amounts fundable from deposits and unencumbered assets, the company's potential sources of liquidity resulted in approximately 6.1 billion reais of accessible liquidity. The recent capitalization of the balance sheet, with a capital increase led by the majority shareholder, represented the recognization of gold's value as Brazil's largest airline with the best product. The refinancing of our short term bank debt in October added to long term capital of two point seven billion reais raised in the second and third quarters of this year totals over three point nine billion reis of capital raised in the last seven months. As for our discussion of financial results for the quarter, it was shared this morning in the video presentation, and we believe you all had a chance to access that. In short, our work to reestablish operating margins that can support the sustained growth of our operations is bearing fruit. We ended the third quarter with an eBIT reaching three hundred and thirty eight million reies and an operating margin totaling seventeen point seven percent. Concurrently, the adjusted EBITDA reached four hundred and sixty four million reis with a twenty four point three percent margin, evidencing Thanks, Richard. We are seeing a recovering demand for air travel, and we believe that now, with greater population immunisation and the significant expansion of vaccination, we will have a strong fourth quarter coinciding with the start of the summer season. I would like to close by thanking our employees, the team of Eagles, who are working with extreme professionalism and commitment. All this intimidation puts us in a solid position to expand operations and achieve profitable growth. We reiterate our confidence that gold will emerge as strong and even more resilient as markets normalize. Now I would like to initiate the QA session. Thank you. The conference call is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press star one on your touch tone phone at this or any time. If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star too. We ask that when you ask your questions, speak close to the receiver of the device so that everyone can hear you clearly. Participants can also send questions via the webcast platform. You need to click on the question mark in the upper left corner and type in your question. Please hold while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Stephen Trent with City. Please go ahead. Good morning, gentlemen, and uh thanks very much for uh uh taking my questions, guys. Um I just kind of wanted, you know, your high level views on uh international demand to the US spooling up again. You know, uh now that you're partnering with American Airlines, you know, w what sort of bigger opportunity are you seeing on the horizon? And do you see any opportunity as well for American to possibly uh increase its stake and goal at some point in the future. Hi Steven Kirchnoff here. Good morning. Thank you very much for your question. Uh let me give you an overview on the North American market specifically. Uh firstly, you know, we are uh now gradually reintroducing our international routes. So we have uh uh already made available the ticket sales for uh Cancun, New Mexico, Dominican uh Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and we are now resuming flights to Montevideo and and Buenos Aires. So uh United States uh it will be likely the route to be added uh in our uh international portfolio by the second quarter next year and this is because uh you're right the the borders are now open to to the Brazilians but and there is a a a considerable but uh which is uh the the fault the exchange rate made the the purchase the the ticket purchase and the whole street cost, uh uh including hotels, credit card expense, pretty expensive from a Brazilian perspective. Uh you know, the real has uh devoluted quite significantly along the last quarter. So the Brazilian economic conditions uh is uh also uh w was a fa were factored during the the last three months and the combination of a clear excitement to resume international trips uh has a great contrast with the the important constraints imposed by the exchange rate. So the passengers are willing to fly mainly to the United States, uh but the that that trip became quite quite expensive at the moment. So uh I cannot say that there is a a boom uh related to North American ticket uh to uh related to airline tickets uh to fly to to the United States. You know, we are about to begin the Brazilian high season, December and January. And uh typically that that's the period when you see more passengers uh willing to to to travel for a leisure purpose. This is not gonna be different this year, maybe uh uh slightly uh better for the international markets. And the second constraint which is also affecting the demand is that there is a a backlog to provide uh North American visas to the Brazilians which will not be uh uh sold or uh neither addressed in the short term. So if you have a a five members uh a family of five members, uh it's pretty much likely that least one of them has no valid visa uh at the moment. Make n making not it possible to to fly to the United States. So all those things combined uh are uh affecting the the potential uh uh uh flight uh uh catch up that we could get if not by this these two uh constraints. And finally in our case we have the partnership with American Alliance who has uh already deployed a a considerable uh ST increase uh for the following three months. So we have decided uh to to support uh that investment by selling n the American Alliance tickets in our channels as as we have done already since April two thousand twenty. Uh and through that strategy we are simultaneously uh tending our customers and uh uh uh supporting this additional capacity increase deployed by American Alliance, our partners. So we believe that this is the the the the best uh strategy to to cope with the current demand and then we will uh resume our own flight from Brasilia to Florida uh a market w which has not been attended by American Alliance at the moment from the second or next year on. So this is I mean an overview on the North American market on the Brazilian perspective in the airline segment. And and and just very quickly uh one last thing uh on business travel, any sort of high level trends you're seeing in the domestic market and and let me leave it at that. Thank you. We we uh might be surprised by uh the speed uh uh through which the the business segment is uh recovering the uh uh the uh its pre pandemic uh level. We are now uh verifying that identifying actually that some specific segments in Brazil is catching up uh its business travel behavior uh even above the the pre pandemic level. Those are the services in uh generally speaking, uh mainly those those companies pretty much uh uh uh benefited by by the the new customer behavior. So like food delivery, just to say uh uh one example and and e commerce. So those segments are are booming and they are probably more than they were uh before the pre pandemic and also uh some i if I could say so some other traditional segments, uh those are pretty strong in in Brazil, uh such as the agricultural business, oil and gas and some specific industries. So we we foresee that by the beginning of the next year we might be above our prior projection, which has considered that one third of the business travellers would be gun for good, which might be not the case. So i it it's it's too early to be precise uh on that projection but uh at this this moment we see that some uh segments are recovering faster than than expected. Great thank you very much, Kaki. Thank you. The next question is from Mike Lindenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Oh yeah. Hey, good morning everybody. Um I want to just um kind of run through liquidity and I don want't to make sure I'm sort of comparing apples to apples here. So SEPQ, your total liquidity, it looked like it ended at two point one billion REIs and you're guiding to three eight at year end. Is that um Rich, is that predominantly the American airlines investment and an improvement or an increase in your ATL? Or is there other things we should be mindful of? Yeah no the you know any any transaction that's not closed is not in those numbers. So that that is not in those numbers, Michael, nor is new additional uh capital raising. Um the the Q three number, uh and I'll I'll walk you through that. Q three number, which was composed of the four billion reais that you mentioned, which is about uh one point one billion of cash and investments, about three hundred million reais of restricted cash, about six hundred million reais of accounts receivable, and one point nine billion reais of deposits. Uh the way that would break down in the Q four would be about nine uh uh nine hundred to a billion reize of cash and investments about this uh which is down around uh two hundred million reyes because as we ramp up uh to the high season and get our fleet back up above a hundred operating aircraft, we're investing in working capital, spare parts, if you will, to um uh get all these aircraft up and flying. So that that's effectively going into uh assets uh but it's obviously consuming some liquidity and to some extent it's also increasing our spare parts inventory which uh supports the collateral in our senior secured notes program. Uh the restricted cash uh will be a similar balance of around three hundred million reis. Yep. Uh accounts receivable accounts receivable increases about two hundred million reais to eight hundred million reais. That's obviously associated with the um ramp up in operations. So we expect by the Q one we should be back uh to a more normalized level of accounts receivable, which should be, you know, somewhere between one to one point two billion reis. The deposit amount goes down uh from the Q three to the Q four by about a hundred million reis because as we uh as we return aircraft, um you know we, use some of those uh security deposits as well as uh the answer reserve deposits to cost out uh the returns of the NGs because as you know we're accelerating our transition from the MGs to the masses. And so we're using um those deposits to cost out air property deliveries, which is why, as we said, you know, we do have access access to those deposits as it relates to the to the asset that they're supporting and um and so that's why we include that number in our liquidity. So that that basically there's no external capital raising in there, it's all operational. So the the difference which is around you know that, total number down from four billion to uh three point eight billion, it basically represents an investment in working capital uh spare parts to uh end the year with uh a little over a hundred operating aircraft. Okay. So that okay, that's helpful. So it's it's flattish to slightly down before anything and we know that we're you know, hopefully, capital raising in there if you know we have in addition to that and kind of maybe taking advantage of your question because we have some questions on how we get to the six point one billion of liquidity. Uh in addition to what I described, you know, we have uh potential financing sources of uh based on existing uh unencumbered assets that we have of a little over two billion Ray. And so how we get to the six billion, the additional two billion uh comes out of unencumbered assets. About half of that is the collateral we have uh through the loyalty program. You know, in the Q three we finalized the take in of the loyalty program, so now we control one hundred percent of those assets and the additional collateral uh we have uh in air parks and intellectual property, uh which if we wanted to could be deposited into our senior security oaths program uh to raise additional capital. We have no plans currently uh to do anything with this additional collateral, but it is important to highlight that the unencumbered assets that we have represents a potenti a potential additional two billion R eyes of long term capital should we uh uh choose to pursue that. Okay. Now that's super helpful. And then just um you know you you're always helpful in sort of calling out, you know, the call it the non op operating expenses associated with fleet idleness and personnel related costs and in this quarter, this fourth quarter, it looks like it's just gonna be under a billion Riyes. Now, over the year that number has actually moved up meaningfully despite the fact that you are putting more people and planes back into service. So I don't know, is that is that an FX related issue what's driving that number, or am I just my logic and thinking that as you put more people and planes back to work and that that should go down, that logic's that maybe there's something wrong there and how it's being accounted for. If you could just detail that. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, I think what's uh I think it's a the a depreciation effect, uh Michael, which is a non-cash effect in there. And so uh part of it uh relates to that. Um also, you know, in the Q three uh you know the number in the Q three the number of flights is still reduced. Um and so the substantial ramp up in the um in the Q four. Okay. And uh that will kind of revert back. But in the in the Q three, also in the month of uh September, as you know, we scaled had to scale back a little bit uh given the transition of our PSS uh which impacted our you know, our scale and our our revenues and and our ability to uh improve uh fixed cost solution, you know, because of the migration to the uh to the revenue system which was done in August and um and September. But in the Q three, you know, we had uh uh seventy uh aircraft operated and so we still had sixty aircraft still idle in the Q three. And so what you're seeing there is in in the Q three is the effect of those sixty aircraft um still idle. That number at the end of the Q four will be reduced to you know hopefully less than thirty. Um and and so those those uh you know we we're we're trying to you know separate that out. I think we're one of the few companies that tries to separate that out for you guys in though it's separating the idle cost versus the uh total. Uh but we'll probably only see a normalization on a on a unit cost basis for comparative purposes in the Q one. Because we're still gonna have, you know, idle c idle idle cost in the Q four. Well so now when you say normal in Q one are you are you saying that approaches zero in Q one or I I'm just assuming it gets to zero by the back part of twenty twenty two, but maybe maybe it gets there sooner. Oh no no no no in the in the Q one because again we're you know we've returned aircraft. Uh we are uh th this Q four is uh activation of a majority of the grounded aircraft and as we get into the January, February high season, you know, there might be a little bit in there in the Q four, but for the most part will be eliminated. And then when you get into the the normal seasonality, you know the Q two for us is kind of a down uh seasonality normally. We'll have to see where how the as Kaki said, we could have some positive surprises on the corporate demand uh uh making the Q two of next year a little bit uh better than we might normally see. But uh for us the Q one, because again, you know, we're a hundred percent domestic focused. Uh we don't have wide bodies, we don't depend on the international piece. And you know, the right sizing we did on our capacity and our fleet, if you will, uh should kind of you know triangulate to you know goal being back to more or less normalized uh operating efficiency by end of December, beginning of January. Okay, great. Thanks for that, Rich. Thanks everyone. Oh hey, good morning guys. Um couple questions here. I guess um first another question on the corporate recovery. Big picture, you know, what are you hearing from corporate customers today on their travel plans for next year? And then just related to that, you know, given the FX volatility, I believe there's a certain percent of the revenue that actually benefits from a weaker Brazilian hail. So I'm you know, I'm thinking the oil and gas sectors, I'm thinking agriculture. So it seems like there should be a component of the revenue there that should do a little better um, you know, if the Brazilian hail weekend. But you know, maybe you could clarify or or even correct me on that. the same day we resume flight on January one and i it is somehow attached to their uh home office uh policy which is for the best major valid into the the end of this year. Uh i i when we talk specifically to those statements you have just repeated, uh they are already uh pulling some uh troubles ahead, but this is not even close to the the potential they have told us to the next year on. Uh in a in a side note, the way w we have restructured ourselves to address that specific market via a new passenger service system, the SABR, we will likely give us an additional um uh set of of sales because we can now in in a much more flexible and and fast way uh address some uh uh specific demands raised by the the corporate cycle. So I believe that we we will have the combination of a better product with a redesign network which might uh accelerate the uh the the the the the the the speed uh uh we are now envisioning to to have that to see that segment uh the that specific segment catching up. trying to get at is it it seems like there should be some pent up demand uh next year. And so I guess it just um uh was thinking that there's potentially some more revenue upside here that that folks might be underappreciating. Um but you know going, back to I guess you know a question for Edu or or um is just with respect to that cut over a saber that you just referenced, you know, the ability to market products in a way digitally that you haven't been able to historically. You know, so as you think about the grand vision, you know, what is the f time frame for exploiting that full capability and you know, how material could that be? I think that's gonna be very we're gonna have a hundred percent of the these improvements and enhancements deploy uh until the end of this year and then we will gradually because those are marketing events uh we'll be gradually offering them to the customers along uh two twenty two uh twenty two. Uh it's really really difficult to to g to give you a flavor on how uh material those improvements can be. But we are now basically closing uh every single gap that we could get from a customer service point of view, uh to a a full legacy company at the same time digitally speaking, I mean I I'm talking about digital services. Uh at the same time that we are uh now uh uh resuming the ki the cask advantage that we always had. So I believe that the combination of the two things will uh uh is more than promising, is something that can definitely uh positively affect uh our our results. But I wouldn't like to uh because I couldn't at the moment to to share any any percentage or or or precise numbers on on that expectation. Okay, thanks for the time you guys. Thanks. Let me just uh before we go to the next question on the cell side analyst, uh let me weave in uh a question we have from uh one of our bice investors sending us questions on the platform. And I'll basically do that uh so that we don't have to save the uh people that sent the questions through the platform don't have to wait until the end of this but, we'll come back um to the next uh question from the self side analyst as I go through uh this question from one of our sixtigum investors. Um it has three components on the results. Um please explain what was the write-off of deposits for aircraft leases and uh aircraft uh lease deposits and maintenance reserve deposits. Uh so just to explain that to you to answer your question. In in the cash flow in the quarter and the third quarter, we recognized uh provisions for return of aircraft of 106 176 million reis. Um and against that we uh were able to use and reverted uh one hundred and sixty six million reais of maintenance reserves and then we um reduced um we have a um a um reduction in deposits of two hundred sixty four million reyes. And all this relates to what I was speaking about previously, but it ref refers to uh us maintaining current our maintenance provisions uh for uh the transformation of the fleet from Max's uh Tange. So really it the the provision for the return of aircraft that's in that, and you can see that in the uh in the tables in the back of the release and also in the footnotes of the financial statement is about 176 million rise, which has to be provisioned because you know from an accounting perspective, because we are uh accelerating the return of NGs to maxes. And um we are no longer uh uh constituting any more maintenance reserves uh because we're utilizing deposits, maintenance reserve deposits uh to cross that out, as I mentioned in the previous question. So there's more or less a a hundred percent offset between uh use of maintenance reserves and and what I just mentioned. Within that question as well, there was is what what was the provision for legal proceedings in your cash flow? Uh in the cash flow we have a payment for uh legal proceedings uh in there of about a hundred and fifty million reais related to uh contingencies on PIS and COFINS taxes. Um and then there is in that amount as well, in that legal proceedings line item that you're looking at there uh from the person who asked the question. There are uh other credits that increase 192 million reales that compensate more or less compensate these values uh of these legal proceedings in the same amount. And then the final component of the question in that category, what was the uh what was the reason for the increase in other expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2021, which is basically uh two hundred ninety six million reais versus one hundred sixty seven million reais. And that is a a necessity we had to constitute an increased provision uh for contingencies uh on peace and coin taxes for the importation of aircraft, uh because one of our peers, uh Azul, uh lost uh a process in the amount of lost a lawsuit in the amount of uh 150 million reis and so that forced us to change our perspective from uh a possible loss on that uh discussion uh if those taxes apply to the importation of aircraft to probable. And you know in the uh uh uh in the accounting policies process when it goes to uh probable you then have to constitute uh a provision. But that was based on we have not yet lost the uh discussion with the government, but as one of the our peers did lose the discussion uh that then uh creates the need to increase the amount of uh provision on that. So hopefully that answers your questions on some of those uh details as you're looking at uh those items that are less focused on So. operator we can go back to the um to the um to the call list on the uh south side analyst. And the next question will be from Savvy Fifth with Raymond James. Please go ahead Hey good morning. This is uh Matt on Persavi here. Um either Rich or Kaki. Um if you could regarding the the twenty twenty two uh Cascx outlook, the eight percent reduction versus twenty nineteen. Um, could you give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of capacity production and utilization there? Um also is there is there any change in in the um NG re deliveries or or anything we should consider there? Sorry, if you could r you you're asking about we didn't could you repeat the question? Because I think you were asking about twenty two. Twenty twenty two, right? The case that's okay. So I think it was more so maybe on the you talked about the eight percent reduction in in cask from the fleet. Um I wasn't sure if the the slide, I believe it was twenty three, if that was an early outlook into twenty twenty two or Yeah the the the the max has a lower operating cost than the NGs and so as our aircraft portfolio increases the amount of aircraft that are max um that has a uh effect of reducing our unit costs. The main source of that is the the lower fuel uh consumption. You know we're getting the as advertised, you know, roughly for us it's about sixteen percent less uh fuel consumption. And so I think that's what you're you're asking about then. Okay, certainly that makes that makes sense. I'm sorry, I thought I thought it was uh maybe early looking to to twenty twenty two um on the Cascac side. Is there anything that we should consider though in terms of how you you plan to return to uh your fleet utilization or capacity early looking to twenty twenty two that we should consider? Beyond the field systems there. Yeah, if I understood the question, I mean we'll be back, you know, in our ecosystem, we'll be back to more normalized aircraft utilization numbers in the Q one. Uh you know, which for us is, you know, you know, you know, it should be the sweet spot for us is kind of twelve hours a day of utilization. You know, we expect to be uh back above eleven hours of utilization in the T one. Okay. Thanks, Rich. Um and then if I could on the on the revenue side, versus what you were thinking in Jul in late July last quarter when you provided guidance to now what's in the four key revenue outlook. What has changed? I know you talk looking out into one Q has some corporate segments have come back faster, but that for Q never has gone lower versus late July. So I was wondering what has changed since then. Yeah, sure. I think you know we you know we revised down the revenue forecast for the Q four. Uh it's mainly based on uh lower yi overall yields in the market and um which has a big effect uh just given the uh still situation of uh low uh efficiency and then also and and that's overall market, that's not just us. And then the um and we've been staying out of the way of that um scenario and how we how do we stay out of the way of that? We know we keep capacity uh lower. And so when you combine those effects, you know, us staying out of the way of the low yield environment, given the over capacity uh coming out of competitors uh and adjusting our offer down our our capacity down, you know, those two effects magnify into the reduced uh revenue. Uh but the catalyst is obviously more on the yield side. You know, we have the ability to flex up capacity uh faster if we need to, uh given the amount of aircraft that we have. But you know, we have had a management uh during this twenty months of the pandemic uh focused on two key metrics. One is uh preserving our unit cost advantage uh in the post pandemic environment and also matching our cash inflows with cash outflows and so that limits uh what we can do. Uh and you've seen how we've done that, uh for those of you that are following us, you've seen how we've done that through the pandemic um in terms of uh minimizing any operating uh cash burn. So and how how we do that through the capacity uh equation. If yields are better, we can we can track that up. Now as Kakin mentioned, we're now in the process of reactivating our core uh network, uh which is mainly focused on the business traveler and as as you saw in the slides as well, that shifts our focus from a network perspective from that massive hub we created in Guadalupe managed through the pandemic based on connecting flights, which is not that convenient uh for gold passengers, to going back to uh a more point to point network uh with uh very attractive uh point to point flights out of our other hubs and also from our shuttle markets uh out of uh São Paulo Rio and Brazilia. That's happening as we speak. And so at the goal uh in the goal uh ecosystem that uh can have a significant impact on yields as if if we have some positive surprises on the corpus coming back. I think we'll see that more in the Q one uh because we're still in a transition on that and we're still not back to normalized levels uh on market capacity uh as well as uh demand uh from the the business traveling. Now those effects that you mentioned on the revenue side, obviously they they have the effect on uh EBITDA uh because it means lower scale and so less less fixed cost solution. And so that's why our expectations for Q4 EBITDA are down a bit. The other thing that is in there is um as I was mentioning I think in the in one of the previous questions is an increase in uh CapEx, uh about a two hundred million Rail increase in in CapEx in the Q four. That that mainly relates to investments in uh spare parts inventories and other assets related to reactivation of the operating system. So when you kind of those are the factors, you know, one obviously on the yield uh capacity side and then the other on the CapEx side that account uh for about a uh four hundred million rial reduction in our target of liquidity uh for the end of the Q four, but about half of that number is investment in assets. Like I said, it also has has a side benefit of increasing the uh collateral pool uh that's in our uh secured uh notes program. And those same effects will get you to the uh difference in the leverage. Uh those exact same effects all kind of roll into that. Um and um and and and um and so it's uh it's um it's a it's a transitional uh quarter for us. Um and um uh th there there are there are some s uh exchange rate effects in there, obviously. Uh they kind of run through those calculations and put pressure on it, you know, on the on the on the net net side of the equation also. Um and those result in massive negative exchange rate effects, but those are not economic and don't affect cash flow, just to highlight that 'cause we have gotten some questions on what what are exchange uh and monetary variations, you know, for those that aren't maybe familiar with uh investing in um developing countries with uh weak uh functional currencies. Now our functional currency is real uh therefore um we have to recognize the exchange rate variation on the balance sheet and that produces accounting effects in negative and positive uh you know the exchange uh and monetary uh variations, which continue to be quite large given the uh short term uh negative uh devaluation of the Brazilian real. And so but that for the most part we recommend kind of backing that out, which what we which is what we try to do in our in our um uh uh uh uh uh furnished uh disclosures. Certainly. Well thank thank you very much for all the color there, but really appreciate it and the time. Okay. The next question is from Dwayne Fenigworth with Ebercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Good to speak with you. Um on Fleet, can you just maybe play back uh for us the the Fleet simplification opportunity here? I mean it's not just Macs and and you've outlined those. Uh you did a number of fleet transactions pre COVID, uh you know, short term leases to solve for a gap. Uh then COVID hit. Can can you just help bring us up to speed on on where we are with respect to those shorter term leases rolling off and and what the fleet simplification opportunity is here. Yes. Um yeah we still have a a fair amount of uh NGs on short-term operating leases um where we have you know the optionality of either extending those or returning them the uh the nut there to crack is the availability maxes. Market right now is constrained in terms of the availability maxes, just given that Boeing is still uh only producing uh you know below twenty maxes a day, so still quite low, which is about a third of what they were producing pre uh pandemic. We have all the financing sources lined up to uh add as many maxes as we want to uh in the short term and next year. Uh you know the bottleneck is the availability of uh new maxes. Uh there are still some white bells out there, but they have, you know, significant configuration costs and other issues that um make them less attractive. Now so we have the ability to accelerate the returns of energy based on the structure of our aircraft portfolio, which is which is still to the today a 100% operating lease. And I think another part of the simpliationfic that you're mentioning or that you're hinting at is that what we will do also as we move into the acceleration of the transition from energy to the max, you know, in addition to this, you know, the operating cost benefit based on the lower fuel consumption and and higher higher seat count on those aircraft and so on is the component of uh how we're financing those acquisitions and so we will also be doing more uh finance release uh transactions as you move forward. Uh you know, somewhere in the order of between four and maybe as much as sixteen of those next year um depending on the availability maxes and there's a significant equity value creation that that comes with that. As you saw on the previous cycle when we did forty uh finance leases on the first Rip Boeing, then we created an excess of five hundred million dollars of cash equity uh gains uh through that process and it also gives us equity to borrow gains and things like that. And so the I guess the other component I would say, Dwayne, of that is our ability to sit back in the uh in the game of um uh owning uh a a portion of our fleet. Uh you know and the reason why we're a hundred percent operating at least today is you, know, pre pandemic we had uh uh finalized the monetization of our N G portfolio and we were in the midst of you know, still in the midst of the Mac the max uh grounding. And so we in in that when then the pandemic happened, all that's kind of got pushed out. So we have enormous flexibility to return uh NGs at a faster pace. Um and the bottleneck is the availability maximum to do it. Operationally, you know, we're scaled up, you know, our our operational capacity, you know, on a normalized basis is easily, you know, two aircraft receipts and two re deliveries per month. You know, two in, two out, four total, we can go as high as three per month, um, given our operational uh capability. And so for us it's operational easy easily uh uh done operationally to you know bring in twenty four maxes and and and transition out twenty four NGs next year if we need to do. So uh our our our fleet plan is a little bit less than that and part of it's because we're still in the sourcing of the right maxes uh for that activity. But I think it's important to mention that none of that is going to consume uh our liquidity because we already have the financing uh sources lined up to uh pay for those uh max acquisitions that are in our plan plus some additionals if we need it. We already have the if you will the liability is lined up and we're still working on uh additional sourcing of aircraft. Hopefully that that answers your question. Yeah, listen, it it does. The um the delivery rate you know came up on the Ryanair call as well. Um so I I guess the question would be for the for the deliveries that you've outlined, you know, for the rest of this year and into twenty two, how how many of those are are already built? Um and you know, how does that forecast feel Well in terms of what's coming out of the factory, um we would need you know somewhere between eight to ten aircraft. If it if the source is the factory, if the source is the whitetail market, we've got that covered. And that's that's what we're working on as we speak. Uh the issue with the white tail market is we have some additional reconfiguration costs that we wouldn't have if it was coming out of the factory uh for us. But um but um maybe you can help us convince Boeing to ramp up production to sell more aircraft. Um Um I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't be your guy I wouldn't be your guy for that, but um just I'll sneak one more in here, Rich, um because I'm always interested in your thoughts here. You know, what what FX rate kind of drives the the long term plan and you know for what it's worth you know how how do we get there how do you see the path um to to to that long term rate thank you well um we're not in charge of that, but um the you know, most uh bank market forecasts are for an appreciating real, you know, something with a four handle on it uh at some point next year if you take fair value calculations, our fair value calculations are below four. Um you know we're now twelve months inside of um presidential elections in Brazil. Um and so that uh that is uh gonna be a factor that will maintain volatility high. Um you know we addressed in our presentation on the videos on the website this morning and also in our release, I mean the the Brazil fiscal situation is much better and improving. I mean it's much better than the US uh fiscal situation, for example. And you know, GDP in Q three was up uh four percent. Uh it's around three percent for the for the Q four, uh which is down a little bit. Um but I I I think, you know, my own personal opinion would be you're gonna see weakness in the currency uh because of the political dynamic uh between now and October of next year. Um but um you know going back to Kaky's point, that is gonna keep a relatively captive audience for us for domestic air travel, uh, which is perhaps a silver lining on that, uh which is why we're not um focused today on driving international travel, uh just given the lower purchasing uh power of uh Brazilians and in Reize. And I have to point you to market projections on that because there is it does seem to be a disconnect between the fundamentals of Brazil and the currency which are related to other factors. High oil prices are a are a are a gold uh factor uh for Brazil. Uh you know the raw materials uh sector in Brazil, the extraction economy, which primarily drives the Brazilian economy, has been doing very well during this pandemic. Um and that will create a positive effect in you know and in what other people were asking about in terms of the uh elasticity of the return of corporate travel um in terms of those sectors being uh consumers of air travel. So on the volume side I think the exchange rate is less of an issue. Um it obviously does affect uh cash flow because it pressures both the oil price that we have to pay, which is nine million dollars, as well as the uh uh the aircraft uh costs uh which is not ideal. Uh but it doesn't look like we're gonna be getting any let's say market relief on that anytime soon. Um and uh just given the volatility and you know the the relative perception of the ex you know the outside world on on Brazil. I mean that's that's my two cents on that but we're not the boss of act. Uh you know we're we're price takers on that. Very fair. Thank you. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. The next question is from Alejandro Zamacona with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi Paulo. Hi Richard. Thank you for taking my questions. Um I'm just uh curious on what's your view on the potential recovery uh of the international market uh to pre COVID levels and uh what would be the impact uh on yields amid this uh international market uh reactivation. Hi Alejandro, actually we are not that bullish uh this national market uh recovery for twenty twenty two. There are still uh different uh regulations and different sanitary uh requirements uh which make us uh doubt whether it's gonna be possible to harmonise all of them uh in the first half of the year. So this is one thing. The second is also that uh a a a potential overcapacity will be deployed because you can imagine the total amount of uh white bodies uh available in the world, those have not been those those have not been uh utilised for for I mean many months and and also clearly if there is gonna be when a specific segment being severely affected uh by the the so called uh new normal behaviour, it's gonna be the long haul business trips. Uh I think that this customer will really uh think twice bec before deciding to take a plane for a short uh uh business trip, mainly long haul. So uh honestly I think that generally speaking the international markets will be uh uh uh affected. Uh they are already affected and that effect will will last longer than than expected. So uh by another hand I believe that uh uh long haul leisure travelers will be there and and and mainly for the most important tourist destinations. So but you know how important uh was the the the business trouble pre pandemic for those airlines operating white bodies, business classes, businesses and and and and first class uh I am not that that bullish uh uh about this this specific market demand. Okay, thank you. And then yeah a second question if I may uh on the maintenance. Uh we we saw a significant increase in during this quarter in the maintenance expense. So we were wondering uh what was behind this increase and uh what can we Thank you guys. Yeah, sure. Um the you're asking about the increase in maintenance expenses from the Q two to the Q three from eighty eight million reis to two hundred and forty six million reis. Um that is from and maybe I'll I'll give it I'll give it I'll answer from a different uh perspective. That is related to the acceleration of the transition of the fleet from NGs to MAXs, where we are accelerating the returns of aircraft now over, the next couple months, over the next year. And what you have to do on a quarterly basis is always be fully provisioned on your future re-delivery estimates. And so as we're accelerating now the um the return of the M D's you have we have to top up, we have to increase the amount of provisions uh for maintenance on aircraft. And so in that particular case, th th there there's a certain number of aircraft um in the sea you know, in the mid single digits where um th those provisions increase. That so it's in there, always remember that that that's's you you always have to be estimating if you're doing your accounting properly, and to always ask that question to make sure the companies are provisioning properly their future uh re-delivery costs, you have to always be adjusting your uh provision for that. And for us, you know, the main component of those delivery costs is engine overhauls. And so in our particular case, uh as we increased the number of NGs that were returning and you know the number of maxes that we're bringing in, uh those provisions in the Q3 increase from eighty eight million realis to two hundred and forty six million reis. Okay. Um what I'm gonna do before no sure no no worries. Um we have um one more person in the queue uh uh to ask a question, but before that I'm gonna take another question that we have from the uh platform uh which is asking about yields, RASC and CASC, um two, Q3, Q4, and so I'll just walk through that. Um you know, we had a you know you know fifteen percent increase in yields in the Q three and you know what's implicit in our Q Q fo4ur guidance is basically flat yields versus the Q3. You know, we're being conservative on that given the capacity environment. Um given that we are forecasting load factors up a little bit, that will in in the Q four uh uh is implied um a slight increase in RASC over where we were in the Q three. You know, we did the twenty-six cents in the Q three. We think we could be around something around twenty-eight cents in the Q four. The cost side of the equation, um, you know, the recurring unit costs that we did in the uh in the Q three of uh just under twenty two cents in real, uh in those two four guidance numbers that we provided, um, is a similar level. Uh even though we are, as I was mentioning, increasing the operating fleet and diluting fixed costs, as we return NGs and accelerate transition from the maxes, uh we have a combination of you know higher um expenses for maintenance for the redeliveries higher provisions and also higher uh higher depreciation um And so that that goes to just looking again, yeah, that basically addresses that uh question, uh, which is basically a conservative forecast for the Q4 uh guidance pro wevid'ingre, it's mainly volume driven. It's not being driven out of an increase in yields or a reduction in unit costs. But Saki was mentioning, you know, if if we get a higher el positive elasticity on the business side, that's gonna have a positive impact on yields and you know um could uh translate into uh better revenue numbers for the Q4. With that operator we can go back to the last question in the queue. Okay, I might get one after that. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. This will be the last opportunity for questions for Gaul's management. Hi. My question has actually been answered. Thank you very much. Okay, Matt. Thanks. This concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to invite Mr. Kakanoff to proceed with his closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. I just would like to thank you all very much for the attention. This concludes the GOAL Air Alliance call for today. Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day."

      "baseline" : "Okay. Good morning to all. Welcome to Sabespis Video Conference to discuss the earnings for Q three. My name is Maju Sampaio. I am head of capital markets and investor relations at Subesp. Today we have with us here the Dr. Benedict. Doctor Benedito Braga, Chairman of Subesti, Mr. Osvaldo Garcia, Director, Financial Economic Director and Investor Relations, Mr. Marcelo Miyagi, Head of Accounting, Marcelo Sanches, Superintendent of Regul for Regulation. Before passing the floor to Dr. Braga to begin the conference, I'd like to give some information. First, this video conference is being recorded and the presentation will be available for download at our portal press release where we already have the press release. will t will be for an hour and thirty minutes and we will have forty five minutes to answer questions from analysts and at the end we will have time for questions from journalists. To conclude a small disclosure. We would like to clarify that any declarations made during this conference concerning the business perspectives of the company, projections, operational and financial goals are based on beliefs and assumptions of the company's board and also information currently available to the company. Considerations about the future are not guarantee of performance. They involve risks and uncertainties because they refer to future events and Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operational factors may affect the future results of the company and may lead to results that may differ materially from those expressed in these considerations about the future. Now I would like to pass the floor to Dr. Braga. Doctor Braga, you have the floor for the opening of this conference. Thank you very much, Mario. Good morning to everyone. It's a great satisfaction to bring to you on this rainy morning good news to all. We had very positive financial results, but I will allow our CFO, Dr. Osvaldo Garcia, to talk about the this point to you. I would like to begin with with three or four topics that are of your interest also as a result of this good news we have a rainy morning concerning the water safety. We had uh stamps we are actually having a situation. That is an extreme drought in the south southeast of Brazil, and this even affected the electricity sector. And also as Dr. Oswaldo may explain, issues involving cost of energy that went up as a result of this extreme drought situation that we are having. And we were able to get a special authorization from the water authorities to bring from our reservoir in Jaguari on Paraíba do Sul River forty million cubic meters. These are additional until the end of this year, and a additional forty million cubic meters until the end of this year, thus increasing our water safety. I also inform in this direction, talking about water safety, that the the uh works for abstraction of water from Kapanyau River to the reservoir in the Alto Tieti system may remove or may abstract two point five two point five million uh cubic meters of water with a monthly average uh uh like this the works are going very well and in the first Now concerning rainfall we had a month of October that was a little above average in terms of rainfall, but a month of November in the first two weeks But we still have hopes that in the second in the in the second part of November we may have more rainfall to recover our levels at the reservoirs without the need to have any extraordinary measures to guarantee the supply of water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. In the interior we had a situation in the city of Frenca in the month of August September we had to begin a rationing plan, but this situation is over and today the supply of water in the city of Franca is normal. So in the other cities three hundred and seventy five cities w the situation is okay concerning the supply of water. Another important piece of news, very important news, is the implementation of Nets at NETA. This platform will allow the new tariff structure that we have this structure where we will have a single tariff for all municipios, our cities application and And this will be applied in twenty twenty two uh and reminding you that the minimum character disappears and we will have a fixed tariff for water connection and plus water consumption. So the person will only pay for what they use, but there will be a fixed fee in the new structure, in the new tariff structure. Also through this new platform NATA NETA we will have uh different interaction with clients, much better interaction with payment via PIC, credit cards. In other words, a modernization, a very important modernization and update. Right now we are implementing this system. There are some initial issues. For example, we have at our contact center. Also we had a problem with fake news on on on fake bills from subestes. But the NATO system has a much greater efficiency, brings us this greater efficiency and a reduction in delinquency due to the fact that we are working with taxpayer numbers taxpayer numbers and ID numbers. Our corporate area did an excellent job, an important job, and we inaugurated this new era in terms of relationship with the clients, uh the monitorament and the monitoring of our meters. So this is an important piece of news. We are modernizing the company. Now, concerning the new sanitation law and the decree that regulates Article sixteen B uh in terms of the U.S. improving the economic financial capacity of the company as a result of the goal for twenty thirty three concerning ninety nine percent coverage with water and also sanitation. We are very comfortable uh with imposition these The issues yes. We will have conditions to prove our financial economic capacity as a result of the following. Our largest consumers, our largest cities will not need investments in CapEx. We had already foreseen getting to a situation of universalization before twenty thirty three. Also, I can mention here that unfortunately the federal government did not act on time in regulating this law and published. This decree with nine months nine months late, the National Water Agency regulated other indices. That we will have to follow everything here late, but we are working hard and fast for everything to be done everything that is from our part until december thirty first and with this we will be absolutely in agreement with the new law for sanitation. Finally, I would like to mention that Subespy was the only company in the southern hemisphere to have an agreement with UNFCC, which is the platform of the United Nations for climate change where we are collaborating in this worldwide movement to increase the resilience of the water systems. We participated actively in COP twenty six and showing that these discussions of the UN, the twenty sixth have focused a lot on the energy issue CO two the problems that will happen in long in the long term, in the future, but they uh were not concerned with adaptation, which is happening right now. You can see the issues concerning the drought we have in Brazil, and FSV has been an example for the rest of the world, for the sanitation companies in the world, because it prepared itself. We adapted ourselves to climate change. So it is with great satisfaction that we saw that the final report of the chairman of COP twenty six gave more importance to the adaptation issue. And not only this, the next COP that will happen in Egypt next year, the focus will be on everyone adapting themselves and how this will impact and im and bring an improvement to the less developed countries in the southern hemisphere. Also, within this context of ESG, the company is alert, the company is getting stronger and stronger in this direction, ESG. Well, I believe you are more interested right now in hearing our CFO and the positive results in finance. So Dr. Osvaldo you have the floor. Good morning Chairman Braga. Good morning to all. I thank you all for participating in this uh video conference to discuss your Beginning on slide three, we observe the total volume build with a growth of three point seven percent in relation to Q three twenty. This considering the volumes of Mawa, which in this quarter is working in retail and Q three in Q three twenty twenty. Uh they were working in uh not in retail. Well this considering the volumes that are exempt from collection and also social and residential categories in Shanty T. This growth is greater in the uh sewer services four point one percent in relation to the volume build in the segment of water that rose three point four percent. The most significant increase happened in the non residential categories with where tariffs are higher fifteen point seven percent in public, seven percent in commercial and six point six percent in industrial clients. In the residential segment, which represents the greatest volume in relation to the total, the growth was three point two percent. With a recovery of consumption in non residential categories, we noticed a recovery in the average tariff with favorable impact on revenue. Next slide, please. Now we'd like to see the slide with financial numbers. The revenue from sanitation services had an increase of seventeen point seven percent in the period, going from three point six billion in Q three twenty to four point three billion RAIS in Q three twenty one, especially as a result of tariff increases applied on clients' bills. In August twenty twenty, three point four percent, and since May this year, an increase of seven percent. The effects are can be seen in the revenue in this quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. Also, we add the increase of three point seven percent in the total volume built, which explains the relevant increase of the total revenue of sanitation services and the operation of water distribution and retail in the city of Mawa, which in which is now twenty four point seven million more in comparison with the same period last year. Net revenue went from four point four billion reis to five point two billion reis due to the growth in the volume bills and the inclusion of the price increases mentioned, as well as with the revenue from construction that contributed for the growth of one hundred thirty two point seven million in the period. The costs, administrative expenses and commercial expenses, including the cost of construction had an increase of thirteen point eight percent, going from three point five billion in Q three twenty twenty to three point nine billion in Q three twenty twenty one. When we exclude the construction costs, the increase was fourteen point three percent or three hundred and forty seven point five million reais. Adjusted abit was two hundred and seventy-five point seven million above the bit of Q three twenty, resulting in one point eight billion in Q three twenty one a positive variance of eighteen point two percent. Now concerning be a bit the margin, which does not consider the revenue and construc for and construction costs was a little higher, going from forty four percent to forty four point four percent. The net profit, net income, closed at four hundred and eighty six point six million, eleven point one above the profit in Q three twenty, which was four hundred and twenty-one point six million reais. I'd like to stress that this increase was based on the revenue that grew in a more vigorous way, with the inclusion of recent price readjustments, a greater volume, recovery of non residential segments, thus improving the average tariff. And despite the pressure on costs and expenses due to higher inflation and also with higher interest rates and exchange variation. Now we go on to the slide for costs and expenses. The cost and expenses when we disconsider the cost of construction had an increase of fourteen point three percent or three hundred and forty seven point five million. It's important to remind you that the analysis and comparison of this quarter with that of twenty twenty in some cases may lead to distortions because many activities were paralyzed or delayed last year as a result of the measures uh for social isolation. The expenses with personnel had a small increase, 1.8%. The explanation is in the salary increase of seven point seventy five percent in May this year and medical expenses that were exceptionally s low in the previous year. This variation above the below the inflation of the period is due to the reduction of around a thousand employees. The effects of the impact of the pandemic in two hundred three twenty can also be observed with different degrees of magnitude in the expenses with materials and expenses with services. In general expenses, a significant part of the growth observed of one hundred and three million or forty five point nine percent is explained by the expenses with Court C coourturt issues fifty three point three million and the increase in accruals or provisions for payments to the environmental and infrastructure sanitation municipal funds, resulting in the growth of the revenue and the number of cities included worth thirty two point nine million. Expenses with electricity were also important. The average increase in the tariff tariffs ACR was thirty point six percent. And the impact was not greater because we migrated part of the consumption to ACL, the free environment, where the price increases were not that high. In general, the expenses with electricity had an increase of twenty point six percent, going from three hundred and eleven million to three hundred and seventy five million reis in the period. Different from the revenue that already reflects the recovery in volume and average tariffs in relation to the same period last year, the estimated losses with credit and bad debts increased by forty three point five million, a growth of fifty seven point nine percent. As mentioned by our chairman, due to the beginning of the operation of the new cor commercial system, we will have a more modern tool to approach Next slide please. Financial performance. The ground for financial performance begins with the profit in Q three twenty twenty of four hundred and twenty one point six million and shows the movement of the results in the period. Net operational revenue grew seven hundred and fifteen point four million due to tariff increases totally included growth in volume and improvement in the average tariff as already mentioned. Cost and expenses plus construction costs had an increase of four hundred seventy seven point three million. Other revenues and operational expenses, including equity, had a positive variation of two point eight million reais. This financial result presented a negative variation of one hundred ninety million due especially to the devaluation of eight point seven and eight point three percent of the Brazilian currency in comparison with the US dollar and the yen, respectively. A devaluation that is greater than the one observed in two hundred three twenty, which was three and five point two percent respectively. And also another point, the impact of the higher interest rates and also IPCA index on loans and financing. Income tax and social contribution had a negative variance of three point nine million resulting from the increase in operate net operational revenue of five hundred and eighty two point seven million, which excludes the effects of r revenue and expenses with construction, the increase in constant expenses of three hundred and forty seven point five million, and greater expenses with exchange variation one hundred and forty one point. The result was a net profit in Q three twenty one of four hundred and sixty eight point six million reais. This result, although better than the one demonstrated in the same period last year, shows that the company still has the effects of the crisis that began in twenty twenty, but we have recovered revenue not only due to higher tariffs tariff increases but also defects in the economy with the recovery in industrial segment and services. On the other hand, issues like delinquency have not followed the same trend and the strong increase in inflation can be seen in the cost of These are our comments. Now we would like to go on to the QA session. Matthew, you have the floor. Um everybody listening here, I just unmuted. Uh hello. Um okay, uh I'm taking over here so l uh uh to commit some but We would like to begin the noses. And investid. And in sequence, analysts and investors. And in function, it's possible to do that. What we can do, though we can answer in writing with the same first question preparing, let me get ready for this. For this first question, I will check with Doctor Braga. The question is from Marcello Gonçalves. He asks many questions concerning tariffs and price increases, indicators, period. And then we're going to have to do that. When will we have the tariff structure? Doctor Braga, please know please guide us. The implementation of the new tariff structure will happen in April next year and will be implemented in May. May. We'll begin in May. But I see here that there are more detailed questions on revenue and so forth. I will ask Osvaldo and Marcel uh to answer these questions to pronounce as I as well for Marcel wouldn't I respond there for Marcel I will try to answer uh And if Subespie has an expectation in relation to revenue this year, what I can say today that it is a little below the required revenue, but only at the end of December will we have the final number. We believe it'll be a a little lower, but not very much lower. Now concerning the period of evaluation of inflation, I'd like to say that our P zero was february twenty twenty one and therefore the way the a since the agency will treat this in March, let's see the index that will be used so we can adjust for inflation in the period. This will be discussed in April and implemented as of May. Now concerning tariffs, the Chairman already mentioned it will the new system will be uh implemented in May twenty twenty two. Would you like to supplement, Marcel? No? Perfect. The next question is from Gabriel Tiepo. How is the process concerning a possible privatization of the company? Doctor Bragan. Uh very well always reminding you that this topic of privatization is It's not up to us to discuss this point. I would like to say concerning the process. Our economic minister has said, everyone knows that the privatization committee of the government is analysing this topic. For the company's status, and intends to hire the IFC to prepare a study. This is the information that is public and everyone knows. I have no additional information apart from what we read in the press. Well I think We are awaiting more questions. For the time being, we had Marcelo Gonçalves. A question from Marcelo Sandi. The question is please give us an update about the investments in the new Binegos River. So please talk about their schedule, amount invested, measurement of results and expectations involving conclusion. Well, it is a great pleasure to answer this question. In October we connected four hundred and twenty eight thousand twenty three users of the five hundred and thirty We've progressed since first uh uh a We have the concrete hope to finalize until the end of twenty twenty three all the five hundred and thirty three thousand savings apart from the quality recovery units for streams that feed the Pinegos River. We have five stations, total investment one point seven billion. We are only paying by according to results. We have eighty seven percent of physical part working ready, but in terms of uh finance compared to the we're close to thirty, forty percent in terms of payments, because the payment is only made when you have the results. Water in the streams that beat the Pinetos River. So it's a project that is going very well, very successful, even during the pandemic we are going beyond the forecast, as I mentioned. The forecast was eighty five percent Okay, we have a question from Daniel Krabitsky and the question is, please comment on expansion plans for operations, participation in auctions for sanitation and expansion to other states. The company is very connected to new businesses, expansion. Doctor Osvaldo in the Financial Department has a superintendent allocated to treat this topic of new businesses. We are looking at this topic with great interest. We are focusing right now on the universalization and to reach the goals that we have in our programme for twenty thirty three. As I mentioned in my initial speech, we are We have outside consultants for M and A moviments to help us. We are we are competing for Euralandia for to take care of the city next close to Franca where we are already present, but maybe Dr. Osvaldo can supplement with some comments in terms of new businesses. Chairman, Mr Chairman, supplementing this information is basically what you mentioned. Our focus is in serving the three hundred and twenty five contracts, improving our economic and financial capacity and capex. But of course after January first when we have the confirmation of the financial capacity in the other companies, we expect some action. Especially new businesses. We're focused in looking at the opportunities first with priority to our state, Sao Paulo, and then other businesses participating in auctions together or together with other companies. We have a question from Carolyn Cab Cabriero from Credit Suisse. The question is on the implementation of the new tool for collection that Doctor Braga mentioned. Specifically, she wants to know how long will it take to implement this new tool and expectations to decrease PDD, which would happen in Q four? We a ferramenta ja the tool is already working. What we are improving are the ways the better ways to collect, more modern ways to collect which should happen in the next two, three months. In the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year we will have more news about this, using WhatsApp, using Pix for payments, all these modern tools for payments. And also more effective ways to reduce delinquency. But the tool is already working, but But these upgrades that it allows will happen in the next three, four, five months. Thank you. Right now we don't have any new questions. Uh you intend to I understand that the system identifies whether these are analysts. Doctor Branga, can we open the floor to journalists? Yes. So let's wait a little. Let's see if we receive questions. In order to clarify points. So we will wait a little. One point involving logistics. The only way to r receive questions is through the QA or do we have other ways uh to receive questions from analysts and journalists. Only through the QA. Questions only through the QA. No, no, but uh Carolina I like to do it. I didn't see Caroline's questions. Carolyn is an analyst. She had difficulty to Q and to ask her question. So she is an analyst. She has contact with the company, she sent it through WhatsApp and I read the questions. Okay, we have more questions. Doctor Braga, Doctor Oswaldo, the question is from Juliana Sigaribia. How are the recent changes having an impact on the company? How is the issue of costs? How are the costs? Very well. This question is for Dr. Osvaldo. Okay, Mr Chairman. Well in the macroeconomic system we had an increase in interest rates. This will have an impact on our costs with because of the loans we have and our debts. Now concerning the other comp issue, it's a great concern of the company this variation with higher inflation. This has put pressure on many of our costs operational costs, cost of materials, cost of electricity. We are looking at this very carefully, that's why I mentioned this point. But the costs are under control and within the goals that we had projected. Pressure exists. We are working now for this pressure not to have a great effect. I believe we have another question. I believe was already answered. He asked whether Sabesp intends to participate in sanitation. Well myself and Oswaldo we answered we're alert, we're looking at uh the possibilities we may participate as if it does not uh affect our contracts, current contracts. Now with the new regulations we have an important challenge. Marku mentioned this possibility of new businesses, but also there are serious issues because we have goals with our current contracts. That's why we're focused on reaching the goals in our contract, but as Osvaldo mentioned we are alert. We're looking at the opportunities if we can have important financial results enabling some an acceleration of the universalization in Sao Paulo we will consider the opportunities. Mario, it seems that I said that we would deliver the new Bnevas River at the end of twenty twenty three. No, I did not say that. If someone understood twenty twenty three, they understand it wrongly. Twenty twenty two. Next year clean Binegos River from our Okay. Doctor Braga, next question. Marcelo Gonçalves who will ask the questions about revenue. He wo he asks for details and clarifications. Concerning the required revenue. Is it seventeen point five billion for twenty twenty one and based on prices of is this based on prices of february twenty twenty one? Is this net revenue? In the two cases, the answer is Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. Waiting for more questions. Reminding you that uh assisting on a traduction, those who are listening to the translation in English are invited to ask questions. You may ask questions in English too. So please feel free to ask questions in English. Subespy is the innovating. Mario Sabesp is the innovative in the past we We used two of our periods to have the report in Portuguese and then in English. Now with the Zoom technology today we are doing at the same time the call and also the virtual virtual meeting in English and in Portuguese. So we are more efficient now. Yes, and this cut the cost of our conference calls. Let's see if we receive more questions. Yes, we have another question. Marianne Moraes. Could you detail the strategy how the company is financed, new loans, potential buybacks. Okay. Osvaldo, please. This would be better answered by you because you are responsible directly, so please. Mariana, thank you. I will answer in the following way. The company has an intense process of We have tried to diversify the sources of loans apart from the eventures. And with incentives, we have sought multilaterals from the private market. We had an operation. At the end of the year almost a billion reins would be devented in reais, not in foreign currency. Actually, this is a trend. The company, guided by the board and the council, is trying to reduce So our strategy is to diversify and anticipate the the loans. Now, concerning potential buybacks, we will see this when opportunities arise. But certainly the company does manage its debt and it can in the future maybe pay off the loans that are very expensive in relation to what the market is offering. The debts we have, almost all of them CDI, allow us to pay off the loans in advance, but always after a period I believe that in general terms this is it reminding you that the company has access to public multilaterals. Recently we received approval from Cofiex to for the next step for financing of two hundred million dollars. It will be in the end with Jika, the public bank that does in international development from Japan, and this is also in our pipeline. So we have some many financial loans from the public bids and World Bank. These may later be converted to rails. So we have a robust situation to guarantee the liquidity of the company and also guarantee the capex of the company to reach the goals and deliver the clean Pinedo River on the date that Doctor Braga mentioned. Thank you. Rocha asked the question and Juliana Juliana Rocha. Juliana Rosha, journalist from Reed at eleven forty six. I did not receive this question. I will read. I will read the question. I apologise. Journalists from Reed Intelligence for question details about my initial comments. Sabespy does not wait to uh have rationing. What is the scenario for twenty twenty two? What levels do you expect to have when the dr during the droughts well for then during these years we may we had three actions, three movements. One to increase the infrastructure, uh second reduce losses of water and And also to have conscious consumption from consumers. We were successful in these three. That is why today we can say that we d have no forecast for rationing of water. We are in November. In November. We're expecting more rainfall this month of November. And also during December and January, which are the rainy months. the institutes, research institutes, some saying La Niña, others do not foresee La Niña. La niña means that we would have a dry summer normal otherwise we would have a normal summer. So there are uncertainties what we have in terms of expectations is the average. What happens more frequently and therefore right now we are not we are not seeing difficulties. Now we will have no difficulties if we have a dry summer because we have alternatives to face a challenge like this one. We have experience to use technical reserves, we already use them. For your information, Cantarera Reservoir has the technical reserve, the size of the full reservoir of Guadapiranda, which is the third largest system producing water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. Therefore, we right now we don't see the need for rationing water. Now, if we have a different situation. For example, in Franca we we did this. Why? Because there next year in the first semester everything will be okay or it rained there, we have no more problems, but When we had a more difficult situation it was necessary to uh ration the water so people could fill their water reservoirs in their homes for their basic needs. But we don't have this this perspective in Sao Paulo. necessary in some palm. Okay now. Okay, now I received the question. Let's continue. We have no further questions. Dr. Braga, let's wait another three minutes to receive questions and do we conclude or do we wait more? Doctor Braga, Osvaldo. So let's let's wait another three, four minutes and if we don't have questions, we can close the conference. We have a hundred and six participants in this meeting and certainly those who have questions have already asked their questions. So Muito bem, Mario. Farewell, Mario. I believe we have no more questions. Yes, we have a question. Diego Nascimento is asking Will you announce dividends? Doctor Oswalda. Well the dividends foreseen are the the minimum and this will happen when we close our year end report we will define the company's profit and there is no we don't intend to change this. Twenty five percent the which is the minimum dividend. We have we have a strong investment plan for according to the new law and we want to really bring universalisation of these services to the state of Sao Paulo. Very well. Doctor Braga Nosvaldo, we would like to close, so I will pass the floor to Doctor Braga for his final comment.s I would like to thank our directors and our CFO and I'd like to say that we continue working hard on our challenge, especially to meet the goals and everything that is in the new law. We will continue in reducing costs, improving So this is what our company intends to do in the near future, and all those who participated may be sure that we will make our best efforts for our results to be greater, both financially and in terms of the improvement of the standard of life of people that we serve and and we supply water and sanitation. Thank you.",

      "reference" : "Okay. Good morning to all. Welcome to Sabesp's video conference to discuss the earnings for Q3. My name is Mario Sampaio. I am Head of Capital Markets and Investor Relations at Sabesp. Today, we have with us, here, Dr. Benedito Braga, Chairman of Sabesp; Mr. Osvaldo Garcia, Director, Financial Economic Director and Investor Relations; Mr. Marcello Miyagi, Head of Accounting; Marcel inaudible, Superintendent of Regu, for Regulations. Before passing the floor to Dr. Braga to begin the conference, I'd like to give some information. First, this video conference is being recorded, and the presentation will be available for download at our portal where we already have the press release. We will accept questions, only in writing, through chat. Our conference will be for an hour and 30 minutes, then we will have 45 minutes to answer questions from analysts, and, at the end, we will have time for questions from journalists. To conclude, a small disclosure: we would like to clarify that any declarations made during this conference concerning the business perspectives of the company, projections, operational and financial goals are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the company's board, and also information currently available to the company. Considerations about the future are not guarantee of performance. They involve great uncertainties, because they refer to future events and, therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operational factors may affect the future results of the company, and may lead to results that may differ materially from those expressed in these considerations about the future. Now, I would like to pass the floor to Dr. Braga. Dr. Braga, you have the floor for the opening of this conference. Thank you very much, Mario. Good morning to everyone. It's a great satisfaction to bring to you, on this rainy morning, good news to all. We had very positive financial results, but I will allow our CFO, Dr. Osvaldo Garcia, to talk about the, this point to you. I would like to begin with three or four topics that are of your interest. Also, as a result of this good news, we have a rainy morning. Concerning the water safety, we had, we are actually having a situation that is an extreme drought in the south, Southeast of Brazil. And this even affected the electricity sector, and, also, as Dr. Osvaldo may explain, issues involving cost of energy that went up as a result of this extreme drought situation that we are having. And we were able to get special authorization from the water authorities to bring from our reservoir in Salgueiro on Paraguacu River, 40 million cubic meters, these were additional, until the end of this year, and a additional 40 million cubic meters until the end of this year, thus increasing our water safety. I also inform, in this direction, talking about water safety, that the, the, uh, works or abstractions of water from Icapanao River to the reservoir in inaudible in the inaudible system may remove, or may abstract 2.5, 2.5 million cubic meters of water with a monthly average. Uh, like this, the works are going very well, and in the first semester of next year, we will have the inauguration of this supplementary system. Now, concerning rainfall, we had a month of October that was a little above average, but a month of November, in the first two weeks, a November with little rainfall, but we still have hopes that, in the second part of November, we may have more rainfall to recover our levels at reservoirs, without the need to have any extraordinary measures to guarantee the supply of water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. In the interior, we had a situation in the city of Franca, in the month of August, September, we had to begin a rationing plan. But this situation is over and, today, the supply of water in the city of Franca is normal. So, in the other cities, 375 cities, w- the situation is okay, concerning the supply of water. Another important piece of news, very important news, is the implementation of Net@, Neta. This platform will allow the new tariff structure that we have, the structure where we will have a single tariff for all our cities, and this will be applied in 2022. And reminding you that the minimum tariff disappears and we will have a fixed tariff for water connection and, plus, water consumption. So the person will only pay for what they use, but there will be a fixed fee in the new structure, in the new tariff structure. Also, through this new platform, Net@, Neta, we will have a different interaction with clients, much better interaction with payment via PIX, credit cards. In other words, a modernization, a very important modernization and update. Right now, we are implementing this system. There are some initial issues. For example, we have, we had our contact center. Also, we had a problem with fake news on, on, on inaudible, bills from Sabesp, but the Neta system has a much greater efficiency, brings this, this great efficiency and a reduction in delinquency due to the fact that we are working with taxpayer numbers, taxpayer numbers and ID numbers. Our corporate area did an excellent job, an important job, and we inaugurated this new era in terms of relationship with the clients and the monitoring of our, of our meters. So this is an important piece of news. We are modernizing the company. Now, concerning the new sanitation law and the decree that regulates Article 16, V, in terms of proving the economic financial capacity of the company as a result of the goal for 2033, concerning 99% coverage with water and also sanitation, we are very comfortable with these issues. Yes, we will have conditions to prove our financial economic capacity as a result of the following. Our largest consumers, our largest cities will not need investments in CapEx. We had already foreseen a situation of getting to universalization before 2033. Also, I can mention here that, unfortunately, the federal government did not act on time in regulating this law and published this decree with nine months, nine months late. The National Water Agency regulated other indices that we will have to follow everything, year late, but we are working hard and fast for everything to be done, everything that is from our part until December 31st. And, with this, we will be absolutely in agreement with the new law for sanitation. Finally, I would like to mention that Sabesp was the only company in the Southern Hemisphere to have an agreement with UNFCCC, which is the platform of the United Nations for climate change, where we are collaborating in this worldwide movement to increase the resilience of the water systems. We participated actively in COP26, taking our vision and showing that these discussions of the UN, the 26th, have focused a lot on the energy issue, CO2, the problems that will happen in the longterm, in the future. But they were not concerned with adaptation which is happening right now. You can see the issues concerning the drought we have in Brazil and Sabesp has been an example for the rest of the world, for the sanitation companies in the world because it prepared itself. We adapted ourselves to climate change, so it is with great satisfaction that we saw that the final report of the chairman of COP26 gave more importance to the adaptation issue. And, not only this, the next COP that will happen in Egypt next year, the focus will be on everyone adapting themselves and how this will impact and, um, and bring an improvement to the less developed countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Also, within this context of ESG, the company is alert. The company is getting stronger and stronger in this direction, ESG. Well, I believe you are more interested right now in hearing our CFO and the positive results in finance. So, Dr. Osvaldo, you have the floor. Good morning, Chairman Braga. Good morning to all. I thank you all for participating in this, uh, video conference to discuss the earnings of Q3 2021. Beginning on slight-… ' 21. Beginning on slide three, we observe the total volume build with a growth of 3.7% in relation to Q3 ' 20, this considering the volumes of Maua, which is in this quarter is working in retail. And Q3… in Q3 2020, uh, they were working in, uh, not in retail. Well, this consider the volumes that are exempt from collection and also social and residential categories in shanty towns. Going from 957.3 million to 992.7 million cubic meters built, this growth is greater in the e- in sewer services, 4.1% in relation to the volume build in the segment of water that rose 3.4%. The most significant increase happened in the non-residential categories, with… where tariffs are higher, 15.7% in public, 7% in commercial, and 6.6% in industrial clients. In the residential segment which represents the greatest volume in relation to the total, the growth was 3.2%. With a recovery of consumption in non-residential categories, we noticed a recovery in the average tariff with favorable impact on revenue. Next slide, please. Now, we'd like to see the slide with financial numbers. The revenue from sanitation services had, uh, an increase of 17.7% end of the period, going from 3. 6 billion in Q3 ' 20 to 4.3 billion reais in Q3 ' 21, especially as a result of tariff increases applied on clients' bills in August, 2020, 3.4% and since May this year, an increase of 7%. The effects are… can be seen in the revenue in this quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. Also, we add the increase of 3.7% in the total volume build, which explains the relevant increase of the total revenue of sanitation services, and the operation of water distribution in retail in the City of Maua, which in- which is now 24.7 million more in comparison with the same period last year. Net revenue went from 4.4 billion reais to 5. 2 billion reais due to the growth in the volume builds, and the inclusion of the price increases mentioned, as well as with the revenue from construction that contributed for the growth of 132.7 million in the period. The costs, administrative expenses and commercial expenses, including the inaudible construction, had an increase of 13.8%, going from 3.5 billion in Q3 2020 to 3.9 billion in Q3 2021. When we exclude the construction costs, the increase was 14.3% or 347.5 million reais. Adjusted EBITDA was 275.7 million above the EBITDA of Q3 ' 20, resulting in 1.8 billion in Q3 ' 21, a positive variance of 18.2%. Now, concerning the EBITDA margin which does not consider the revenue and construc- f- and construction cost, was a little higher, going from 44% to 44.4%. The net profit, net income closed at 486.6 million, 11.1 above the profits in Q3 ' 20, which was 421.6 million reais. I'd like to stress that this increase was based on the revenue that grew in a more vigorous way, with the inclusion of recent prices readjustments, a greater volume, recovery of non-residential segment, thus improving the average tariff, and despite the pressure on cost and expenses due to higher inflation, and also with higher interest rates and exchange variations. Now, we go on to the slide for costs and expenses. The cost and expenses when we disconsider the cost of construction had an increase of 14.3% or 347.5 million. It's important to remind you that the analysis in comparison of this quarter with that of 2020, in some cases may lead to distortions because many activities were paralyzed or delayed last year as a result of the measures, uh, for social isolation. The expenses with personnel had a small increase, 1.8%. The explanation is in the salary increase of 7.75% in May this year, and medical expenses that were exceptionally low in the previous year. This variation above the… below the inflation of the period is due to the reduction of around 1,000 employees. The effects of the impact of the pandemic in Q3 ' 20 can also be observed with different degrees of magnitude in the expenses with materials and expenses with services. In general expenses, a significant part of the growth observed of 103 million or 45.9% is explained by the expenses with court, court issues, 53.3 million, and the increase in accruals or provisions for payments to the Environmental and Infrastructure Sanitation Municipal Fund, resulting in the growth of the revenue and the number of cities included worth 32.9 million. Expenses with electricity were also important. The average increase in the tari- tariffs ACR was 30.6%, and the impact was not greater because we migrated part of the consumption to ACL, the free environment, where the price increases were not that high. In general, the expenses with electricity had an increase of 20.6%, going from 311 million to 375 million reais in the period. Different from the revenue that already reflects the recovery in volume and average tariffs in relation to the same period last year, the estimated losses with credits and bad debts increased by 43.5 million, a growth of 57.9%. As mentioned by our chairman, due to the beginning of the operation of the new cor- commercial system, we will have a more modern tool to approach and solve these balances that were not collected, were not received. Next slide, please. Financial performance. The graph for financial performance begins with the profit in Q3 2020 of 421.6 million, and shows the movement of the results in the period. Net operational revenue grew 715.4 million due to tariff increases, totally included, growth in volume, and improvements in the average tariff as already mentioned. Cost and expenses plus construction cost had an increase of 477.3 million. Other revenues and operational expenses, including equity, had a positive variation of 2.8 million reais. This financial result presented a negative variation of 190 million due s- specially to the devaluation of 8.7 and 8.3% of the Brazilian currency in comparison with the US dollar and the yen respectively, a devaluation that is greater than the one observed in Q3 ' 20, which was 3 and 5.2% respectively. And also, another point, the impact of the higher interest rate and also IPCA index on loans and financing. Income tax and social contribution had a negative variance of 3.9 million, resulting from the increase in opera- net operational revenue of 582.7 million, which excludes the effects of r- revenue and expenses with construction, the increase in cost and expenses of 347.5 million, and greater expenses with exchange variation, 141.5 million. The result was a net profit in Q3 ' 21 of 468.6 million reais. This result, although better than the one demonstrated in the same period last year, shows that the company still has the effects of the crisis that began in 2020. But we have recovered revenue, not only due to higher tariffs, tariff increases, but also the effects in the economy with the recovery in industrial segment and services. On the other hand, issues like delinquency have not followed the same trend, and the strong increase in inflation can be seen in the cost of input. These are our comments, now we would like to go on to the Q&A session. Mario, you have the floor. So everybody listening here, I just unmuted. Uh, hello. Um, okay, uh, I'm taking over here, so, uh, uh. foreign language inaudible We would like to begin our Q&A session with this. Before that, I would like to say that questions will come from analysts and investors and at the end, for journalists. As a result of time restrictions, may be some questions that we receive may not be answered. What we can do though, we can answer in writing later. I will begin with the same first question, let me get ready for this first question. I will check with Dr. Braga. The question is from Marcello Gonzalez, he asks many questions concerning tariffs and price increases, indicators period, and when will… we will have the tariff structure. Dr. Braga, please guide us. The implementation of the new tariff structure will happen in April next year, and will be implemented in May, will begin in May. But I see here that there are more detailed questions on revenue and so forth, I will ask Owsaldo and Marcel to answer these questions. Marcel. I will try to answer, please supplement. Concerning the revenue, we have… the amount is 17.5 billion reais, and if Sabeste has an expectation in relation to revenue this year, what I can say today that it is a little below the required revenue, but only at the end of December will we have the final number. We believe it'll be a little lower, but not very much lower. Now, concerning the period of evaluation of inflation, I'd like to say that our P0 was February 2021, and therefore, the way the inaudible agency will treat this in March, let's see the index that will be used. in March, let's see the index that will be used, so we can adjust for inflation in the period. This will be discussed in April and implemented as of May. Now, concerning tariffs, the chairman already mentioned, it will, the new system will be, uh, implemented in May 2022. Would you like to supplement, Marcel? No, perfect.The next question is from Gabriel Giafu. How is the process concerning a possible privatization of the company? Dr. Bragan? Very well. Always reminding you that this topic of privatization is, is up to our controller. It's not up to us to discuss this point. I would like to say, concerning the progress, it is what is public, our, our economic minister has said everyone knows that the privatization committee of the government is analyzing this topic for the company's status, and intends to hire the IFC to prepare a study. This is the information that is public, and everyone knows. I have no additional information apart from what we read in the press. Well, we are awaiting more questions. For the time being, we have Marcel Gonsalves. A question from Marcel Lucindiven. The question is, please give us an update about the investment in the new Pioneros River. So, please talk about the schedule, amount invested, measurement of results, and expectations involving conclusion. Well, it is a great pleasure to answer this question. In October, we connected 428,000 users of the 530,000 savings for this project through Pioneros River. We, since first, we have the concrete hope to finalize, until the end of 2023, all the 533,000 savings, apart from the quality recovery units for screens that feed the Pioneros River. We have five stations, total investment $1.7 billion. We are only paying by according to results. We have 87% of physical part working ready. But in terms of finance, we're close to 30, 40% in terms of payment, because the payment is only made when you have the results in terms of connections and quality of water in the streams that feed the Pioneros River. So, it's a project that is going very well, very successful, even during the pandemic. We are going beyond the forecast, as I mentioned. The forecast was 85% in October, and we have 87% ready. Okay, we have a question from Daniel Tavitsky. And the question is, please comment on expansion plans for operations, participation in auctions for sanitation and expansion to other states. The company is very connected to new businesses, expansion. Dr. Oswaldo in the financial department has a superintendent allocated to treat this topic of new businesses. We are looking at this topic with great interest. We are focusing right now on the universalization and to reach the goals that we have in our program for 2033. As I mentioned in my initial speech, we are observing this. We have outside consultants for M&A to help us. We are, we are competing for inaudible for to take care of the city next, close to Franco, where we are already present. But maybe Dr. Oswaldo can supplement with some comments in terms of new businesses. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, supplementing this information, it's basically what you mentioned. Our focus is in serving the 325 contracts, improving our economic and financial capacity and capex. But of course, after January 1st, when we have the confirmation of the financial capacity in the other companies, we expect some action, especially in new businesses. So we're focused in looking at the opportunities first with priority to our state, Sao Paolo, and then other businesses participating in auctions together or together with other companies. Okay. We have a question from Carolyn Carbagnone from Credit Suisse. The question is, on the implementation of a new tool for collection that Dr. Bragan mentioned, specifically she wants to know, how long will it take to implement this new tool, and expectations to decrease PDD, which would happen in Q4? We, the tool is already working. What we are improving are the ways, the better ways to collect, more modern ways to collect, which could happen in the next two, three months, at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, we will have more news about this using WhatsApp, using Bix for payment, all these modern tools for payment, and also more effective ways to reduce delinquency. But the tool is already working. But these upgrades that it allows will happen in the next three, four, five months. Thank you. Right now, we don't have any new questions. I understand that the system identifies whether these are analysts. Dr. Bragan, can we open the floor to journalists? Yes. So let's wait a little. Let's see if we receive questions in order to clarify points. So we will wait a little. Argue one point involving logistics. The only way to receive questions is through the Q&A, or do we have other ways to receive questions from analysts internally? Only through the Q&A. Questions only through the Q&A. I didn't see Carolyn's question. Carolyn is an analyst. She has difficulty to, to ask her question. So, she is an analyst. She has contact with the company. She sent it through WhatsApp, and I read the question. Okay, we have more questions. Dr. Bragan and Dr. Oswaldo. The question is from Julianna Sigarebia. How are the, how are the recent changes having an impact on the company? How is the issue of costs? How are the costs? Very well. This question is for Dr. Oswaldo. Okay, Mr. Chairman. Well, in the macroeconomic system, we had an increase in interest rates. This will have an impact on our costs with, because of the loans we have and our debt. Now, concerning the other issue, it's a great concern of the company, this variation with higher inflation. This has put pressure on many of our costs, operational costs, costs for materials. Cost of electricity was, had a direct impact, not only by inflation, but also the, the draft, the scarcity of water in the reservoir. We are looking at this very careful. That's why I mentioned this point. But the costs are under control and within the goals that we have projected. Pressure exists. We are working now for this pressure not to have a great effect. Okay, I believe we have another question. I believe it was already answered. Carolyn Carbagnone. She asked whether Subest intends to participate in sanitation auctions. This was answered. Maybe we can have more comments. Well, myself and Oswaldo, we answered, we're alert. We're looking at the possibilities. We may participate as, if it does not, uh, affect our contracts, current contracts. Now with the new regulations, we have an important challenge. Mario mentioned this possibility of new businesses, but also, there are serious issues, because we have goals with our current contracts. That's why we're focused on reaching the goals in our contracts. But as Oswaldo mentioned, we are alert. We're looking at the opportunities. If we can have important financial results enabling an acceleration of the universalization in Sao Paolo, we will consider the opportunities. Mario. It seems that I said that we would deliver the new Pioneros River at the end of 2023. No, I did not say that. If someone understood 2023, they understand that wrongly. 2022, next year, clean Pioneros River from our viewpoint. Okay. Dr. Bragan, next question. Marcelo Gonsalves will ask the questions about revenue. He will, he asks for details and clarifications concerning the required revenue. Is it $17. Is it 17.5 billion for 2021? And based on prices of… Is this based on prices of February 2021? Is this net revenue? In the two cases, the answer is yes. Okay. Waiting for more questions. Reminding you that those who are listening through the translation in English are invited to ask questions. You may a- ask questions in English too, so please feel free to ask questions in English. Sabeste is innovating, Mario Sabeste is innova- In the past, we used two of our periods to have the report in Portuguese and then in English. Now, with the Zoom technology, today we are doing at the same time the call and also the virtual, virtual meeting in English and in Portuguese. So we are more efficient now. Yes, and this cut the cost of our conference calls. Well, let's see if we receive more questions. Yes, we have another question. Mariana Morise, could you detail the strategy, how the company is financed, new loans, potential buyback? Okay. Oswaldo, please. This would be better answered by you because you are responsible directly, so please. Well, let me answer. Mariano… Mariana, thank you. I will answer it the following way. The company has an intense process of refinancing and loans. We have tried to diversify the sources of loans, apart from the new ventures. And with incentives, we have sought multilaterals from the private market. We had an operation at the end of the year, almost a billion reais would be to invest, in, in reais, not in foreign currency. Actually, this is the trend. The company, guided by the board and the council, is trying to reduce as possible the exchange rate exposure. So our strategy is to diversify and anticipate the, the loans. Now, concerning potential buybacks, we will see this when opportunities arise, but certainly the company does manage its debt and it can, in the future, maybe pay off the loans that are very expensive in relation to what the market is offering. The debts we have, almost all of them CDI, allow us to pay off the loans in advance, but always after a period, after the issuance. I believe that in general terms, this is it, reminding you that the company has access to public multilaterals. Recently, we received approval from ConfiX to… for the next step for financing of $200 million. It- It'll be in the end with JICA, the public bank that does in- international development from Japan, and this is also in our pipeline. So we have many loans from the public bid and World Bank. These may later be converted to reais so we have a robust situation to guarantee the liquidity of the company, and also guarantee the CapEx of the company to reach the goals and deliver the clean inaudible river of the date that Dr. Braga mentioned. Thank you. Mario, it seems that Juliana Rocha asked the question, and Juliana Rocha. Juliana Rocha, journalist from REDD at 11:46. I did not receive this question. I will read, I will read the question. I apologize. Journalist from REDD Intelligence. Her question details about my initial comments. inaudible does not wait to h- have rationing? What is the scenario for 2022? What levels do you expect to have when the d- during the droughts? Well, Juliana, during these years, we may… we had three actions, three movements. One, to increase the infrastructure, uh, second, reduce losses of water, and also to bring… uh, and also to have conscious consumption from consumers. We were successful in these three, that is why today we can say that we have no forecast for rationing of water. We are in November, we're expecting more rainfall this month of November, and also during December and January, which are the rainy months. There is a difference in climate forecast between the institutes, research institutes, some saying La Nina, others do not foresee La Nina. La Nina means that we would have a dry summer, otherwise we would have a normal summer. So there are uncertainties. What we have in terms of expectations is the average. What happens more frequently, and therefore, right now we are not, w- we are not seeing difficulties. Now, we will have no difficulties if we have a dry summer, because we have alternatives to face a challenge like this one. We have experience to use technical reserves, we already use them. For your information, Cantareira Reservoir has the technical reserve, the price of the full reservoir of Guarapiranga, which is the third largest system producing water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. Therefore, we right now, we don't see the need for rationing water. Now, if we have a different situation, for example, in Franca, we, we did this. Why? Because there, next year in the first semester, everything will be okay. It rained there, we had no more problems, but when we had a more different situation, it was necessary to ration the water so people could fill their water reservoirs in their homes for their basic needs. But we don't have this, this perspective in Sao Paulo. We're… We don't see this as necessary in Sao Paulo. Okay, now… Okay, now I received a question. Let's continue. We have no further questions. Dr. Braga. Let's wait another three minutes to receive questions, and do we conclude or do we wait more? Dr. Braga, Oswaldo, so let's, let's wait another three, four minutes, and if we don't have questions, we can close the conference call. We have 106 participants in this meeting, and certainly, those who have questions have already asked their questions. Okay. <unk> All right, well, Mario, I believe we have no more questions. Yes, we have a question. Diago Nasimento is asking, will you announce dividends? Dr. Oswaldo. Well, the dividends foreseen are the, the minimum, and this will happen when we close our year-end reports. We will define the company's profits, and there is no… We don't intend to change this 25% the… which is the minimum dividends. We have, we have a strong investment plan for according to the new law, and we want to really bring universalization of these services to the State of Sao Paulo. Very well. Dr. Braga and Oswaldo, we would like to close, so I will pass the floor to Dr. Braga for his final comments. Well, I would like to thank all the participants. I would like to thank our directors and our CFO, and I'd like to say that we continue working hard on our challenges, especially to meet the goals and everything that is in the new law. We will continue in reducing costs, improving efficiency. So this is what our company intends to do in the near future, and all those who participated may be sure that we will make our best efforts for our results to be greater, both financially and in terms of the improvements of the standard of life of people that we serve, and, and we supply water and sanitation. Thank you.",
      "withCtc" : "Okay. Good morning to all. Welcome to Sabespis Video Conference to discuss the earnings for Q three. My name is Maju Sampaio. I am head of capital markets and investor relations at Subesp. Today we have with us here the Dr. Benedict. Doctor Benedito Braga, Chairman of Subesti, Mr. Osvaldo Garcia, Director, Financial Economic Director and Investor Relations, Mr. Marcelo Miyagi, Head of Accounting, Marcelo Sanches, Superintendent of Regul for Regulation. Before passing the floor to Dr. Braga to begin the conference, I'd like to give some information. First, this video conference is being recorded and the presentation will be available for download at our portal press release where we already have the press release. will t will be for an hour and thirty minutes and we will have forty five minutes to answer questions from analysts and at the end we will have time for questions from journalists. To conclude a small disclosure. We would like to clarify that any declarations made during this conference concerning the business perspectives of the company, projections, operational and financial goals are based on beliefs and assumptions of the company's board and also information currently available to the company. Considerations about the future are not guarantee of performance. They involve risks and uncertainties because they refer to future events and Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other operational factors may affect the future results of the company and may lead to results that may differ materially from those expressed in these considerations about the future. Now I would like to pass the floor to Dr. Braga. Doctor Braga, you have the floor for the opening of this conference. Thank you very much, Mario. Good morning to everyone. It's a great satisfaction to bring to you on this rainy morning good news to all. We had very positive financial results, but I will allow our CFO, Dr. Osvaldo Garcia, to talk about the this point to you. I would like to begin with with three or four topics that are of your interest also as a result of this good news we have a rainy morning concerning the water safety. We had uh stamps we are actually having a situation. That is an extreme drought in the south southeast of Brazil, and this even affected the electricity sector. And also as Dr. Oswaldo may explain, issues involving cost of energy that went up as a result of this extreme drought situation that we are having. And we were able to get a special authorization from the water authorities to bring from our reservoir in Jaguari on Paraíba do Sul River forty million cubic meters. These are additional until the end of this year, and a additional forty million cubic meters until the end of this year, thus increasing our water safety. I also inform in this direction, talking about water safety, that the the uh works for abstraction of water from Kapanyau River to the reservoir in the Alto Tieti system may remove or may abstract two point five two point five million uh cubic meters of water with a monthly average uh uh like this the works are going very well and in the first Now concerning rainfall we had a month of October that was a little above average in terms of rainfall, but a month of November in the first two weeks But we still have hopes that in the second in the in the second part of November we may have more rainfall to recover our levels at the reservoirs without the need to have any extraordinary measures to guarantee the supply of water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. In the interior we had a situation in the city of Frenca in the month of August September we had to begin a rationing plan, but this situation is over and today the supply of water in the city of Franca is normal. So in the other cities three hundred and seventy five cities w the situation is okay concerning the supply of water. Another important piece of news, very important news, is the implementation of Nets at NETA. This platform will allow the new tariff structure that we have this structure where we will have a single tariff for all municipios, our cities application and And this will be applied in twenty twenty two uh and reminding you that the minimum character disappears and we will have a fixed tariff for water connection and plus water consumption. So the person will only pay for what they use, but there will be a fixed fee in the new structure, in the new tariff structure. Also through this new platform NATA NETA we will have uh different interaction with clients, much better interaction with payment via PIC, credit cards. In other words, a modernization, a very important modernization and update. Right now we are implementing this system. There are some initial issues. For example, we have at our contact center. Also we had a problem with fake news on on on fake bills from subestes. But the NATO system has a much greater efficiency, brings us this greater efficiency and a reduction in delinquency due to the fact that we are working with taxpayer numbers taxpayer numbers and ID numbers. Our corporate area did an excellent job, an important job, and we inaugurated this new era in terms of relationship with the clients, uh the monitorament and the monitoring of our meters. So this is an important piece of news. We are modernizing the company. Now, concerning the new sanitation law and the decree that regulates Article sixteen B uh in terms of the U.S. improving the economic financial capacity of the company as a result of the goal for twenty thirty three concerning ninety nine percent coverage with water and also sanitation. We are very comfortable uh with imposition these The issues yes. We will have conditions to prove our financial economic capacity as a result of the following. Our largest consumers, our largest cities will not need investments in CapEx. We had already foreseen getting to a situation of universalization before twenty thirty three. Also, I can mention here that unfortunately the federal government did not act on time in regulating this law and published. This decree with nine months nine months late, the National Water Agency regulated other indices. That we will have to follow everything here late, but we are working hard and fast for everything to be done everything that is from our part until december thirty first and with this we will be absolutely in agreement with the new law for sanitation. Finally, I would like to mention that Subespy was the only company in the southern hemisphere to have an agreement with UNFCC, which is the platform of the United Nations for climate change where we are collaborating in this worldwide movement to increase the resilience of the water systems. We participated actively in COP twenty six and showing that these discussions of the UN, the twenty sixth have focused a lot on the energy issue CO two the problems that will happen in long in the long term, in the future, but they uh were not concerned with adaptation, which is happening right now. You can see the issues concerning the drought we have in Brazil, and FSV has been an example for the rest of the world, for the sanitation companies in the world, because it prepared itself. We adapted ourselves to climate change. So it is with great satisfaction that we saw that the final report of the chairman of COP twenty six gave more importance to the adaptation issue. And not only this, the next COP that will happen in Egypt next year, the focus will be on everyone adapting themselves and how this will impact and im and bring an improvement to the less developed countries in the southern hemisphere. Also, within this context of ESG, the company is alert, the company is getting stronger and stronger in this direction, ESG. Well, I believe you are more interested right now in hearing our CFO and the positive results in finance. So Dr. Osvaldo you have the floor. Good morning Chairman Braga. Good morning to all. I thank you all for participating in this uh video conference to discuss your Beginning on slide three, we observe the total volume build with a growth of three point seven percent in relation to Q three twenty. This considering the volumes of Mawa, which in this quarter is working in retail and Q three in Q three twenty twenty. Uh they were working in uh not in retail. Well this considering the volumes that are exempt from collection and also social and residential categories in Shanty T. This growth is greater in the uh sewer services four point one percent in relation to the volume build in the segment of water that rose three point four percent. The most significant increase happened in the non residential categories with where tariffs are higher fifteen point seven percent in public, seven percent in commercial and six point six percent in industrial clients. In the residential segment, which represents the greatest volume in relation to the total, the growth was three point two percent. With a recovery of consumption in non residential categories, we noticed a recovery in the average tariff with favorable impact on revenue. Next slide, please. Now we'd like to see the slide with financial numbers. The revenue from sanitation services had an increase of seventeen point seven percent in the period, going from three point six billion in Q three twenty to four point three billion RAIS in Q three twenty one, especially as a result of tariff increases applied on clients' bills. In August twenty twenty, three point four percent, and since May this year, an increase of seven percent. The effects are can be seen in the revenue in this quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. Also, we add the increase of three point seven percent in the total volume built, which explains the relevant increase of the total revenue of sanitation services and the operation of water distribution and retail in the city of Mawa, which in which is now twenty four point seven million more in comparison with the same period last year. Net revenue went from four point four billion reis to five point two billion reis due to the growth in the volume bills and the inclusion of the price increases mentioned, as well as with the revenue from construction that contributed for the growth of one hundred thirty two point seven million in the period. The costs, administrative expenses and commercial expenses, including the cost of construction had an increase of thirteen point eight percent, going from three point five billion in Q three twenty twenty to three point nine billion in Q three twenty twenty one. When we exclude the construction costs, the increase was fourteen point three percent or three hundred and forty seven point five million reais. Adjusted abit was two hundred and seventy-five point seven million above the bit of Q three twenty, resulting in one point eight billion in Q three twenty one a positive variance of eighteen point two percent. Now concerning be a bit the margin, which does not consider the revenue and construc for and construction costs was a little higher, going from forty four percent to forty four point four percent. The net profit, net income, closed at four hundred and eighty six point six million, eleven point one above the profit in Q three twenty, which was four hundred and twenty-one point six million reais. I'd like to stress that this increase was based on the revenue that grew in a more vigorous way, with the inclusion of recent price readjustments, a greater volume, recovery of non residential segments, thus improving the average tariff. And despite the pressure on costs and expenses due to higher inflation and also with higher interest rates and exchange variation. Now we go on to the slide for costs and expenses. The cost and expenses when we disconsider the cost of construction had an increase of fourteen point three percent or three hundred and forty seven point five million. It's important to remind you that the analysis and comparison of this quarter with that of twenty twenty in some cases may lead to distortions because many activities were paralyzed or delayed last year as a result of the measures uh for social isolation. The expenses with personnel had a small increase, 1.8%. The explanation is in the salary increase of seven point seventy five percent in May this year and medical expenses that were exceptionally s low in the previous year. This variation above the below the inflation of the period is due to the reduction of around a thousand employees. The effects of the impact of the pandemic in two hundred three twenty can also be observed with different degrees of magnitude in the expenses with materials and expenses with services. In general expenses, a significant part of the growth observed of one hundred and three million or forty five point nine percent is explained by the expenses with Court C coourturt issues fifty three point three million and the increase in accruals or provisions for payments to the environmental and infrastructure sanitation municipal funds, resulting in the growth of the revenue and the number of cities included worth thirty two point nine million. Expenses with electricity were also important. The average increase in the tariff tariffs ACR was thirty point six percent. And the impact was not greater because we migrated part of the consumption to ACL, the free environment, where the price increases were not that high. In general, the expenses with electricity had an increase of twenty point six percent, going from three hundred and eleven million to three hundred and seventy five million reis in the period. Different from the revenue that already reflects the recovery in volume and average tariffs in relation to the same period last year, the estimated losses with credit and bad debts increased by forty three point five million, a growth of fifty seven point nine percent. As mentioned by our chairman, due to the beginning of the operation of the new cor commercial system, we will have a more modern tool to approach Next slide please. Financial performance. The ground for financial performance begins with the profit in Q three twenty twenty of four hundred and twenty one point six million and shows the movement of the results in the period. Net operational revenue grew seven hundred and fifteen point four million due to tariff increases totally included growth in volume and improvement in the average tariff as already mentioned. Cost and expenses plus construction costs had an increase of four hundred seventy seven point three million. Other revenues and operational expenses, including equity, had a positive variation of two point eight million reais. This financial result presented a negative variation of one hundred ninety million due especially to the devaluation of eight point seven and eight point three percent of the Brazilian currency in comparison with the US dollar and the yen, respectively. A devaluation that is greater than the one observed in two hundred three twenty, which was three and five point two percent respectively. And also another point, the impact of the higher interest rates and also IPCA index on loans and financing. Income tax and social contribution had a negative variance of three point nine million resulting from the increase in operate net operational revenue of five hundred and eighty two point seven million, which excludes the effects of r revenue and expenses with construction, the increase in constant expenses of three hundred and forty seven point five million, and greater expenses with exchange variation one hundred and forty one point. The result was a net profit in Q three twenty one of four hundred and sixty eight point six million reais. This result, although better than the one demonstrated in the same period last year, shows that the company still has the effects of the crisis that began in twenty twenty, but we have recovered revenue not only due to higher tariffs tariff increases but also defects in the economy with the recovery in industrial segment and services. On the other hand, issues like delinquency have not followed the same trend and the strong increase in inflation can be seen in the cost of These are our comments. Now we would like to go on to the QA session. Matthew, you have the floor. Um everybody listening here, I just unmuted. Uh hello. Um okay, uh I'm taking over here so l uh uh to commit some but We would like to begin the noses. And investid. And in sequence, analysts and investors. And in function, it's possible to do that. What we can do, though we can answer in writing with the same first question preparing, let me get ready for this. For this first question, I will check with Doctor Braga. The question is from Marcello Gonçalves. He asks many questions concerning tariffs and price increases, indicators, period. And then we're going to have to do that. When will we have the tariff structure? Doctor Braga, please know please guide us. The implementation of the new tariff structure will happen in April next year and will be implemented in May. May. We'll begin in May. But I see here that there are more detailed questions on revenue and so forth. I will ask Osvaldo and Marcel uh to answer these questions to pronounce as I as well for Marcel wouldn't I respond there for Marcel I will try to answer uh And if Subespie has an expectation in relation to revenue this year, what I can say today that it is a little below the required revenue, but only at the end of December will we have the final number. We believe it'll be a a little lower, but not very much lower. Now concerning the period of evaluation of inflation, I'd like to say that our P zero was february twenty twenty one and therefore the way the a since the agency will treat this in March, let's see the index that will be used so we can adjust for inflation in the period. This will be discussed in April and implemented as of May. Now concerning tariffs, the Chairman already mentioned it will the new system will be uh implemented in May twenty twenty two. Would you like to supplement, Marcel? No? Perfect. The next question is from Gabriel Tiepo. How is the process concerning a possible privatization of the company? Doctor Bragan. Uh very well always reminding you that this topic of privatization is It's not up to us to discuss this point. I would like to say concerning the process. Our economic minister has said, everyone knows that the privatization committee of the government is analysing this topic. For the company's status, and intends to hire the IFC to prepare a study. This is the information that is public and everyone knows. I have no additional information apart from what we read in the press. Well I think We are awaiting more questions. For the time being, we had Marcelo Gonçalves. A question from Marcelo Sandi. The question is please give us an update about the investments in the new Binegos River. So please talk about their schedule, amount invested, measurement of results and expectations involving conclusion. Well, it is a great pleasure to answer this question. In October we connected four hundred and twenty eight thousand twenty three users of the five hundred and thirty We've progressed since first uh uh a We have the concrete hope to finalize until the end of twenty twenty three all the five hundred and thirty three thousand savings apart from the quality recovery units for streams that feed the Pinegos River. We have five stations, total investment one point seven billion. We are only paying by according to results. We have eighty seven percent of physical part working ready, but in terms of uh finance compared to the we're close to thirty, forty percent in terms of payments, because the payment is only made when you have the results. Water in the streams that beat the Pinetos River. So it's a project that is going very well, very successful, even during the pandemic we are going beyond the forecast, as I mentioned. The forecast was eighty five percent Okay, we have a question from Daniel Krabitsky and the question is, please comment on expansion plans for operations, participation in auctions for sanitation and expansion to other states. The company is very connected to new businesses, expansion. Doctor Osvaldo in the Financial Department has a superintendent allocated to treat this topic of new businesses. We are looking at this topic with great interest. We are focusing right now on the universalization and to reach the goals that we have in our programme for twenty thirty three. As I mentioned in my initial speech, we are We have outside consultants for M and A moviments to help us. We are we are competing for Euralandia for to take care of the city next close to Franca where we are already present, but maybe Dr. Osvaldo can supplement with some comments in terms of new businesses. Chairman, Mr Chairman, supplementing this information is basically what you mentioned. Our focus is in serving the three hundred and twenty five contracts, improving our economic and financial capacity and capex. But of course after January first when we have the confirmation of the financial capacity in the other companies, we expect some action. Especially new businesses. We're focused in looking at the opportunities first with priority to our state, Sao Paulo, and then other businesses participating in auctions together or together with other companies. We have a question from Carolyn Cab Cabriero from Credit Suisse. The question is on the implementation of the new tool for collection that Doctor Braga mentioned. Specifically, she wants to know how long will it take to implement this new tool and expectations to decrease PDD, which would happen in Q four? We a ferramenta ja the tool is already working. What we are improving are the ways the better ways to collect, more modern ways to collect which should happen in the next two, three months. In the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year we will have more news about this, using WhatsApp, using Pix for payments, all these modern tools for payments. And also more effective ways to reduce delinquency. But the tool is already working, but But these upgrades that it allows will happen in the next three, four, five months. Thank you. Right now we don't have any new questions. Uh you intend to I understand that the system identifies whether these are analysts. Doctor Branga, can we open the floor to journalists? Yes. So let's wait a little. Let's see if we receive questions. In order to clarify points. So we will wait a little. One point involving logistics. The only way to r receive questions is through the QA or do we have other ways uh to receive questions from analysts and journalists. Only through the QA. Questions only through the QA. No, no, but uh Carolina I like to do it. I didn't see Caroline's questions. Carolyn is an analyst. She had difficulty to Q and to ask her question. So she is an analyst. She has contact with the company, she sent it through WhatsApp and I read the questions. Okay, we have more questions. Doctor Braga, Doctor Oswaldo, the question is from Juliana Sigaribia. How are the recent changes having an impact on the company? How is the issue of costs? How are the costs? Very well. This question is for Dr. Osvaldo. Okay, Mr Chairman. Well in the macroeconomic system we had an increase in interest rates. This will have an impact on our costs with because of the loans we have and our debts. Now concerning the other comp issue, it's a great concern of the company this variation with higher inflation. This has put pressure on many of our costs operational costs, cost of materials, cost of electricity. We are looking at this very carefully, that's why I mentioned this point. But the costs are under control and within the goals that we had projected. Pressure exists. We are working now for this pressure not to have a great effect. I believe we have another question. I believe was already answered. He asked whether Sabesp intends to participate in sanitation. Well myself and Oswaldo we answered we're alert, we're looking at uh the possibilities we may participate as if it does not uh affect our contracts, current contracts. Now with the new regulations we have an important challenge. Marku mentioned this possibility of new businesses, but also there are serious issues because we have goals with our current contracts. That's why we're focused on reaching the goals in our contract, but as Osvaldo mentioned we are alert. We're looking at the opportunities if we can have important financial results enabling some an acceleration of the universalization in Sao Paulo we will consider the opportunities. Mario, it seems that I said that we would deliver the new Bnevas River at the end of twenty twenty three. No, I did not say that. If someone understood twenty twenty three, they understand it wrongly. Twenty twenty two. Next year clean Binegos River from our Okay. Doctor Braga, next question. Marcelo Gonçalves who will ask the questions about revenue. He wo he asks for details and clarifications. Concerning the required revenue. Is it seventeen point five billion for twenty twenty one and based on prices of is this based on prices of february twenty twenty one? Is this net revenue? In the two cases, the answer is Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. Waiting for more questions. Reminding you that uh assisting on a traduction, those who are listening to the translation in English are invited to ask questions. You may ask questions in English too. So please feel free to ask questions in English. Subespy is the innovating. Mario Sabesp is the innovative in the past we We used two of our periods to have the report in Portuguese and then in English. Now with the Zoom technology today we are doing at the same time the call and also the virtual virtual meeting in English and in Portuguese. So we are more efficient now. Yes, and this cut the cost of our conference calls. Let's see if we receive more questions. Yes, we have another question. Marianne Moraes. Could you detail the strategy how the company is financed, new loans, potential buybacks. Okay. Osvaldo, please. This would be better answered by you because you are responsible directly, so please. Mariana, thank you. I will answer in the following way. The company has an intense process of We have tried to diversify the sources of loans apart from the eventures. And with incentives, we have sought multilaterals from the private market. We had an operation. At the end of the year almost a billion reins would be devented in reais, not in foreign currency. Actually, this is a trend. The company, guided by the board and the council, is trying to reduce So our strategy is to diversify and anticipate the the loans. Now, concerning potential buybacks, we will see this when opportunities arise. But certainly the company does manage its debt and it can in the future maybe pay off the loans that are very expensive in relation to what the market is offering. The debts we have, almost all of them CDI, allow us to pay off the loans in advance, but always after a period I believe that in general terms this is it reminding you that the company has access to public multilaterals. Recently we received approval from Cofiex to for the next step for financing of two hundred million dollars. It will be in the end with Jika, the public bank that does in international development from Japan, and this is also in our pipeline. So we have some many financial loans from the public bids and World Bank. These may later be converted to rails. So we have a robust situation to guarantee the liquidity of the company and also guarantee the capex of the company to reach the goals and deliver the clean Pinedo River on the date that Doctor Braga mentioned. Thank you. Rocha asked the question and Juliana Juliana Rocha. Juliana Rosha, journalist from Reed at eleven forty six. I did not receive this question. I will read. I will read the question. I apologise. Journalists from Reed Intelligence for question details about my initial comments. Sabespy does not wait to uh have rationing. What is the scenario for twenty twenty two? What levels do you expect to have when the dr during the droughts well for then during these years we may we had three actions, three movements. One to increase the infrastructure, uh second reduce losses of water and And also to have conscious consumption from consumers. We were successful in these three. That is why today we can say that we d have no forecast for rationing of water. We are in November. In November. We're expecting more rainfall this month of November. And also during December and January, which are the rainy months. the institutes, research institutes, some saying La Niña, others do not foresee La Niña. La niña means that we would have a dry summer normal otherwise we would have a normal summer. So there are uncertainties what we have in terms of expectations is the average. What happens more frequently and therefore right now we are not we are not seeing difficulties. Now we will have no difficulties if we have a dry summer because we have alternatives to face a challenge like this one. We have experience to use technical reserves, we already use them. For your information, Cantarera Reservoir has the technical reserve, the size of the full reservoir of Guadapiranda, which is the third largest system producing water in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo. Therefore, we right now we don't see the need for rationing water. Now, if we have a different situation. For example, in Franca we we did this. Why? Because there next year in the first semester everything will be okay or it rained there, we have no more problems, but When we had a more difficult situation it was necessary to uh ration the water so people could fill their water reservoirs in their homes for their basic needs. But we don't have this this perspective in Sao Paulo. necessary in some palm. Okay now. Okay, now I received the question. Let's continue. We have no further questions. Dr. Braga, let's wait another three minutes to receive questions and do we conclude or do we wait more? Doctor Braga, Osvaldo. So let's let's wait another three, four minutes and if we don't have questions, we can close the conference. We have a hundred and six participants in this meeting and certainly those who have questions have already asked their questions. So Muito bem, Mario. Farewell, Mario. I believe we have no more questions. Yes, we have a question. Diego Nascimento is asking Will you announce dividends? Doctor Oswalda. Well the dividends foreseen are the the minimum and this will happen when we close our year end report we will define the company's profit and there is no we don't intend to change this. Twenty five percent the which is the minimum dividend. We have we have a strong investment plan for according to the new law and we want to really bring universalisation of these services to the state of Sao Paulo. Very well. Doctor Braga Nosvaldo, we would like to close, so I will pass the floor to Doctor Braga for his final comment.s I would like to thank our directors and our CFO and I'd like to say that we continue working hard on our challenge, especially to meet the goals and everything that is in the new law. We will continue in reducing costs, improving So this is what our company intends to do in the near future, and all those who participated may be sure that we will make our best efforts for our results to be greater, both financially and in terms of the improvement of the standard of life of people that we serve and and we supply water and sanitation. Thank you."

      "baseline" : "Maybe we can start that Simon? Uh yeah, I just admit two more. I think we're uh yeah, we we have uh we can start definitely. Perfect. All right, so I will do the introduction. Thank you everyone for being with us today. I'm recognizing a lot of names that we uh that have been following Urban Immersive for uh quarter to quarter. So uh it's a pleasure to uh see you again today. Uh for those who don't know me, my name is Sain Amir. I'm the CEO, co-founder of Urban Immersive. Welcome to our fourth quarter financial result, end of the year, investors Conerenfce call. Bienvenue à notre appel conference and we're finally trimestiling for the fin d'année 2021. For a reason of being efficient and stay efficient and respect our time. We'll be doing this call in English. But we will take both English and French questions at the end. Joining me today, as usual, I have Simon Bedar, our CFO, and I'm just looking at my screen and I see François Huguenge, our new uh executive vice president. During the call, we might make forward-looking statements during future financial performance, operations, products, and events. Although we believe our expectations are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these results. So again, we caution you to read and consider all the risk factors described in our last MDNA. If not, it's gonna be on CDAR pretty soon or in our annual information forum that you can find on CDAR again. So the agenda will be quite uh different slightly different, sorry, uh compared to the last quarter. So what we want to do is uh Simon will uh start by um going to the um last quarter and year end financial highlights. He will talk about some business highlights as well. And then afterwards what uh we thought that you could appreciate today because it's the end of the year, we're starting a new year. Um we thought that, you know, we would take sixteen minutes and do a short uh urban immersive deck presentation so that, you know, we can put everyone on the same foot in regard our in regards of um how the management is seeing urban narrative, how we describe it and what is, you know, our focus and goals uh going forward. So without further ado, I will turn the call to Simon. Simon. Hi, good afternoon everyone. Uh we see we have a lot of uh participants, investors today. So thanks for uh your interest in being uh present on that uh on that call today. Um so what I like to do is um similar to what I've done in the last quarter, just maybe put some uh some color into uh the uh financials that were uh published in the press release this morning. Um I want to apologize. The i we don't have the the FIDER filing yet, but the French version should be available uh within the next hour from uh my friends at Grant Tardan are telling me. Uh sorry they had some some quality uh issues, uh quality control issues this morning. And the English version should follow um within forty eight uh hours. That said, if you have more detailed questions with regards to those financial statements where once they're available in CDAR rally, feel free to contact me uh by phone or email and I will answer uh all questions you have uh with regards to our uh our financials. So um in terms of uh our our uh Q four and two thousand twenty one uh financial resort to start with uh if we talk about revenues uh for the year we end up uh we close the year at slightly above four million in revenues compared to four four point six uh last year. So it's uh eleven percent uh decrease. Uh that decrease is um I would say in is explained in most cases by the uh the decrease in sales of three D uh photography equipment. Uh that was expected uh by the way by by six hundred thousand. If you remember last year, uh well we were pretty happy to have to have acquired uh email solutions uh and benefit from the good uh a solid year of the demand for ki three D cameras uh in the the beginning of the pandemic, but we knew that the won't last uh it won't be sustainable uh over the years. Sorry, there's someone uh Yeah. That was the young food. Okay. We're we're back. Uh yeah, so uh so that was expected. Uh that of course w we'll go back to a a normal level of sales. Uh what is this normal level? Maybe next year we can expect some some time something around two to four hundred thousand dollars, but not what we've seen at the beginning of the pandemic where people were had time to to buy cameras and try it and basically uh uh th there was a a a a boom, but that was a one time thing, so we don't expect this to continue. Um uh uh on the side, uh if we look at the SaaS uh SAS sales, we're uh we're down seven percent uh compared to last year. But uh of course we we you may know that we're uh our company is still today uh uh mostly transactional uh driven, but you know, in terms of the revenues transactional based, meaning that yes, we're progressively moving to s some uh some revenue um recurring revenue streams with the new subscription package that we have that Justin will talk about a bit later. But still today with we're heavily transactional based and and the fact that the market is uh in terms of number of transactions, in terms of number of listings, uh, is down just this year compared to last year, thirty near to thirty percent or twenty-three percent that's in uh Canada with centrists, but in the US it's also in that range, so between twenty-five to thirty percent. And if you remember last year we were down thirty percent. So if you accumulate that, we're basically down sixty percent over two years in terms of uh again uh inventory and number of transactions. Uh i it if you combine this to uh a very quick turnover ratio where properties and and houses are sold most of the time within twenty four to thirty eight hours, uh and they don't eat that much of marketing tools, uh, because they can sell it pretty easily. That's just another factor uh that uh we're facing right now. We we think that all this of course should be temporary. We don't have a crystal ball, well we're gonna be back to a uh normal market. But just to um to uh put things in perspective, uh talking about Centuries. We're uh right now I think we have around thirty five thousand listing um uh on uh on centrist. We used to have one hundred twenty at that time usually so it's uh of course we we're affected by this but the fact that we're seven percent down uh in that type of market uh I think it's it's positive. We uh we're even gaining customers. We're not losing customers at all. We're gaining customers uh with our new subscription package and uh on all different fronts. So uh so uh that's why I it's important to understand uh the the market here when we uh we look at the at our at our numbers. Also uh also what you have what's important this in the last quarter is that you'll see that we have our first quarter of uh s photo service. Uh we have revenues of three hundred seven, three hundred seven thousand of uh photo service. We had uh those acquisitions, if you remember, were on June thirtieth, so we have only one quarter uh this year, but uh but the ones that were acquired in June have maybe uh uh represent approximately one point eight million on an annual basis of revenues. Plus uh of course the ones that you've seen that we acquired in Q one two thousand twenty two in November and December, meaning that today uh I'm not here to to make guidance of what's gonna be our revenues next year, but based on what d those all those companies that we've acquired have done in the last twelve months where as we posted on our website, we uh we are at uh run rate revenues of approximately uh eleven million. And out of this eleven million we have roughly three million in SaaS. Uh as I said, half a million maybe in hardware uh and uh and the seven and a half million remaining is uh is is photoservice. Uh so even Q one, uh twenty twenty two, you can expect that we'll have maybe uh two to four weeks of revenues of those uh new acquisitions that were done in November, December, we we won't have the full effect even in Q one. We will do have in uh in Q two. So um and if we uh and if we talk about Q four, Q four we're uh our revenues were one point one million compared to one point four last year. So we're down uh twenty four uh percent on Q four. But we're seeing that the number of listing have decreased more in Q four this year. That's overall over the year as, my as mentioned we,'re we uh that was in terms of the number of listing inventory that was down thirty percent. So still I think we're doing pretty good uh in this uh very challenging market. Um talking about uh three D tours, uh that's that's a positive thing on our end is that uh we see we experience a lot a lot of growth in the number of three D tours. Uh in fact two two hundred thirty seven percent compared We're talking maybe in dollars around uh roughly around seventy to eighty thousand dollars of new uh of revenues of three D tours this year, and that should continue to grow fast because we uh you may have seen a few uh few updates we provided uh before Christmas with regard to new contracts, including OfferPad, for instance, uh that should scale up and and deploy uh more and more cities over over the months. So we should see uh that trend should continue to uh in terms of number of territories to grow uh fast in the next uh in the next month. That's what we expect. Um talk in terms about of gross margin, uh we're pretty stable compared to last year. Uh for the three month period we were at sixty one percent overall compared to sixty three uh last year. And for the year, uh, we're at sixty five compared to sixty eight. So pretty stable. Of course, it depends on the mix of the revenues, uh, because on the SAS SAS portion our our gross margin is somewhere between eighty two and eighty seven percent. And on the service, photoservice, uh more thirty-five to forty, and on the equipment is a bit lower. So depending depending on the uh the mix, of course, that will affect our gross margin. But basically this should be representative of next year and even probably we could improve that a little bit uh when we're gonna talk about uh some efficiency efficiency gains that we'll we will have uh with the uh synergies and acquisition. uh you know we can see we have a a loss of three point seven uh million for the year but uh uh including three point two million of other expenses. And out of that three point two there's three million or two point nine in fact that comes from uh all the adjustments made with regards to the conversion of the venture, the the convertible the ventures that are all gone as you know uh as of today. So uh this is is not recurring, so uh won't be there uh next year, but uh there was just a one-time uh um uh journal entries this year. But of course that uh uh that explained most of why we uh we have this that loss for uh for the year. Um in terms of uh balance sheet, uh we're uh we're we're still in pretty good shape. In fact uh as you know we we did a a three million private placement in April uh we uh that we use for uh for in in part for our acquisitions. Um we uh at the end of September we had two million of liquidities. I can s I can tell you that as of today we're near a million, so we use that uh an additional million for the acquisitions that were done completed in November and December. Uh so uh we're uh we're pretty we we we're still in good shape. We have enough to operate and execute our our uh our business plan, no problem. there Of course with that million that will serve as a as a as a cushion going forward. So uh we don't expect to use more than that on on acquisition unless we uh we we we we we uh you know we raise additional capital or or or debt or or or some some external funding. Um and other than that, uh as you know, throughout the year we've uh we've eliminated our convertible debuters. That was uh we reduce our debt in fact by four point seven million uh throughout the year including four point five uh just for the convertible the ventures. Uh so uh so basically again I think our balance sheet is in good shape. And uh yeah, that's pretty much the point I wanted to cover. Um there's in DM DNA and financial you'll have some information by segment uh where we now track three different segments. Uh one is the software, uh one is the uh photography equipment and one is the service. So uh so again uh hopefully I I'll be able to to to post it on CDR pretty soon so you can come back to me if you have further questions. And on that, uh I think I I'll turn the mic to you, Gislay, if you uh if you want to maybe give a a a bus a quick a business update through the presentation. Absolutely, uh Simon, but just before we jump to the next point on the agenda, uh is there anyone who would like to ask specific questions about financial that uh Simon just covered? Or uh you still think about your questions and you're gonna keep it for the end. It's like you want, you know, we can take a couple of minutes just to go over and uh clear the uh the financial side of it if you want. Otherwise, you know, we're just gonna keeping continuing. So we're seeing any question right now I will say you raise your hand but you're just everybody is kind of uh closing his camera so I'm not seeing every anyone. I just have one uh slice. Um uh Simon you mentioned that uh you currently have about a million in cash and you're not uh using uh any more cash for acquisitions, so um how should we think about the acquisition strategy going forward? Um since you know the there there's been a decline in the stock price, so um maybe it's not as attractive uh uh anymore um to pay to pay in shares or to raise uh raising more more cash uh by issuing new shares. So how do you think about that? Uh yeah but I mean we're not uh as you've seen we've closed eight acquisition uh or six acquisition just in December. So right now we're on the uh dig integration phase. It's going very well. Uh just we'll cover that in a in a sec. Uh so we're we're not we're not a week or two to basically uh uh uh uh announce a new uh acquisition. So and we s we do have a lot of uh things on our plate really. So we're pretty optimistic about what's coming and and of course hopefully the uh uh the the the market will also be uh more on the red than on the green. So basically all to say is that we uh by the time we uh we're back on track with acquisition we we think and we hope that uh our our start price would be at the higher levels. Yeah, perfect, thank you. And if it's not, then we can also, you know, kind of uh just delay some of the deals or or look for uh any uh any other kind of structure uh to close those deals. Any other question or we move forward to uh just open your mic if you want to ask a question to uh Simon and uh just ask your question. You're more than welcome. And like I said, you know, we're gonna keep answering questions uh at the end. So I promise, all right, I'm gonna go into a deck. It's very seldom that we're doing that on the conference call, investor conference call. I think it might be the first time if I do uh remember, but uh I promise it will be short. I'll try to do it in ten minutes. Hopefully I will not lose everyone. But uh ten minutes to fifteen just covering fifteen, twenty slides. And the reason why we wanted to do it is that we were getting a lot of calls, and I uh and uh through those calls we are realizing that um we often have to um uh kind of realign the storytelling with some investors who think we're uh some investors think we are a metaverse business, some investors think that we're just a photography business and so on and so forth. So I think that uh the goal of this uh this deck is uh is kind of uh redefining for uh for everyone, you know, I see defining for everyone, you know, on the same page uh what is is urban immersive and where we're going. So I'm gonna share my screen in a second. Hopefully, you're all gonna see it, except if you're uh on your cell phone and what's um on a smaller device, you might have some problems seeing it. So I'm gonna comment those slides. here Just gonna click on the part of presentation. So like Simon said, this is um the way we describe urban immersive on on uh the TSX on our website. Um we're basically a technological business, uh technology business that provides services in the market of real estate society. Put it in other words, I like to say that we're a tech-powered real estate society business. That's another way to present Urban Immersive. Run rate of $11 million, and today, you know, including the photographers who are on the repayroll, um paper job and on their payroll, we're uh turning around one hundred and fifteen employees. If you can do the head office with uh the developers and uh the management and everything, we're probably f turning around around thirty employees. We're based in Montreal. Uh and of course we're listening on C S adventure. So this is I I don't want go into detail, but I just want to remind people that we're not a startup. I mean we've been in this business for uh more than ten years and the first thing that my brother and I did uh ten years ago was to design this spaceship kind of prototype of mild lens camera, but it was a real prototype by the way. And in two thousand nine we tried to um raise money to commercialize business. And uh this is why in twenty twelve we kind of jumped on the TSX vureent at that time in here in Canada and Quebec's particularly we were having access to a a tax kind of advantage for an investor called RIA so to uh to raise money. But uh this camera never s the light, so we kind of uh um create all the software uh surrounding CD Tour. But you know, we're not newcomers. We've we've been trying a lot of things in the real estate supply for business uh from developing cameras software, business solutions, so on and so forth. So we know you know the business pretty well. And some of the engineers working with me to develop those software, I've been working with them for more than twenty five years. So this is our set. This is not something you're gonna find on the market, but you know when we sit down and try to evaluate what is the size of our market and our market is real estate or core market. Of course at the end of the day we'll talk about addressable markets, but our core market is real estate photography. For the purpose of marketing. So basically, you know, to sell a house. So when we consider that activity for residential, commercial and rentals, we are estimating that this is a an a niche market of four billion dollars just in the uh in north America. Potentially in our estimation, something about seven to eight billion dollar world wild. Here in North America, we're estimating about thirty million shoots a year. Shoot for us as a photographer, taking a star and do it, shoot a house and bring back twenty five, thirty five uh images with all the uh media that comes with that. And roughly that's provide generates a billion images per year. So that's our this is our market. Like Simon said, this is a transactional market. I mean, our business is linked to the housing inventory. So if the housing inventory ramp up, we're gonna ramp up. If it's going down because our business model, as we're gonna see in this slide, is mostly nine percent transactional based, we're gonna follow the trend. And unfortunately right now the trend is uh historic co uh actually it's historic. Uh the uh most of the MLS we talk with they never saw such a low inventory of house for sales. Uh you know, I'm not sure I like those numbers the way I'm presenting it today, but those are real. I mean the market is down twenty three percent, urban urban receipt is down eleven percent year over year. And our new acquisition or are just coming into, you know, our pipeline of revenue uh in the last quarter. So if you take just the SaaS, like Simon said, minus seven percent. Overall, we feel we're winning clients. Uh we don't feel that we're losing clients, but we we what we're saying is that our photographers, our clients are doing less business overall. So this is why I mean, you know, it's kind of um uh of a a bad place to be right now. But you know, I'm a positive person and um I don't think it's gonna get worse. Uh and uh we're hearing that you know the interest rate should increase, so that will kind of uh uh hopefully uh slow down a little bit, you know, the um uh some of the interest of uh buyers uh uh or people selling a house. In any cases I think we kind of the uh we are at the bottom of the of the barrier right now. So I think it's that the situation will just come go start and ramping up again. And of course like uh Simon said, you know, we potentially sixty percent uh down compared to what sh numbers should usually be in terms of uh listings in terms of house for sales. So our vendor ship should follow the trends and and potentially just, you know, uh beat the transaction because we believe right now we're beating, you know, we're kind of uh succeeding in that very, very difficult market. I can tell you what's certainly I'm talking to a lot of uh entrepreneurs in the real estate uh space, and they're all in the same position right now. All right, so the photoship business in itself, it's a it's a business that is transforming a lot and it's definitely shifting to a technology driven, high volume business. So basically you have to do a lot of transactions per day because it's a highly competitive landscape and you need to bring a lot of value in terms of technology. So basically we kind of you know spread all the parts that you need to succeed in photography business, like we need to have online booking system, you need to have the capture hardware, not just a camera, but then you might need a three D camera, you might need a a drone, so you need to have those specialized hardware. You need to uh post is it your images to increase you know the the the the the white balance to put a blue sky on uh on the external uh facade uh images so you need to have this service you need to create youtube video slideshows because YouTube is one of the the most popular search engine in real estate. Of course, you need to provide 3D tours, it's a must-have today. And for plan is kind of, I will say basically more important than the three D tours right now. on the market There's a lot of interest, even in some states, like here in Canada, fore plants are mandatory. Uh this is a common product. It's uh you know, you definitely need to provide websites, we call it property website. So it's a website dedicated to showcase one house for sale. You need a system to deliver one and five images, high quality images. You know images cannot be just transferred by email. So you need to have some sort of a solid system to transfer your image and you need a very performant payment system to get paid. When you look at all those things that you need to run a photography business today. Urban Earth is the only company offering and owning every part of uh the uh the every every portion, every technology required to the business uh right now. And that's giving us uh a lot of advantages over over our competition. I will start from the bottom. Of course, the after sales support is easier for Ben Russia to do because we're providing each part. We're not relying to third party for three D tours, for floor plans, for photo editions, everything is done internally. So of course we have a pretty difficult to be turnaround every time. We can deliver uh faster than our competitors because they're fewer uh parties involved. We can we have more flexibilities in our packages we can offer and deal with our our clients. We keep our margins pretty high for the value we bring and you know, we we like to tell the market that we uh we are one of the most competitive uh business right now in terms of pricing. So being a one stop shop is definitely bringing a lot of value to our clients and it's positioning or Ben Immersive for winning many deals, many contracts with real estate agents and offers. The business model, when you look at each of the parts, there's some portion of those um those um required um elements that you need to run a uh a photography business that are not technology, like you know, taking a picture, you need to have a human doing that, you need to have a photographer. Uh photo editing an images, you know, even if AI is super well advanced and you know a lot of people tell that they are photo edit editing images with computers, you still have some humans. The humans will do a better job. And the floor plans, you need a dr somebody draw to draw floor plans with and put furniture write the rooms name and stuff like that. Those services we are offering it to our clients. So we call them service on demand and it is transactional based. So each time somebody wants to have a photographer on site, uh the the the client pay and send a photographer, send things for photo edition and foreclans. And the rest is mostly technology, so and we're still offering it every part, even if there's no uh line with the booking system we we are offering it. And it's still transactional uh most uh of uh for most of the parts. So we're charging, for example, five dollars to render a a site should be or four dollars to render a 3D tours, uh, fifteen dollars to create a property website, and uh three dollars to transfer the image. So you need to think about this part here as a drop box drop box kind of uh platform to transfer the high quality majors. We added this year a new service that Simon briefly talked during the financial highlights, what we call the Prime Subscription. So the prime subscription is basically for $30 a month. Agents can subscribe to that plan. And each time they order one of our photographers, we're gonna bundle all the technologies uh we can offer. to them So this is a very popular um subscription right now or it's uh and we will talk a little bit uh later in the deck uh about it. Simon briefly talked about the distribution revenues, so three million in SaaS, eight million dollars in uh services. I just want to add uh for the SaaS we're still uh serving around seventeen hundred uh real estate topopers. So this number here is our independent photographers using our technologies to serve their agents, their clients. They're generating around two hundred six thousand probability websites per year. In terms of services, so we're talking about our photographers, we're serving around twelve thousand real estate agents and doing around fifty thousand shoots a year, pull shoots a year. So basically, this is including all our acquisitions that we've done uh during 2021. When we talk about technology and you saw it from the uh history, uh the timelines of uh Urban Immersive, you know, we started with the three sixty camera design we're still passionate passionate, hot highly passionate about three D technology. We'll always kind of keep that uh in our products and and really kind of uh hope that someday you know three D tours will will get back on the market. And this is the this and what COVID nineteen has created, generated a demand for three tours, this is our core technology. And we believe that we have right now one of the most complete 3D tour solutions on the market. If you look at uh the all the features we are offering, uh few companies can um can uh uh state that they have have all this in their three solution. So of course we're each time we're doing a three D tour, we're providing a dollhouse. This is the way you know we commonly uh call all this kind of uh three D tours and room segmentations. We can measure uh um on the floor and and with tape. Uh we're having our own built-in four-plan drawing software built in in the 3D tour itself. So even our clients can play with it and can change the uh the four plans if they want. So there's it if we're not using AutoCAD, we're not using a third-party software to create our fall plans. We use uh the AI powered um the classification system uh that we acquired from Tourbus in 2018 to uh automatically put a tag in rooms to say this is a fitness room, a kitchen, so on so forth. We have those tags also that you can put some graphic and links, some crawling that hotspot, 3D hotspot. This is pretty unique to Urban Immersive. So we are showing an interactive map of people within the room. This is not picture of people actually, it's a real video. So you can see, you know, people in their um in the live stream video on the map. And of course we have the avatars, so the three D social spaces where you can visit with friends and interact with them. So whether you can interact uh by chatting or you can interact with video conferencing. The next slide is uh something pretty special for us because you know we we are running a photography business and we are offering phot uh photography services and we want to be highly efficient and the only way you can achieve um profitability and keep your margins by going fast. You need to do a shoot super fast. Being two hours in the house, you know, it's uh it's it's too long. So we want our photographers to do six to seven shoots per per day. And in order to do that, we developed our own capture app that is three times faster than anything else that we've seen on the market to to uh scan a house. It works on iPhone, iPad, it used advanced computer vision alignment system to uh create those maps when you shoot. It's fully integrated within our workflow, so it's definitely uh improving uh the productivity of our people. And it also we also have some features that enable photographers to add uh additional uh information on the map uh for uh adding value um in post production. We recently launched this uh this uh uh what we call the automated uh building and sites and analytics report. So for every tour we uh providing with our prime subscription, people will receive a detailed report about the property. So they will know how many sink showers the uh the the building has, how many doors, uh outside doors, inside doors, and so on and so forth. So it's uh highly detailed and uh really appreciated with some of our clients, like OfferPad, for instance, that are refurnishing uh many of the homes they're they're uh buying to resell them. Um this is unique to urban immersive. We call it UI Meet 3D. So basically it's the avatar that you you know you can see people visiting the home with you in the 3D space, and we just open their video camera so it becomes some sort of a three D video conference. I will tell you that uh we're presenting UI meet three D to many um uh industry leaders and uh it's making a lot of noise right now and we're expecting to have some um significant uh uh partnership to announce soon. Uh many of the people in within the industry and as you see I'm not using that word today, but we've been told and people are telling us that it might be the version one point zero after all of metaverse. You know, being able to be all together uh within an environment visually interacting, uh where you are with within the space, what you're looking at and with the video system. Uh it's um definitely something that um has a lot of value for our clients, partners, MLSs, brokers, and so on. And we have filed four provisional patents on that. And basically the reason why we uh we use a provisional patent is basically because we wanted to go fast in protecting our ideas and also we want to make sure that nobody will patent something on top of our ideas that you know basically will um for force us to not uh you know promote this technology. So so far uh we have four provisional patterns on that. We're working on the fifth one. It's basically related to the way we're presenting avatars when there are multiple people on the same axis, the way we are controlling uh user group control user group experience and so on and so forth. And um about the 3D tour, uh we have today what we believe one of the most complete 3D marketing website suite on the market. So basically it's those are websites dedicated to show to showcase the the best way possible 3D tours. We have more than 20 customizable designs. Uh we accept other media like still pictures, video and and so on. So it's um it's it's a solution that is highly um appreciated by our clients because once you have 3D tours, you need to distribute it, you need to promote it, and we have a complete solution to that. The way you know we run a fast business, uh we uh over the years at November 2013, actually, we started developing our own business solution, ERP or CRM, whatever you want to call it. It's a system that helps managing a photography business. And today we're using it to manage our own today business. And what is particular with our solution is that we've developed over the years a business intelligence allowing to create instant booking. Uh what does it mean? It means that we can in real time, without any delays, find the closest photographers for the next shoot. So when an agent comes our platform and they want to book a photographers at two o'clock Saturday, the system will find the right photographers for the right services for the right client at two o'clock, and the booking is confirmed. There's no other communication. They will be sure that the photographers will be there. So the system calculate the uh the uh the the travel time, calculate the service time. And at the end of the day it gave us, you know, uh the possibility to uh to uh improve the productivity of the businesses we are acquiring. To give you an example, one the business we acquired, they were doing three point five shoots a day, uh and today they're running at seven shoots a day with this system. So we see rapidly the difference uh using our system. Oh and I like to say this is an autonomous algorithm. You know behind that we don't we don't use Google uh map or any other uh software. It's our own business intelligence. In terms of on-demand services, it's a recap. So we are offering to e scanning and photography services, portland drawing, image announcements. It's all paper jobs. And in terms of photography, we have uh w a around one hundred thirty real estate photographers. Uh it's difficult to know, you know, the exact numbers because some photographers are working twenty hours, some photographers are working forty hours or the full time, part-time, whatsoever, but they offering the uh complete package of uh you know uh visual content capturing 3d scanning uh on one appointment basically our photographers are um um are are equipped to deliver all the services of urban immersive. Forpland drying is done offshore. Most of the parking drying is done in Paris, uh was the most, maybe fibefty 50 fi fty50, 50% is done here in Quebec using our own software. And we like to say that we've developed uh some sort of a marketplace so we can um uh engage uh really rapidly new people to work on our system and to help you know with the volume. Photo edition is the same uh and right now as with as we speak we are doubling our uh photo edition uh team in Paris. Um the reason is that because uh some of the businesses that we have acquired uh recently are paying with uh offshore uh companies three times what it costs us to uh post uh edit images. So we expect to increase the margins of uh uh of uh our uh one some of our biggest acquisitions that we've done with sampling. There, um my man uh is there a we can just No, I'm trying to. It looks like uh you succeeded to uh shut it down and we're terribly sorry about that. It's the first time it's happening. We've been hacked uh on that call. Uh are you hearing me? Yeah, okay. So first time, perfect experience. So it's not us, it's not played by Rebel Mercy. Hopefully, you know that. And hopefully those uh young guys that uh have a lot of fun. But it's uh try to to mute Samuel Mantes, uh Simon, if you can. I see Samuel Mantes. Can you just sit down? Uh what? And uh Marie also. Yeah. So we're sorry for that. We're gonna try to uh get back to our meeting, otherwise we're gonna have to terminate that. So are we good to continue or are we g'reonna have other people. Can you stop ac i I think I don't know how it we're zoomed assignment, but can you stop uh people getting on the call? Yeah. Well alright, let's close it uh Simon. Let's close the call. Okay. Sorry everyone. And with next time we'll use Shut a fuck up, Kiseline. Shut a fuck up. We'll use something else. Close that call. Goodbye.",

      "reference" : "Maybe we can start, uh, Simon? Uh. Yeah. I just admit two more. I think we're, uh… Yeah, inaudible we have, uh… We can start, definitely. Perfect. All right. So, I will do the introduction. Thank you everyone for being with us today. I'm recognizing a lot of names that we, uh… That have been following Urbanimmersive for uh, quarter to quarter. So uh, it's a pleasure to, uh, see you again today. Uh, for those who don't know me, my name is Ghislain Lemire. I'm the CEO, co-founder of Urbanimmersive. Welcome to our fourth quarter financial result, end of year investors' conference call. Um, French. For a reason of being efficient inaudible efficient and respect our time, we'll be doing this uh, call in English. Uh, but we will take both English and French questions at the end. Joining me today, uh, as usual, uh, I have uh, Simon Bedard, our CFO. And I'm just looking at, uh, my screen, and I see Francois Liberge, our new, uh, executive vice president. During the call, we might make forward looking statements during future financial performance, operations, products inaudible. Although, we believe our expectations are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these results. So again, we caution to read and consider all the risks factors described in our last MD&A. If not, it's gonna be on SEDAR pretty soon or in our annual information form that you can find on SEDAR again. So, the agenda will be quite uh, different, slightly different… Sorry, uh, compared to the last quarter. So, what we wanna do is uh, Simon will, uh, start with by um, going to the uh, last quarter and year end financial highlights. He will talk about some business highlights as well. And then afterwards, what uh, we thought that could appreciate today… Because it's the end of the year, we're starting a new year, um, we thought that, you know, we will take 15 minutes and do a short, uh Urbanimmersive deck presentation so that, you know, we can put everyone on the same foot, uh, in regard our… In regards of the, how the management is seeing Urbanimmersive, how we describe it, and what is, you know, our focus and goals uh, going forward. So, without further ado, I will turn the call to Simon. Simon. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Uh, we see have a lot of uh, participants, investors, today. So, thanks for uh, your interest in being uh, present on that uh, on that call today. Um, so, what I'd like to do is similar to what I've done in the last quarter, just maybe put some uh, some color into uh, the uh, the uh, financials that were, uh, published in the press release morning. Um, I want to apologize. The i-… We don't have the, the SEDAR filing yet. But the French version should be available uh, within the next hour from, uh, my friend inaudible telling me. Uh, sorry, they had some, some quality issues, uh quality control issues this morning. And the English version should follow uh, within 48 uh, hours. That said, if you have more detailed questions with regards to those financial statements, wer- once they're available in SEDAR, really feel free to contact me, uh, by my phone or email. And I will answer uh, all questions you have uh, with regards to our uh, our financials. So, um, in terms of uh, our, our uh, Q4 and 2021 uh, financial result. To start with, uh, if we talk about revenues, uh, for the next year, we end up, uh… We closed the year at slightly above 4 million in revenues compared to 4, 4.6 uh, last year. So, it's a 11% uh, decrease. Uh, that decrease is uh, I would say, i- is explained in most cases by the, uh, the decrease in sales of 3D uh, photography equipment. Uh, that was expected, uh, by the way, by, by, by 600,000. If you remember, last year, uh, well, we were pretty happy to have, to have acquired, uh ImmerSolution, uh, and benefit from the good… A, a solid year of demand for c- 3D cameras, uh, at, at the beginning of the pandemic. But we knew that the crosstalk uh, it won't be sustainable uh- crosstalk. uh, over the year. Sorry. There's someone, uh- inaudible. Okay. We're back. Uh, yeah. So uh, so, that was expected, uh that, of course, we'll, we'll go back to a, a normal level of sales. Uh, what is this normal level? Maybe next year, we can expect some, sometime- something around two to $400,000, but not what we've seen in the beginning of the pandemic where people were, had time to, to buy cameras and try it. And basically uh, uh, that was a, a, a, a boom. But that was a onetime thing. So, we don't expect this to continue. Um, uh, uh, on the side, uh, if we look at the SaaS, uh, SaaS sales, we're uh, we're down 7% uh, compared to last year. But uh, of course, we, we… You may know that we're uh… Our company's, still today, uh, uh, mostly transactional, uh, driven. Uh, but, you know, in terms of the revenues, transactional based, meaning that yes, we're progressively moving to s- some uh, some revenue um, recurring streams with the new subscription package that we have inaudible we'll talk about a bit later. But still, today, we, we're heavily transactional based. And, and, and the fact that the market is uh, in terms of number of transaction, in terms of number of listings, uh, is down just this year compared to last year, 30, near to 30% or 23%. That's in, uh, Canada with Centrist. But in the US, it's also in that range, so between 25 to 30%. And if you remember last year, we were down 30%. So, if you can accumulate that, we're basically down 60% over two years in terms of uh, again, uh, inventory and number of transactions. Uh, i- and if you combine this to a, a very quick turnover ratio where properties and, and houses sold most of the time, within 24 to 48 hours, uh, they don't need that much of marketing tools uh, because they sell it inaudible. That's just another factor, uh, that uh, we're facing right now. We, we think that inaudible of course, should be temporary. We don't have a crystal ball, Well, we're gonna be back to, a normal market. But just to um, to uh, put things in perspective, I was talking about Centrist. We're uh… Right now, I think we have around 35,000 listings, um, uh, on uh, on Centrist. We used to have 120 at that time, usually. So, it's uh… Of course, we, we're affected by this. But the fact that we're 7% down uh, in that type of market, uh, I think it's, it's positive. We uh, we're even gaining customers. We're not losing customers inaudible we're gaining customers, uh, with our new subscription package inaudible all different fronts. So uh, so uh, that's why, uh, it's important to understand, uh, the, the market here when we, uh, we look at the, at our uh, at our numbers. Also uh, also, what you have… What's important this… In the last quarter is that you'll see that we have our first quarter of uh, s- photo service. Uh, we have revenues of 307, 300- uh, 7000 of uh, photo service. We had, uh… Those acquisition, if you remember, were on June 30th. So, we only one quarter, uh, this year. But uh, but the ones that were, uh, acquired in June have maybe, uh, uh… Represent approximately 1.8 million on an annual basis of revenues plus, uh, of course, the one that you've seen that we acquired in Q1 2022, in November and December, meaning that today, uh, I'm not here to, to make guidance of what's gonna be our revenues next year.But based on what the- those, all those company that we acquired has done in the 12 months, we're… As we posted on our website, we uh, we are at, uh, run rate revenues of approximately uh, 11 million. And out of this 11 million, we have roughly 3 million in SaaS. Uh, as I said, half a million maybe in hardware, uh, and uh, and the seven and a half million remaining is uh, is, is photo service. Uh, so, even Q1 uh, 2022, you can expect that we'll have maybe, uh, two to four weeks of revenues of those uh, new acquisitions that were done in November, December, we, we have the full inaudible do have, in uh, in Q2. So, um, and if we uh, and if we talk about Q4, Q4, we're uh… Our revenues were 1.1 million compared to 1.4 last year. So, we're down uh, 24 uh, percent on Q4. But we've seen number of the listing have decreased more in Q4 this year. But overall, over the year, as m- as mentioned, we're, we uh… There was… In terms of the number of listing and inventory, that was down 30%. So, still, I think we're doing pretty good, uh, in this very challenging market. Um, talking about, uh, 3D tours, uh, that's, that's a positive thing uh, on our end is that uh, we see… We experience a lot, a lot of growth in the number of 3D tours. Uh, in fact, two- 237% compared to Q4 last year. Uh, we're talking maybe in dollars, around uh, roughly around 70 to $80,000 on new, uh, uh… Of revenues of 3D tours this year. And that should continue to grow fast because we uh… You may have seen a few uh, few updates. We provided that before Christmas with regards to new contracts including inaudible for instance. Uh, that should scale up, uh, and deploy uh, m and more cities over, over the month. So, we should uh, that trend should continue to uh, in terms of number of 3D tours to grow, uh, fast in the next, in the next month. That's what we expect. Uh, talk, in terms about gross margin, uh, we're pretty stable compared to last year. Uh, for the three months period, we were at 61% overall compared to 63, uh, last year. And for the year, uh, we're at 65 compared to 68. So, pretty stable. Of course, it depends on the mix of the revenues, uh, because on the SaaS, SaaS portion, our, our gross margin is somewhere 82 and 87%. And on the service, photo service, uh, more 35 to 40. And on the equipment, it's a bit lower. So, depending, depending on the, uh, the, uh, the mix, of course, that will affect our gross margin. But basi-… um, the, uh, the mix, of course, that will affect our gross margin, but basically this should be representative of next year. And even probably we could improve that a little bit. Uh, when we gonna talk about, uh, some efficiency gains that we'll, we will have, uh, with the, uh, synergies and acquisitions that you say will cover a bit more, uh, a bit more or later. Um, in terms of, uh, net income, uh, there's a lot of noise this year, uh, on the, uh, you know, we can see, we have a, a loss of 3.7, uh, million for a year, but, uh, uh, including 3.2 million of other expenses and out, out of that 3.2 there's 3 million or 2.9, in fact, that comes from, uh, all the adjustment made with regards to the conversion of the, the venture, the, the convertible ventures that are all done as you know, uh, as of today. So, uh, this is, is none a recurring, so, uh, won't be there next year, but, uh, there was just a one time, uh, uh, uh, journal entries this year, but of course that, uh, uh, that explained most of why we, uh, we have that, that loss for, uh, for the year. Um, in terms of, uh, balance sheet. Uh we're uh, we're, we're still in pretty good shape. In fact, uh, as you know, we, we did a, a 3 million private placement in April. Uh, we, uh, that we use for, uh, for, in part for our acquisitions. Um, we, uh, at the end of September, we had 2 million of liquidities. I can, I can tell you that as of today, we're near 1 million. So we use that, uh, an additional 1 million for the acquisition that were done completed in November and December. Uh, so we're, uh, we're pretty, we, we're still in good shape. We have enough to operate and execute our, our, uh, our business plan. No problem there, of course, with that 1 million that will serve as a, as a, as a cushion going forward. So, uh, we don't expect to use more than that on, on acquisition, unless we, uh, we, we, we, we, we, uh, you know, raise additional capital or, or, or debt or, or, or some external funding. Um, uh, and other than that, uh, as you know, throughout the year, we've, uh, we've eliminated our convertible debentures. That was, uh, we reduce our debt in fact by 4.7 million, uh, throughout the year, including 4.5, uh, just for the convertible debentures. Uh, so, so basically again, I think our balance sheet is in good shape and, uh, yeah, that's pretty much the point I wanted to cover. Um, there's in dm, DNA and financial, you'll have some information by segment, uh, where we now track three different segment. Uh, one is the software. Uh, one is the, uh, photo equipment, and one it is the service. So, uh, so again, uh, hopefully I'll be able to, to, to post it on Cedar pretty soon. So you can come back to each after your questions and on that, uh, I think I'll turn the mic to you, Josiah, if you, uh, if you want to maybe give a, a, a bi- a quick business update through the presentation. Absolutely. Yeah. Simon, but just before we jump to the next point on the agenda, uh, is there anyone would like to ask a specific questions about financial that, uh, Simon just covered? Or, uh, you still think about your questions and you're gonna keep it for the end. It's like you want, you know, we can take a couple of minutes just to go over and, uh, clear the, uh, the financial side of it, if you want, otherwise, you know, we're just gonna keep in continuing. So we're seeing any question right now, I will say, raise your end, but you're just, everybody is kind of, uh, closing his camera. So <laugh> I'm not seeing eve- anyone. I just have one, uh, question. crosstalk. Okay. It's Mathew here. Yes, sir. Um, uh, Simon, you mentioned that, uh, you currently have about 1 million in cash and you're not, uh, using any more cash for acquisitions. So, um, how should we think about the, the acquisition strategy going forward? Um, since, you know, the, the, there's been a decline, the stock price, so, um, maybe it's not as attractive, uh, anymore, um, to pay, to pay in shares inaudible more cash by issuing new shares. So how do you think about that? Uh, yeah, but I mean, we're not, uh, as you've seen with closed eight acquisition, uh, or six acquisition just in December, so right now we're on the interg- integration phase. It's going very well, as you say, we'll cover that in the, in the sec. Uh, so we're, we're not, we're not a week or two to basically, uh, uh, uh, announce a new, uh, acquisition. So, and we, we do have a lot of, uh, things on our plate really, so we're pretty optimistic about what's coming and, and of course, hopefully the, uh, uh, the, the market will also be, uh, more on the red than on the green. So basically all to say is that we, uh, by that time, we, uh, we're back on track with acquisition we, we think and we hope that, uh, our, our stock price would be at higher levels. <laugh> Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. And if it's not, then we can also, you know, kind of, uh, just delay some of the deals or, or look for, uh, any, uh, any other kind of structure, uh, to close those deals. Any other question, or we move forward to, uh… just open your mic, if you wanna ask the question to, uh, Simon and, uh, just ask your question, you're more than welcome. And like I said, you know, we are gonna keep answering questions, uh, at the end. So I promise, right? I'm going to go into a deck. It's very seldom that we're doing that on the conference call, investor conference call. I think it might be the first time if I do, uh, remember, but I promise we'll be short. I'll try to do it in 10 minutes. Hopefully I will not lose everyone, but, uh, 10 to 15 minutes, just covering 15, 20 slides. And the reason why we wanted to do it is that we were getting a lot of calls Simon and I, uh, and, uh, through those calls, we are realizing that, um, we often have to, um, uh, kind of realign the storytelling with some investors. We think we're, uh, some investors think we are middle business. Some investors think that we're just a path business and so on and so forth. So I think that, uh, the goal of this, uh, this deck is, is kind of a redefining for, uh, for everyone. You know, I see defining for everyone, you know, on the same page, uh, what it is Urbanimmersive and where we're going. So I'm gonna share my screen in a second. Hopefully you all gonna see it, except if you, you on your cell phone and what's, um, on a smaller device, you might have some problem seeing it, so I'm gonna comment those slides here. Just gonna click on the part presentation. So, like Simon said, this is, um, the way we describe Urbanimmersive on, on the, the share specs on our website. Um, we're basically a technological business, a te- a technology business that provides services in the market of real estate precise. Um, put it not a word, I like to say that we're a tech-powered real estate supply business. That's inaudible. Um, run rates of $11 million and today, you know, including the photographers who are on their payroll, um, paper job, and on their payroll, we turning around 115 employees, if you can do the head office, but the developers and the management, everything, we're probably turning around of the employees. We based in Montreal. Uh, and of course, we're listed in Montreal inaudible. So this is, <laugh> I don't wanna go in detail, but I just wanna remind people that we're not as startup. I mean, we've been in this business for, uh, more than 10 years. And the first thing that my brother and I did, uh, 10 years ago was to design this spaceship kind of prototype of mill to end camera, but it was a real prototype by the way. And in 2009, we tried to, um, raise money to commercialize business. And, uh, this is why 2012 to kind of jump in a tears adventure at that time. And here in Canada and inaudible per clearly, we were adding access to a, a tax kind of advantage for an investor called Ryan, so to, uh, to raise money, but, uh, this camera never s- the light. So we kind of, uh, um, create all the software, uh, surrounding 3D tour. But, you know, we're not in newcomers. We've, we've been trying a lot of things in the real estate supply business, uh, from developing camera software, business solutions, so on, so forth. So we know, you know, the business pretty well. And some of the engineers working with me to develop those software, I've been working with them for more than 25 years. So this is our stats. This is not something you gonna find on market, but, you know, when we sit down and try to evaluate what is the size of our market. And our market is real estate or core market, of course, at the end of the deck, we'll talk about addressable markets, but our core market is real estate photography, for the purpose of marketing. So basically, you know, to sell a house. So when we considering that activity for residential, commercial and rental, we are estimating that this is a, a niche market of $4 billion just in the, uh, in North America, potentially in our estimation, something about 7 to $8 billion worldwide. Here in north America, we're estimating about 30 million shoots a year, shoot for us as photographer taking a star and go and shoot a house and bring back 25, 35, uh, images with all the, uh, media that comes with that. And roughly that provide generates 1 billion images per year. So that's our, this is our market. Like Simon said, this is a transactional market. I mean, our business is linked to the housing inventory. So if the housing inventory ramp up, we're gonna ramp up if it's going down, because our business model, as we gonna see in this slide is mostly 9% transactional-based, we're gonna follow the trend. And unfortunately, right now the trend is a history, actually it historic. Uh, they, uh, most of the, unless we talk with, they never saw such a low inventory of house for sales. Uh, you know, I'm not sure I like those numbers the way I'm presenting it today, but those are real. I mean, the market is down 23%. Urban, Urbanimmersive is down 11% year over year. And our new acquisition, or are just coming to, you know, our pipeline of revenue in the last quarter. So if you take just the stats like Simon said, minus 7% overall, we feel we're winning clients. Uh, we don't feel- We feel we're winning clients. Uh, we don't feel that we're losing clients, but we, we, what we're saying is that our photographers, our clients are doing less business overall. So this is why, I mean, you know, it's kind of, um, uh, of a, uh, a bad place to be right now, but, you know, I'm a positive person and, um, I don't think it's gonna get worse. Uh, and, uh, we're hearing that, you know, the interest rate should increase. So that will kind of, uh, uh, hopefully, uh, slow down a little bit, you know, the, um, uh, some of the interest of the buyers, uh, or people sending our house in any cases. I think we kind of the, uh, where the bottom, the, of the barrier right now. So I think it, that dissertation will just come, go start and ramping up again. And of course, like, uh, Simon said, you know, we potentially 60%, uh, down compared to what numbers should usually be in terms of, uh, listings in terms of house for sales. So inaudible should follow the trends and, and potentially just, you know, uh, beat the transaction because we believe right now we're beating, you know, we're kind of, uh, succeeding in that very, very difficult market. I can tell you what's certain, I'm talking to a lot of, uh, entrepreneurs in the real estate, uh, states and they all in the same position right now. All right. So the stock business in itself, it's a, it's a business that is transforming a lot, and it's definitely shifting to a technology driven, high volume business. So basically you have to do a lot of transactions per day because it's a highly competitive landscape and you need to bring a lot of value in terms of technology. So basically we kind of, you know, spread all the parts that we need to succeed in product business. Like you need to have online booking system. You need to have the capture hardware, not just the camera, but the, you might need the 3D camera. You might need a, a drone. So you need to have those visualized hardware. You need to, uh, post it di- images to increase, you know, the, the, the, the, the wide balance to put a blue sky on, on the external, uh, facade, uh, images. So you need to have this service. You need to create YouTube video slideshow, because YouTube is one of the, the most popular search and giant in real estate. Of course, you need to provide 3D tours. It's the must have today. And floor plan is kind of, I will say, basically more important in the 3D tours right now in the market. There's a lot of interest, even in some states like here in Canada, floor plans are mandatory. Uh, this is a common product. It's a, you know, you definitely need to provide website. We call it Property Website. So it's a website data to showcase one house for sale. You need a system to deliver 100 images, high quality images. You know, it, images cannot be just transferred by emails. So you need to have some sort of a study system to transfer your image, and you need a very performance, uh, payment system to get paid. When you look at all those things that you need to run a photography business today, Urban Asset is the only company offering and owning every part of, uh, the, uh, the, every, every portion, every technology required to the business right now. And that's giving us, uh, a lot of advantages over, over our competition. I will start from the bottom. Of course, the after sale support is easier for Urban Assets to do because we're providing each part. We're not relying to third party for 3D tours, for floor plans, for photo editions, everything is done internally. So of course we have a pretty difficult to beat turnaround every time. We can deliver, uh, faster than our competitors, because they're fewer, uh, parties involved. We can, we have more flexibility in our packages. We can offer and deal with our, our clients. We keep our margins pretty high for the value we bring. And, and, you know, we, we like to tell the market that we, uh, we are one of the most competitive, uh, business right now in terms of pricing. So being a one stop shop is definitely bringing a lot of value to our clients and it's positioning or been immersive for winning, uh, many deals, many contracts with real estate agents and other offers, The business model, when you look at each of the parts, there's some portion of those, um, those, uh, required, um, elements that you need to run a, a photo business that are not technology, like, you know, taking a picture, you need to have a human doing that you need to have a photographer. Uh, photo is ed- editing and image is, you know, even if AI is super well advanced, and you know, a lot of people tell that they are photo editing images with computer, you still have some human, the human will do a better job. And the floor plans, you need to dr- somebody draw to draw floor plans w- and put furnitures, write the rooms name, and stuff like that. Those services we offer, bring it to our clients. So we call them Service on Demand, and it is transactional based. So each time somebody wants to have a photographer on, on, on site, uh, the, the, the client pay, send a photographer sending for photo edition and floor plan. And the rest is mostly technology. So, and we still offering it every part, even if there's no, uh, line with the booking system. We, we are offering it, and it's still transactional, uh, most of, uh, for most of the parts. So we're charging, for example, $5 to render a slide to bill, $4 to render a 3D tours, uh, $15 to trade a property website and, uh, $3 to transfer the images. So think about this part here as a Dropbox, Dropbox kind of, uh, platform to transfer the high quality images. We added this year, a new service that Simon that briefly talked during the financial ally, what we call the Prime Subscription. So the Prime Subscription is basically for $ 30 a month. Agents can subscribe to that plan. And each time we order one of our photographers, we're gonna bundle all the technologies, uh, we can offer to them. So this is a very popular, um, subscription right now where it's, uh, and well will talk a little bit later in the deck about it. Simon briefly talked about the distribution of revenues. So $3 million in stock, $8 million in, uh, services. I just want to add, uh, for the stock is still, um, serving around 1700, uh, real estate photographers. So this number here is our end, end photographers using our technologies to serve their agents, their clients is generating around 206,000 probably website per year. In terms of services, so we're talking about our photographers. We're serving around 12,000 real estate agents and doing around 50,000 shoots a year, call it shoots a year. So basically this is including our acquisition that we've done, uh, during 2021. When we talk about technology and new site from the, uh, history, uh, the timelines of urban immersive, you know, we started with the 360 camera design, we still passion, passionate, hi- highly passionate about 3D technology. We're always kind of keep that, uh, in our products and, and, and really kind of, uh, hope that someday, you know, 3D tours will, will get back on the market. And this is definitely what COVID-19 has created, generated a demand for 3D tours. This is our core technology. And we believe that we have right now, um, one of the most complete 3D tour solution on the market. If you look at, uh, the, all the features we are offering, uh, few companies can, um, can, uh, uh, state that they have have all this in their 3D solution. So of course, we're each time we're doing a 3D tour, we are providing a dollhouse… This is the way, you know, we commonly, uh, call all this of, uh, 3D tours and room limitation. We can measure, uh, um, on the floor and, and with tape, uh, we're having our own builtin floor plan drawing software built in, in the 3D tour itself. So even our clients can play with it and can change the, uh, the four plan if they want. So there it, we are not using other card. We're not using a third party software to create a floor plan. We use, uh, the AI powered, um, the classification system, uh, that we acquired from Toolbars in 2018 to, uh, automatically, uh, uh, put a ta- a tag in rooms to say, this is a fitness room, a kitchen, so on and so forth. Uh, we, you have those tag also that you can put some, uh, graphic and links. Um, some are calling that hotspot, 3D hotspot. This is pretty unique to urban immersive. So we are showing an interactive map of people within a room. This is not picture of people, actually, it's a real video. So you can see, you know, people in their, um, in their livestream video on the map. And of course we have the avatars. So the 3D social spaces where you can visit with friends and interact with them. So whether you can interact, uh, by chatting, or you can interact with video conferencing. Um, the next slide is, uh, something pretty special for us because, you know, we are, we are running a photography business. Uh, we are offering, uh, photography services and we want to be highly efficient. And the only way you can achieve, um, profitability and keep your margins by going fast, you need to do a shoot super fast. Being two hours in the house, you know, it's, uh, it's, it's too long. So we want our photographer to do six to seven shoots per, per day. And in order to do that, we develop our own capture app that is three times faster than anything else that we've seen on the market to, to, uh, scan a house. It works on iPhone, iPad. It use advanced computer vision alignment system to, uh, create those map when you shoot. It's fully integrated within our workflow. So it's definitely, uh, improving, uh, the productivity of our people and it, so we also add some features, uh, that enables offers to add, uh, additional, uh, information on the map, uh, for, uh, adding value, um, improve production. W We recently launched this, uh, this, what we call the automated, uh, building and site and report. So for every tour we, uh, providing with our Prime Subscription, people will receive a detailed report about the property. So they will know how many sink, showers the, uh, that the building has, how many doors, uh, outside doors, inside doors and so on and so forth. So it's, uh, highly detailed, and, uh, really appreciated with, uh, some of our clients like Offerpad, for instance, that are refurnishing, uh, many of- Clients like inaudible, for instance, that are refurnishing many of their homes. They, they're buying to resell them. Um, this is inaudible. Uh, we call it inaudible. So basically, it's, uh, the added side is, you know, you can see people visiting the home with you in the 3D space. And we just opened the video camera, so it becomes some sort of 3D video conference. And I'll tell you, uh, that we're presenting inaudible to many, um, uh, industry leaders and, uh, it's making a lot of noise right now, and we're expecting to have some, um, significant, uh, partnership to announce soon. Um, many of the people within the industry, and as you see I'm not using that word today, but we've been told, and people are telling us that it might be the Verkshum 1.0 after all, of Metaverse. You know, being able to be all together, within an environment, visually interacting, uh, where you are, within the space. What you're looking at, and with the view system, uh, it's, uh, definitely something that, um, has a lot of value for our clients, partners, inaudible, brokers, and so on. And we have filed for provisional patents on that and basically the reason why we, uh, we used a provisional patent is basically because we wanted to go fast in protecting our idea and also we wanted to make sure that nobody will patent something on top of our ideas that, you know, basically will force us to not promote this technology. So, so far, uh, we have four provisional patents on that. We're working on a fifth one, and basically related, so we were presenting inaudible when there are multiple people on the inaudible, the way we controlling, uh, user, control user loop experiences so far. And, um, about a 3D tour, uh, we have today what we believe one of the most complete 3D marketing websites suite on the market. So, basically, those are websites dedicated to show, to showcase the best way possible 3D tours. Uh, we have more than 20 customizable designs. Uh, act upon the media, like stills, still pictures, video and so on. So, if it's, uh, so we understand that it's highly appreciated by our clients. Because once you have a 3D tour, you need to distribute it, you need to promote it, and we have complete solutions for that. The way, you know, we run inaudible business, we, uh, we're years, inaudible actually, we started developing our own business solution, ERP or CRM, whatever you want to call it, it's a system that helps managing, uh, the inaudible business. And today we're using it to manage our own inaudible business. And what is particular with our solution is that we've deblocked over the years a business intelligence allowing to, uh, treat instant booking. What does it mean? It means that we can, in real time, without any delays, find a inaudible with the next shoot. So, when an agent comes our platform and you want to book a photographer at 2:00, Saturday, the system will find the right photographers for the right services for the right client at 2:00, and the booking is confirmed. There's no other communication. They will be assured that the photographers will be there. So the system calculates the uh, the uh, the, the travel time, calculate the service time, and at the end of the day, give us, you know, the possibility to, uh, to, uh, improve the productivity of the businesses we are acquiring. To give you an example, one of the business we acquired, were doing 3.5 shoots a day, uh, and today they were running at seven shoots a day with this system. So, we feel radically the difference, uh, using our system. Oh, and, I'd like to say, this is a autonomous algorithm. You know, behind that, we don't, we don't use Google, uh, Map, or any other, uh, software. It's, uh, it's our own business intelligence. In terms of on demand services, to recap, so, we are going to be inaudible services for inaudible. It's all pay per job, uh, and, uh, in terms of product fee, we have, uh, around 130 realistic offers, difficult to know, you know, the exact numbers because some offers are working 20 hours, some offers are working 40 hours, so are they full time, part time, whatever. But they're offering the, uh, complete package of, uh, you know, visual conference capturing, 3D planning. On one appointment visit, inaudible are equipped to deliver all the services of inaudible. Floor plan drawing is done offshore. Most of the floor plan drawing is done in Paris. Uh, um, I want to say most, maybe 50 50. 50% is done here in Quebec, using our own software, and, uh, we like to say that we've deblocked some sort of a marketplace where we can engage really rapidly new people to work on our system and to help, you know, with the volume. inaudible is the same, uh, and right now, as we speak, we are dobbling our, uh, photo addition, uh, teams in Paris. Um, the reason is that because, uh, some of the businesses that we have acquired, uh, we currently are paying with, uh, offshore, uh companies three times what it cost us to, uh, inaudible. So, we expect to increase the margins of the, uh, of our, uh, one, some of our biggest acquisitions that we've done recently. Photo additions can be anything from crosstalk. inaudible. No, I'm trying to. It looks like you succeeded to shut it down, and we're terribly sorry about that. It's the first time it's happening. We've been hacked, uh, on that call. Uh, are you hearing me? Yeah, okay. So, first time, first experience. So it's not us, it's not inaudible, so at least you know that. And hopefully those young guy that had a lot of fun. But it's, uh, trying to mute inaudible, if you can. inaudible, can you just slide down? Uh, what? And Marie, also. Yeah. So, sorry for that. We're gonna try to get back to our meeting. Otherwise we're gonna have to terminate that. So, are we good to continue or are we gonna have other people… inaudible, I think you can inaudible. Can you stop, I think, I don't know how it works, Zoom, but can you stop the people getting on the call? Yeah. So, all right, let's close it, uh, Simon, let's close the call. Sorry everyone, and next time we'll use, uh, we'll use something else. Close the call. crosstalk Good bye.",
      "withCtc" : "Maybe we can start that Simon? Uh yeah, I just admit two more. I think we're uh yeah, we we have uh we can start definitely. Perfect. All right, so I will do the introduction. Thank you everyone for being with us today. I'm recognizing a lot of names that we uh that have been following Urban Immersive for uh quarter to quarter. So uh it's a pleasure to uh see you again today. Uh for those who don't know me, my name is Sain Amir. I'm the CEO, co-founder of Urban Immersive. Welcome to our fourth quarter financial result, end of the year, investors Conerenfce call. Bienvenue à notre appel conference and we're finally trimestiling for the fin d'année 2021. For a reason of being efficient and stay efficient and respect our time. We'll be doing this call in English. But we will take both English and French questions at the end. Joining me today, as usual, I have Simon Bedar, our CFO, and I'm just looking at my screen and I see François Huguenge, our new uh executive vice president. During the call, we might make forward-looking statements during future financial performance, operations, products, and events. Although we believe our expectations are reasonable, we cannot guarantee these results. So again, we caution you to read and consider all the risk factors described in our last MDNA. If not, it's gonna be on CDAR pretty soon or in our annual information forum that you can find on CDAR again. So the agenda will be quite uh different slightly different, sorry, uh compared to the last quarter. So what we want to do is uh Simon will uh start by um going to the um last quarter and year end financial highlights. He will talk about some business highlights as well. And then afterwards what uh we thought that you could appreciate today because it's the end of the year, we're starting a new year. Um we thought that, you know, we would take sixteen minutes and do a short uh urban immersive deck presentation so that, you know, we can put everyone on the same foot in regard our in regards of um how the management is seeing urban narrative, how we describe it and what is, you know, our focus and goals uh going forward. So without further ado, I will turn the call to Simon. Simon. Hi, good afternoon everyone. Uh we see we have a lot of uh participants, investors today. So thanks for uh your interest in being uh present on that uh on that call today. Um so what I like to do is um similar to what I've done in the last quarter, just maybe put some uh some color into uh the uh financials that were uh published in the press release this morning. Um I want to apologize. The i we don't have the the FIDER filing yet, but the French version should be available uh within the next hour from uh my friends at Grant Tardan are telling me. Uh sorry they had some some quality uh issues, uh quality control issues this morning. And the English version should follow um within forty eight uh hours. That said, if you have more detailed questions with regards to those financial statements where once they're available in CDAR rally, feel free to contact me uh by phone or email and I will answer uh all questions you have uh with regards to our uh our financials. So um in terms of uh our our uh Q four and two thousand twenty one uh financial resort to start with uh if we talk about revenues uh for the year we end up uh we close the year at slightly above four million in revenues compared to four four point six uh last year. So it's uh eleven percent uh decrease. Uh that decrease is um I would say in is explained in most cases by the uh the decrease in sales of three D uh photography equipment. Uh that was expected uh by the way by by six hundred thousand. If you remember last year, uh well we were pretty happy to have to have acquired uh email solutions uh and benefit from the good uh a solid year of the demand for ki three D cameras uh in the the beginning of the pandemic, but we knew that the won't last uh it won't be sustainable uh over the years. Sorry, there's someone uh Yeah. That was the young food. Okay. We're we're back. Uh yeah, so uh so that was expected. Uh that of course w we'll go back to a a normal level of sales. Uh what is this normal level? Maybe next year we can expect some some time something around two to four hundred thousand dollars, but not what we've seen at the beginning of the pandemic where people were had time to to buy cameras and try it and basically uh uh th there was a a a a boom, but that was a one time thing, so we don't expect this to continue. Um uh uh on the side, uh if we look at the SaaS uh SAS sales, we're uh we're down seven percent uh compared to last year. But uh of course we we you may know that we're uh our company is still today uh uh mostly transactional uh driven, but you know, in terms of the revenues transactional based, meaning that yes, we're progressively moving to s some uh some revenue um recurring revenue streams with the new subscription package that we have that Justin will talk about a bit later. But still today with we're heavily transactional based and and the fact that the market is uh in terms of number of transactions, in terms of number of listings, uh, is down just this year compared to last year, thirty near to thirty percent or twenty-three percent that's in uh Canada with centrists, but in the US it's also in that range, so between twenty-five to thirty percent. And if you remember last year we were down thirty percent. So if you accumulate that, we're basically down sixty percent over two years in terms of uh again uh inventory and number of transactions. Uh i it if you combine this to uh a very quick turnover ratio where properties and and houses are sold most of the time within twenty four to thirty eight hours, uh and they don't eat that much of marketing tools, uh, because they can sell it pretty easily. That's just another factor uh that uh we're facing right now. We we think that all this of course should be temporary. We don't have a crystal ball, well we're gonna be back to a uh normal market. But just to um to uh put things in perspective, uh talking about Centuries. We're uh right now I think we have around thirty five thousand listing um uh on uh on centrist. We used to have one hundred twenty at that time usually so it's uh of course we we're affected by this but the fact that we're seven percent down uh in that type of market uh I think it's it's positive. We uh we're even gaining customers. We're not losing customers at all. We're gaining customers uh with our new subscription package and uh on all different fronts. So uh so uh that's why I it's important to understand uh the the market here when we uh we look at the at our at our numbers. Also uh also what you have what's important this in the last quarter is that you'll see that we have our first quarter of uh s photo service. Uh we have revenues of three hundred seven, three hundred seven thousand of uh photo service. We had uh those acquisitions, if you remember, were on June thirtieth, so we have only one quarter uh this year, but uh but the ones that were acquired in June have maybe uh uh represent approximately one point eight million on an annual basis of revenues. Plus uh of course the ones that you've seen that we acquired in Q one two thousand twenty two in November and December, meaning that today uh I'm not here to to make guidance of what's gonna be our revenues next year, but based on what d those all those companies that we've acquired have done in the last twelve months where as we posted on our website, we uh we are at uh run rate revenues of approximately uh eleven million. And out of this eleven million we have roughly three million in SaaS. Uh as I said, half a million maybe in hardware uh and uh and the seven and a half million remaining is uh is is photoservice. Uh so even Q one, uh twenty twenty two, you can expect that we'll have maybe uh two to four weeks of revenues of those uh new acquisitions that were done in November, December, we we won't have the full effect even in Q one. We will do have in uh in Q two. So um and if we uh and if we talk about Q four, Q four we're uh our revenues were one point one million compared to one point four last year. So we're down uh twenty four uh percent on Q four. But we're seeing that the number of listing have decreased more in Q four this year. That's overall over the year as, my as mentioned we,'re we uh that was in terms of the number of listing inventory that was down thirty percent. So still I think we're doing pretty good uh in this uh very challenging market. Um talking about uh three D tours, uh that's that's a positive thing on our end is that uh we see we experience a lot a lot of growth in the number of three D tours. Uh in fact two two hundred thirty seven percent compared We're talking maybe in dollars around uh roughly around seventy to eighty thousand dollars of new uh of revenues of three D tours this year, and that should continue to grow fast because we uh you may have seen a few uh few updates we provided uh before Christmas with regard to new contracts, including OfferPad, for instance, uh that should scale up and and deploy uh more and more cities over over the months. So we should see uh that trend should continue to uh in terms of number of territories to grow uh fast in the next uh in the next month. That's what we expect. Um talk in terms about of gross margin, uh we're pretty stable compared to last year. Uh for the three month period we were at sixty one percent overall compared to sixty three uh last year. And for the year, uh, we're at sixty five compared to sixty eight. So pretty stable. Of course, it depends on the mix of the revenues, uh, because on the SAS SAS portion our our gross margin is somewhere between eighty two and eighty seven percent. And on the service, photoservice, uh more thirty-five to forty, and on the equipment is a bit lower. So depending depending on the uh the mix, of course, that will affect our gross margin. But basically this should be representative of next year and even probably we could improve that a little bit uh when we're gonna talk about uh some efficiency efficiency gains that we'll we will have uh with the uh synergies and acquisition. uh you know we can see we have a a loss of three point seven uh million for the year but uh uh including three point two million of other expenses. And out of that three point two there's three million or two point nine in fact that comes from uh all the adjustments made with regards to the conversion of the venture, the the convertible the ventures that are all gone as you know uh as of today. So uh this is is not recurring, so uh won't be there uh next year, but uh there was just a one-time uh um uh journal entries this year. But of course that uh uh that explained most of why we uh we have this that loss for uh for the year. Um in terms of uh balance sheet, uh we're uh we're we're still in pretty good shape. In fact uh as you know we we did a a three million private placement in April uh we uh that we use for uh for in in part for our acquisitions. Um we uh at the end of September we had two million of liquidities. I can s I can tell you that as of today we're near a million, so we use that uh an additional million for the acquisitions that were done completed in November and December. Uh so uh we're uh we're pretty we we we're still in good shape. We have enough to operate and execute our our uh our business plan, no problem. there Of course with that million that will serve as a as a as a cushion going forward. So uh we don't expect to use more than that on on acquisition unless we uh we we we we we uh you know we raise additional capital or or or debt or or or some some external funding. Um and other than that, uh as you know, throughout the year we've uh we've eliminated our convertible debuters. That was uh we reduce our debt in fact by four point seven million uh throughout the year including four point five uh just for the convertible the ventures. Uh so uh so basically again I think our balance sheet is in good shape. And uh yeah, that's pretty much the point I wanted to cover. Um there's in DM DNA and financial you'll have some information by segment uh where we now track three different segments. Uh one is the software, uh one is the uh photography equipment and one is the service. So uh so again uh hopefully I I'll be able to to to post it on CDR pretty soon so you can come back to me if you have further questions. And on that, uh I think I I'll turn the mic to you, Gislay, if you uh if you want to maybe give a a a bus a quick a business update through the presentation. Absolutely, uh Simon, but just before we jump to the next point on the agenda, uh is there anyone who would like to ask specific questions about financial that uh Simon just covered? Or uh you still think about your questions and you're gonna keep it for the end. It's like you want, you know, we can take a couple of minutes just to go over and uh clear the uh the financial side of it if you want. Otherwise, you know, we're just gonna keeping continuing. So we're seeing any question right now I will say you raise your hand but you're just everybody is kind of uh closing his camera so I'm not seeing every anyone. I just have one uh slice. Um uh Simon you mentioned that uh you currently have about a million in cash and you're not uh using uh any more cash for acquisitions, so um how should we think about the acquisition strategy going forward? Um since you know the there there's been a decline in the stock price, so um maybe it's not as attractive uh uh anymore um to pay to pay in shares or to raise uh raising more more cash uh by issuing new shares. So how do you think about that? Uh yeah but I mean we're not uh as you've seen we've closed eight acquisition uh or six acquisition just in December. So right now we're on the uh dig integration phase. It's going very well. Uh just we'll cover that in a in a sec. Uh so we're we're not we're not a week or two to basically uh uh uh uh announce a new uh acquisition. So and we s we do have a lot of uh things on our plate really. So we're pretty optimistic about what's coming and and of course hopefully the uh uh the the the market will also be uh more on the red than on the green. So basically all to say is that we uh by the time we uh we're back on track with acquisition we we think and we hope that uh our our start price would be at the higher levels. Yeah, perfect, thank you. And if it's not, then we can also, you know, kind of uh just delay some of the deals or or look for uh any uh any other kind of structure uh to close those deals. Any other question or we move forward to uh just open your mic if you want to ask a question to uh Simon and uh just ask your question. You're more than welcome. And like I said, you know, we're gonna keep answering questions uh at the end. So I promise, all right, I'm gonna go into a deck. It's very seldom that we're doing that on the conference call, investor conference call. I think it might be the first time if I do uh remember, but uh I promise it will be short. I'll try to do it in ten minutes. Hopefully I will not lose everyone. But uh ten minutes to fifteen just covering fifteen, twenty slides. And the reason why we wanted to do it is that we were getting a lot of calls, and I uh and uh through those calls we are realizing that um we often have to um uh kind of realign the storytelling with some investors who think we're uh some investors think we are a metaverse business, some investors think that we're just a photography business and so on and so forth. So I think that uh the goal of this uh this deck is uh is kind of uh redefining for uh for everyone, you know, I see defining for everyone, you know, on the same page uh what is is urban immersive and where we're going. So I'm gonna share my screen in a second. Hopefully, you're all gonna see it, except if you're uh on your cell phone and what's um on a smaller device, you might have some problems seeing it. So I'm gonna comment those slides. here Just gonna click on the part of presentation. So like Simon said, this is um the way we describe urban immersive on on uh the TSX on our website. Um we're basically a technological business, uh technology business that provides services in the market of real estate society. Put it in other words, I like to say that we're a tech-powered real estate society business. That's another way to present Urban Immersive. Run rate of $11 million, and today, you know, including the photographers who are on the repayroll, um paper job and on their payroll, we're uh turning around one hundred and fifteen employees. If you can do the head office with uh the developers and uh the management and everything, we're probably f turning around around thirty employees. We're based in Montreal. Uh and of course we're listening on C S adventure. So this is I I don't want go into detail, but I just want to remind people that we're not a startup. I mean we've been in this business for uh more than ten years and the first thing that my brother and I did uh ten years ago was to design this spaceship kind of prototype of mild lens camera, but it was a real prototype by the way. And in two thousand nine we tried to um raise money to commercialize business. And uh this is why in twenty twelve we kind of jumped on the TSX vureent at that time in here in Canada and Quebec's particularly we were having access to a a tax kind of advantage for an investor called RIA so to uh to raise money. But uh this camera never s the light, so we kind of uh um create all the software uh surrounding CD Tour. But you know, we're not newcomers. We've we've been trying a lot of things in the real estate supply for business uh from developing cameras software, business solutions, so on and so forth. So we know you know the business pretty well. And some of the engineers working with me to develop those software, I've been working with them for more than twenty five years. So this is our set. This is not something you're gonna find on the market, but you know when we sit down and try to evaluate what is the size of our market and our market is real estate or core market. Of course at the end of the day we'll talk about addressable markets, but our core market is real estate photography. For the purpose of marketing. So basically, you know, to sell a house. So when we consider that activity for residential, commercial and rentals, we are estimating that this is a an a niche market of four billion dollars just in the uh in north America. Potentially in our estimation, something about seven to eight billion dollar world wild. Here in North America, we're estimating about thirty million shoots a year. Shoot for us as a photographer, taking a star and do it, shoot a house and bring back twenty five, thirty five uh images with all the uh media that comes with that. And roughly that's provide generates a billion images per year. So that's our this is our market. Like Simon said, this is a transactional market. I mean, our business is linked to the housing inventory. So if the housing inventory ramp up, we're gonna ramp up. If it's going down because our business model, as we're gonna see in this slide, is mostly nine percent transactional based, we're gonna follow the trend. And unfortunately right now the trend is uh historic co uh actually it's historic. Uh the uh most of the MLS we talk with they never saw such a low inventory of house for sales. Uh you know, I'm not sure I like those numbers the way I'm presenting it today, but those are real. I mean the market is down twenty three percent, urban urban receipt is down eleven percent year over year. And our new acquisition or are just coming into, you know, our pipeline of revenue uh in the last quarter. So if you take just the SaaS, like Simon said, minus seven percent. Overall, we feel we're winning clients. Uh we don't feel that we're losing clients, but we we what we're saying is that our photographers, our clients are doing less business overall. So this is why I mean, you know, it's kind of um uh of a a bad place to be right now. But you know, I'm a positive person and um I don't think it's gonna get worse. Uh and uh we're hearing that you know the interest rate should increase, so that will kind of uh uh hopefully uh slow down a little bit, you know, the um uh some of the interest of uh buyers uh uh or people selling a house. In any cases I think we kind of the uh we are at the bottom of the of the barrier right now. So I think it's that the situation will just come go start and ramping up again. And of course like uh Simon said, you know, we potentially sixty percent uh down compared to what sh numbers should usually be in terms of uh listings in terms of house for sales. So our vendor ship should follow the trends and and potentially just, you know, uh beat the transaction because we believe right now we're beating, you know, we're kind of uh succeeding in that very, very difficult market. I can tell you what's certainly I'm talking to a lot of uh entrepreneurs in the real estate uh space, and they're all in the same position right now. All right, so the photoship business in itself, it's a it's a business that is transforming a lot and it's definitely shifting to a technology driven, high volume business. So basically you have to do a lot of transactions per day because it's a highly competitive landscape and you need to bring a lot of value in terms of technology. So basically we kind of you know spread all the parts that you need to succeed in photography business, like we need to have online booking system, you need to have the capture hardware, not just a camera, but then you might need a three D camera, you might need a a drone, so you need to have those specialized hardware. You need to uh post is it your images to increase you know the the the the the white balance to put a blue sky on uh on the external uh facade uh images so you need to have this service you need to create youtube video slideshows because YouTube is one of the the most popular search engine in real estate. Of course, you need to provide 3D tours, it's a must-have today. And for plan is kind of, I will say basically more important than the three D tours right now. on the market There's a lot of interest, even in some states, like here in Canada, fore plants are mandatory. Uh this is a common product. It's uh you know, you definitely need to provide websites, we call it property website. So it's a website dedicated to showcase one house for sale. You need a system to deliver one and five images, high quality images. You know images cannot be just transferred by email. So you need to have some sort of a solid system to transfer your image and you need a very performant payment system to get paid. When you look at all those things that you need to run a photography business today. Urban Earth is the only company offering and owning every part of uh the uh the every every portion, every technology required to the business uh right now. And that's giving us uh a lot of advantages over over our competition. I will start from the bottom. Of course, the after sales support is easier for Ben Russia to do because we're providing each part. We're not relying to third party for three D tours, for floor plans, for photo editions, everything is done internally. So of course we have a pretty difficult to be turnaround every time. We can deliver uh faster than our competitors because they're fewer uh parties involved. We can we have more flexibilities in our packages we can offer and deal with our our clients. We keep our margins pretty high for the value we bring and you know, we we like to tell the market that we uh we are one of the most competitive uh business right now in terms of pricing. So being a one stop shop is definitely bringing a lot of value to our clients and it's positioning or Ben Immersive for winning many deals, many contracts with real estate agents and offers. The business model, when you look at each of the parts, there's some portion of those um those um required um elements that you need to run a uh a photography business that are not technology, like you know, taking a picture, you need to have a human doing that, you need to have a photographer. Uh photo editing an images, you know, even if AI is super well advanced and you know a lot of people tell that they are photo edit editing images with computers, you still have some humans. The humans will do a better job. And the floor plans, you need a dr somebody draw to draw floor plans with and put furniture write the rooms name and stuff like that. Those services we are offering it to our clients. So we call them service on demand and it is transactional based. So each time somebody wants to have a photographer on site, uh the the the client pay and send a photographer, send things for photo edition and foreclans. And the rest is mostly technology, so and we're still offering it every part, even if there's no uh line with the booking system we we are offering it. And it's still transactional uh most uh of uh for most of the parts. So we're charging, for example, five dollars to render a a site should be or four dollars to render a 3D tours, uh, fifteen dollars to create a property website, and uh three dollars to transfer the image. So you need to think about this part here as a drop box drop box kind of uh platform to transfer the high quality majors. We added this year a new service that Simon briefly talked during the financial highlights, what we call the Prime Subscription. So the prime subscription is basically for $30 a month. Agents can subscribe to that plan. And each time they order one of our photographers, we're gonna bundle all the technologies uh we can offer. to them So this is a very popular um subscription right now or it's uh and we will talk a little bit uh later in the deck uh about it. Simon briefly talked about the distribution revenues, so three million in SaaS, eight million dollars in uh services. I just want to add uh for the SaaS we're still uh serving around seventeen hundred uh real estate topopers. So this number here is our independent photographers using our technologies to serve their agents, their clients. They're generating around two hundred six thousand probability websites per year. In terms of services, so we're talking about our photographers, we're serving around twelve thousand real estate agents and doing around fifty thousand shoots a year, pull shoots a year. So basically, this is including all our acquisitions that we've done uh during 2021. When we talk about technology and you saw it from the uh history, uh the timelines of uh Urban Immersive, you know, we started with the three sixty camera design we're still passionate passionate, hot highly passionate about three D technology. We'll always kind of keep that uh in our products and and really kind of uh hope that someday you know three D tours will will get back on the market. And this is the this and what COVID nineteen has created, generated a demand for three tours, this is our core technology. And we believe that we have right now one of the most complete 3D tour solutions on the market. If you look at uh the all the features we are offering, uh few companies can um can uh uh state that they have have all this in their three solution. So of course we're each time we're doing a three D tour, we're providing a dollhouse. This is the way you know we commonly uh call all this kind of uh three D tours and room segmentations. We can measure uh um on the floor and and with tape. Uh we're having our own built-in four-plan drawing software built in in the 3D tour itself. So even our clients can play with it and can change the uh the four plans if they want. So there's it if we're not using AutoCAD, we're not using a third-party software to create our fall plans. We use uh the AI powered um the classification system uh that we acquired from Tourbus in 2018 to uh automatically put a tag in rooms to say this is a fitness room, a kitchen, so on so forth. We have those tags also that you can put some graphic and links, some crawling that hotspot, 3D hotspot. This is pretty unique to Urban Immersive. So we are showing an interactive map of people within the room. This is not picture of people actually, it's a real video. So you can see, you know, people in their um in the live stream video on the map. And of course we have the avatars, so the three D social spaces where you can visit with friends and interact with them. So whether you can interact uh by chatting or you can interact with video conferencing. The next slide is uh something pretty special for us because you know we we are running a photography business and we are offering phot uh photography services and we want to be highly efficient and the only way you can achieve um profitability and keep your margins by going fast. You need to do a shoot super fast. Being two hours in the house, you know, it's uh it's it's too long. So we want our photographers to do six to seven shoots per per day. And in order to do that, we developed our own capture app that is three times faster than anything else that we've seen on the market to to uh scan a house. It works on iPhone, iPad, it used advanced computer vision alignment system to uh create those maps when you shoot. It's fully integrated within our workflow, so it's definitely uh improving uh the productivity of our people. And it also we also have some features that enable photographers to add uh additional uh information on the map uh for uh adding value um in post production. We recently launched this uh this uh uh what we call the automated uh building and sites and analytics report. So for every tour we uh providing with our prime subscription, people will receive a detailed report about the property. So they will know how many sink showers the uh the the building has, how many doors, uh outside doors, inside doors, and so on and so forth. So it's uh highly detailed and uh really appreciated with some of our clients, like OfferPad, for instance, that are refurnishing uh many of the homes they're they're uh buying to resell them. Um this is unique to urban immersive. We call it UI Meet 3D. So basically it's the avatar that you you know you can see people visiting the home with you in the 3D space, and we just open their video camera so it becomes some sort of a three D video conference. I will tell you that uh we're presenting UI meet three D to many um uh industry leaders and uh it's making a lot of noise right now and we're expecting to have some um significant uh uh partnership to announce soon. Uh many of the people in within the industry and as you see I'm not using that word today, but we've been told and people are telling us that it might be the version one point zero after all of metaverse. You know, being able to be all together uh within an environment visually interacting, uh where you are with within the space, what you're looking at and with the video system. Uh it's um definitely something that um has a lot of value for our clients, partners, MLSs, brokers, and so on. And we have filed four provisional patents on that. And basically the reason why we uh we use a provisional patent is basically because we wanted to go fast in protecting our ideas and also we want to make sure that nobody will patent something on top of our ideas that you know basically will um for force us to not uh you know promote this technology. So so far uh we have four provisional patterns on that. We're working on the fifth one. It's basically related to the way we're presenting avatars when there are multiple people on the same axis, the way we are controlling uh user group control user group experience and so on and so forth. And um about the 3D tour, uh we have today what we believe one of the most complete 3D marketing website suite on the market. So basically it's those are websites dedicated to show to showcase the the best way possible 3D tours. We have more than 20 customizable designs. Uh we accept other media like still pictures, video and and so on. So it's um it's it's a solution that is highly um appreciated by our clients because once you have 3D tours, you need to distribute it, you need to promote it, and we have a complete solution to that. The way you know we run a fast business, uh we uh over the years at November 2013, actually, we started developing our own business solution, ERP or CRM, whatever you want to call it. It's a system that helps managing a photography business. And today we're using it to manage our own today business. And what is particular with our solution is that we've developed over the years a business intelligence allowing to create instant booking. Uh what does it mean? It means that we can in real time, without any delays, find the closest photographers for the next shoot. So when an agent comes our platform and they want to book a photographers at two o'clock Saturday, the system will find the right photographers for the right services for the right client at two o'clock, and the booking is confirmed. There's no other communication. They will be sure that the photographers will be there. So the system calculate the uh the uh the the travel time, calculate the service time. And at the end of the day it gave us, you know, uh the possibility to uh to uh improve the productivity of the businesses we are acquiring. To give you an example, one the business we acquired, they were doing three point five shoots a day, uh and today they're running at seven shoots a day with this system. So we see rapidly the difference uh using our system. Oh and I like to say this is an autonomous algorithm. You know behind that we don't we don't use Google uh map or any other uh software. It's our own business intelligence. In terms of on-demand services, it's a recap. So we are offering to e scanning and photography services, portland drawing, image announcements. It's all paper jobs. And in terms of photography, we have uh w a around one hundred thirty real estate photographers. Uh it's difficult to know, you know, the exact numbers because some photographers are working twenty hours, some photographers are working forty hours or the full time, part-time, whatsoever, but they offering the uh complete package of uh you know uh visual content capturing 3d scanning uh on one appointment basically our photographers are um um are are equipped to deliver all the services of urban immersive. Forpland drying is done offshore. Most of the parking drying is done in Paris, uh was the most, maybe fibefty 50 fi fty50, 50% is done here in Quebec using our own software. And we like to say that we've developed uh some sort of a marketplace so we can um uh engage uh really rapidly new people to work on our system and to help you know with the volume. Photo edition is the same uh and right now as with as we speak we are doubling our uh photo edition uh team in Paris. Um the reason is that because uh some of the businesses that we have acquired uh recently are paying with uh offshore uh companies three times what it costs us to uh post uh edit images. So we expect to increase the margins of uh uh of uh our uh one some of our biggest acquisitions that we've done with sampling. There, um my man uh is there a we can just No, I'm trying to. It looks like uh you succeeded to uh shut it down and we're terribly sorry about that. It's the first time it's happening. We've been hacked uh on that call. Uh are you hearing me? Yeah, okay. So first time, perfect experience. So it's not us, it's not played by Rebel Mercy. Hopefully, you know that. And hopefully those uh young guys that uh have a lot of fun. But it's uh try to to mute Samuel Mantes, uh Simon, if you can. I see Samuel Mantes. Can you just sit down? Uh what? And uh Marie also. Yeah. So we're sorry for that. We're gonna try to uh get back to our meeting, otherwise we're gonna have to terminate that. So are we good to continue or are we g'reonna have other people. Can you stop ac i I think I don't know how it we're zoomed assignment, but can you stop uh people getting on the call? Yeah. Well alright, let's close it uh Simon. Let's close the call. Okay. Sorry everyone. And with next time we'll use Shut a fuck up, Kiseline. Shut a fuck up. We'll use something else. Close that call. Goodbye."

      "baseline" : "Hello, thank you for standing by and welcome to Imperial Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Hughes, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll start by introducing uh you to the management team we have in attendance. Uh Brad Corson, Chairman, President and CEO, Dan Lyons, Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration, Simon Younger, Senior Vice President of the Upstream, Sherry Evers, Vice President of Commercial and Corporate Development, and John Wetmore, Vice President of the Downstream. So I'll quickly go over the cautionary statement. Today's comments include reference to non-GAP financial measures, the definitions and reconciliations of these measures can be found in attachment six of our most recent press release and are available on our website with the link to this conference call. And any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance, and actual future financial performance and operating results can differ materially depending on a number of factors and assumptions. Forward-looking information and the risk factors and assumptions are described in further detail in our fourth quarter earnings press release that we issued this morning, as well as our most recent Form 10K. And all of these documents are available on CEDAR, Edgar, and on our website. So I'd ask you to please refer to those. So just before I turn it over to Brad for his opening remarks, once he's done and and he and Dan go over our financial and operating performance for the quarter, we will be moving to the Q and A session as usual. So with that I'll turn it over to Brad. Good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope each of you are doing well and are in good health to start the new year. As we bring 2021 to a close, well at least from a reporting point of view, I would like to repeat something I said on the third quarter call. Wow, what a difference a year makes. I'm very pleased to report that we finished the year strong with another quarter of solid operating performance and strong financial results. In twenty twenty, we focused heavily on ensuring Imperial was well positioned to take advantage of the market recovery through ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure, improving our reliability, and progressing high return brownfield projects. And you can now see the benefits of those efforts in our twenty twenty one results, as we continued to make the most of the improving and attractive business environment. This performance was reflected in all business lines, although we did see some pretty challenging weather to close out the year. And as it has all year, this performance allowed us to return a material amount of cash to shareholders in the quarter. And in fact, to accelerate the pace of these returns, resulting in around $3 billion for the full year, the highest level in the company's history. Throughout 2021, we continued to manage the ongoing challenges due to COVID-19. Our focus on maintaining the health and safety of our workforce was key, not only in minimizing disruptions to our operations, but also and most importantly in ensuring the well being of our people. From a business perspective, we saw continued demand recovery throughout the year and significant improvement in commodity prices, both of which are reflected in our results. Over the next few minutes, Dan and I will detail the results of what was a very strong quarter. So now let's turn more specifically to the fourth quarter results. Earnings for the fourth quarter were eight hundred and thirteen million dollars, and our cash from operating activities was over one point six billion dollars, both somewhat lower versus the third quarter. Earnings were negatively impacted by approximately one hundred sixty million dollars in one time non cash events. And cash flow excluding working capital effects was up more than $100 million, reflecting our strong operating performance and the strong commodity fundamentals in the quarter. Crude prices continue to strengthen through the quarter while both downstream and chemical margins remained strong. Our upstream continued to perform very well, delivering its highest annual And our downstream performed well also. We saw utilization of ninety-seven percent for the quarter and higher product sales as demand continued to recover. Our chemical business closed out the year with another strong quarter and delivered the highest full year earnings in over 30 years. As expected, polyethylene margins did soften somewhat in the quarter, but remained strong and supported the best ever full year earnings for this business. So in total, our strong cash flow generation in a period of strong commodity prices was underpinned by continued strong operational performance. We were able to take advantage of attractive markets for crude, refined products and chemicals. And all of this contributes to a very strong cash position which continues to allow us to deliver on our priority of returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter we, returned $950 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and accelerated share buybacks. For the year, we generated about $5.5 billion doll ofars cash from operating activities and around four point five billion dollars of free cash flow. And we put this cash to good use. Early in the year we announced the largest quarterly dividend in the company's history and reinstituted our share buyback program, which we suspended in 2020 due to the business environment brought on by the pandemic. And in the fourth quarter, we announced an acceleration of the renewed NCIB. All of this resulted in the return of nearly three billion dollars of cash to our shareholders in the year. 2021 marks the twenty-seventh consecutive year of dividend increases. And you would have seen us continue this trend with the announcement this morning of another significant dividend increase of seven cents per share, which is around twenty six percent, our largest dividend increase in history. This equates to a fifty five percent increase since the beginning of 2021 and represents an increase of almost 80% since the beginning of 2019. Going forward, following yesterday's completion of our accelerated NCIB and today's announcement of a sizable dividend increase, we remain committed to returning surplus cash to shareholders and are actively evaluating our next steps in this area, including a potential substantial issuer bid. We are unwavering in our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and delivering further shareholder value and returns. I'll now turn it over to Dan to go through our financial performance for the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brad. Getting into the financial results for the full year, we recorded net income of almost two and a half billion dollars, an increase of around three point two billion dollars, excluding the one-time one point two billion dollar non-cash impairment charge related to our unconventional business that we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of twenty twenty one, our net income was eight hundred and thirteen million dollars. Excluding identified items, net income increased almost eight hundred million dollars from the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by stronger realizations in the upstream and improved margins in the downstream and chemicals. Now, if we look sequentially, our fourth quarter income of $813 million is down, about $95 million from the third quarter of this year. As Brad noted, the fourth quarter results include a number of unrelated one-time, non-CAS charges totaling about $160 million. Looking at each business line, the upstream recorded net income of $545 million up $20 million from our third quarter net income of five hundred and twenty four million dollars as a result of higher realizations and volumes, partly offset by higher operating expenses, driven in part by mine progress spend at curl and higher energy costs. Upstream results included a number of one time charges of about eighty five million dollars. The downstream recorded net income of two hundred and fifty million dollars down $43 million from net income of $293 million in the third quarter. Downstream results included a number of one-time charges totaling around $75 million. Chemicals continue to demonstrate strong performance in the fourth quarter with net income of sixty-four million dollars, down about sixty million dollars from the third quarter of this year as polyethylene prices moderated from the extremely extremely strong levels seen in the third quarter. Moving on to cash flow, in the fourth quarter, we generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operating activities, imp anrovement of about $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020. Our free cash flow for the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Looking at the full year, our strong results in capital discipline deliver free cash flow of almost four and a half billion dollars. As we start 2022, strong commodity prices, along with our continued cost and capital discipline, position us well to generate very substantial free cash flow going forward. Moving on to CapEx, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $441 million, up from $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Full year capital expenditures were in line with revised guidance at just over $1.1 billion. Capital spending in 2021 was focused on progressing key projects such as curlit tailings infrastructure and the Sarnia products pipeline. We also continue to invest in improving volumes through projects like the Solvent Assisted Laser Project at our Makesis Cold Lake plant and improving the efficiency and cost structure of our operations by continuing to invest in projects like our autonomous haul truck fleet and related infrastructure, as well as installing our first boiler flue gas heat recovery unit at Curl. In December, we announced our 2022 capital guidance at $1.4 billion, reflecting our strong ongoing capital discipline. In the upstream at Curl, capital spending includes the ramp up of the Curl Inpit Tailings Project, ongoing investment in our autonomous truck fleet, and installing additional boiler flue gas heat recovery units. At Cold Lake, we will work on developing phase one of our Grand Rapids project, continue to progress solvent assisted laser, as well as infill drilling and well work. And the downstream spending includes the completion and commissioning of the Sarnia products pipeline and spending on the Stratona Renewable Diesel Project. We will have an opportunity to discuss these plans in more detail at our investor day. Shifting to shareholder distributions. As I mentioned earlier, we generated about four and a half billion dollars of free cash flow in twenty twenty one. This performance supported record returns of almost three billion dollars of cash to shareholders, including returns of about nine hundred and fifty million dollars in the fourth quarter alone. We repurchased seventeen and a half million shares for seven hundred and sixty-one million dollars in the quarter under an accelerated program, bringing our full year buyback to fifty six million shares for over two point two billion dollars. We pay dividends of one hundred eighty eight million in the fourth quarter and a total of over $700 million for the full year. Despite these record distributions, we ended the year with about two point two billion dollars of cash on hand. Consistent with our previous announcement, we continued our accelerated NCIB purchases in January 2022 and completed this program on January thirty first. We also declared an increased dividend of thirty-four cents per share payable on April one. Furthermore, as Brad mentioned, in light of our current cash balance and the strong business outlook, we are actively evaluating options for additional shareholder returns, including a potential substantial issuer bid. Now I'll turn it back to Brad to discuss our operational performance. Thanks, Dan. As we switch our focused operations, I would sum up the fourth quarter as being another strong quarter operationally across all business lines. In the upstream, we averaged four hundred and forty five thousand oil equivalent barrels per day, which is an increase of ten thousand barrels per day versus the third quarter, but is down fifteen thousand barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. This decrease year on year was due mainly to an early start to winter. In fact, Alberta saw several weeks of extreme Arctic temperatures in the last half of December and early January, which as you know presents some operational challenges, particularly in our mining operations. At our Investor Day in late twenty twenty, we communicated our intent to focus the upstream organization's efforts on maximizing the performance of our existing asset base. And given how the assets performed in twenty twenty one, I would say we are on that strategy and achieving it and it's also paying off for us. In fact, our full year twenty twenty-one production was four hundred and twenty-eight thousand oil equivalent barrels per day, which is the highest in over thirty years and exceeded our guidance for the year. I would also note the current market environment and the strong commodity prices we are seeing. While in the fourth quarter there were a number of factors which drove the WTI WCS spreads wider, such as the phase start up of line three and other smaller disruptions, we are now seeing narrower spreads and are well positioned to continue to benefit from this. So now let's move on and talk about curl. Production at curl in the fourth quarter averaged two hundred and seventy thousand barrels per day gross, which was down four thousand barrels per day versus the third quarter, and fourteen thousand barrels per day lower than the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. As I mentioned, Western Canada saw an early start to winter, feeling the effects of a deep freeze that started late in the fourth quarter and extended into the new year. And as we have talked about in the past, extended periods of extreme cold weather can be challenging for our operations, and particularly mining. The result of these weather challenges was lower than expected production in the fourth quarter at Curl, with an estimated impact of around thirteen thousand barrels per day in the quarter, or just over three thousand barrels per day on a full-year basis. The impacts of the extreme cold weather continued to linger into January, but I'm pleased to say that as of now our operations have essentially returned to normal. I would also like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous dedication of our workforce, whose efforts to safely maintain our operations in these extreme conditions and mitigate the production impacts are a huge credit to the organization. Despite the weather impacts, total full year production for curl was two hundred and sixty three thousand barrels per day, the highest in the asset's history. This compares to two hundred and twenty-two thousand barrels per day in twenty twenty, an increase of forty-one thousand barrels per day for the year. And its curl continues to deliver on its production and reliability commitments, including the elimination of the second annual turnaround, a full year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we continue to be excited about Curl's potential as we make progress on our accelerated journey to two hundred and eighty thousand barrels per day. And despite the slower start to the year, we reiterate our 2022 guidance of 265 to 270,000 barrels per day, reflecting the next step in production growth at the site. I would also note that this 2022 guidance reflects one major planned turnaround expected to be executed in the second quarter of the year. I'd like to wrap up our discussion about curl with some comments about unit costs, another positive reflection of the asset's performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, continued pressure from higher energy prices and the strength of the Canadian dollar presented some challenges in meeting our unit cash cost target of US twenty dollars per barrel. In 2021, higher energy costs and the strength of the Canadian dollar represented approximately an incremental two dollars and fifty cents per barrel relative to twenty twenty. However, if we normalize for energy costs in Forex, both items outside our control, our unit cost would have achieved a reduction of almost one dollar per barrel from 2020 and been below the target of US twenty dollars per barrel. Close management of unit costs continues to be core to our approach to maximizing profitability at Curl, and we remain focused on achieving further unit cost reductions as we go forward. So now let's talk about Cold Lake. Cold Lake has been a really positive story throughout 2021. Production for the quarter averaged 142,000 barrels per day, which was up 7,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter, and 6,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. This strong performance reflects the benefits of our continued focus on production optimization and reliability. And while Cold Lake experienced the same stream same extreme cold temperatures in December, it did not have a material impact given the nature of this operation. For the year, production averaged one hundred forty thousand barrels per day, exceeding our updated guidance of one hundred and thirty five thousand barrels per day. Our full year production at Cold Lake was driven by significant improvement to the base performance, highlighting the effectiveness of our strategy to focus on reliability and optimization. We also saw the benefits from recent drilling investments in our operations, which contributed almost two thousand barrels per day of production for the year. We are looking forward to continuing to benefit from these improvements in the coming year. And for 2022, we have issued guidance of 135,000 to 140,000 barrels per day for Cold Lake, which includes a typical plant turnaround in the second quarter. Now at Sincrude, Imperial's share of production for the quarter averaged 79,000 barrels per day, which was up slightly from seventy-eight thousand barrels per day in the third third quarter, but down eight thousand barrels per day from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. Unplanned downtime coupled with extreme cold weather presented challenges for these operations in December, as detailed in the statement issued by the operator Suncor earlier in January. We estimate the impact to be close to five thousand barrels per day our share in the quarter. Imperial share of full year production averaged seventy one thousand barrels per day, an increase of two thousand barrels per day versus 202.0 As the ownership continues its focus on improving asset reliability, we reiterate our guidance for 2022 of 75 to 80,000 barrels per day. This guidance reflects the impacts of planned maintenance in the second quarter and a major coker turnaround in the third quarter. 2021 also marked a change in the operating structure at Syncrude and we remain confident that this change will better support the continued focus on improved reliability and cost performance for this asset. Moving to the downstream, we refined an average of four hundred and sixteen thousand barrels per day in the fourth quarter, which was up twelve thousand barrels a day versus the third quarter of twenty twenty one, and up fifty-seven thousand barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting the strong operating performance and the continuation of demand recovery we have seen throughout 2021. The fourth quarter throughput equates to a utilization of 97%, which is the highest fourth quarter utilization in over thirty years. This represents a 3% increase over the third quarter, bringing our full year utilization to eighty nine percent, which is right on the guidance we provided for twenty twenty one. And for the year, throughput was three hundred and seventy nine thousand barrels per day, up thirty nine thousand barrels per day versus twenty twenty. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, we have a fairly light turnaround year planned, supporting our increased guidance for twenty twenty two of ninety-two to ninety-four percent utilization. Looking at cash operating costs, our downstream business continues to do an exceptional job in managing its operating costs. Four-year cash operating costs were down $70 million compared to 2020, and down even more when normalizing for the rising energy prices we saw in 2021. This decrease is especially notable because over the same period our refining throughput increased by 39,000 barrels per day and our petroleum product sales grew by 35,000 barrels per day. So we are refining more barrels and selling more product, and we're doing it at a lower absolute cost. And again, this was a year of significant turnaround activity and higher energy costs. Petroleum product sales in the fourth quarter were 496,000 barrels per day, up 11,000 barrels per day from the third quarter on continued strong demands and up eighty thousand barrels per day from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty, reflecting significant recovery from the pandemic related softness of twenty twenty. We continue to see industry demand trends pretty consistent with what we saw through twenty twenty one. With gasoline and diesel demands hovering around 90 to 95 percent of historical levels, and jet continuing to improve, averaging around 70 to 75 percent. However, as mentioned, JET continues to be somewhat volatile as we experience subsequent waves of COVID nineteen and the associated restrictions related to travel. Also of note is that our jet sales volumes continue to track about 10% ahead of industry, predominantly related to competitive gains we were able to capture in 2021, increasing our overall market share. And with respect to downstream margins, unlike crude prices, our fourth quarter crack spreads continue to hover around the middle of the five year band, which reflects fairly steady improvement over early twenty twenty at the onset of the pandemic. And despite ongoing demand volatility, our continued focus on reliable and efficient operations ensures we are capturing as much value as possible in the current downstream pricing environment. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, the outlook is positive as we continue to see improvements in the market environment, driving further strengthening of our downstream business, which supports our continued journey back to typical earnings and cash flows for this business segment. And I'll wrap up our operating results with chemicals twenty  tw2enty one0.21 was an incredible year for this key part of our business, and I just can't say enough about how pleased I am with the performance it delivered, making the most of capturing a very favorable market environment. The fourth quarter was another solid quarter. Earnings in the fourth quarter were sixty-four million dollars, supported by continued strong production, reliability, and margins. Fourth quarter earnings were down fifty-seven million versus a third quarter, which I will will remind you was the highest quarterly earnings in over thirty years. This reduction was driven largely by expected softening of polyethylene margins. And while margins did soften somewhat in the quarter, they still remain quite strong, and that sets the chemical business up well for a strong twenty twenty two. Full year chemical earnings were three hundred sixty one million dollars, seventy four million higher than the previous full year record of two hundred eighty seven million dollars set in twenty fifteen. An outstanding year for our chemical business, which continues to be a differentiator for us. The integrated nature of our business supports a long history of profitability, even in a year like twenty twenty. And we expect this to continue even as we see polyethylene prices normalizing somewhat. And just before wrapping up, I wanted to highlight a couple of other important items of note. First, we announced our plans to market our interest in XTO Energy Canada a few weeks ago, which of as you will recall is our unconventional business. We have been quite open recently about where this business fits into our longer-term upstream strategy, and our decision to market the assets is fully consistent with this. To be clear though, no decision has been made to sell these assets, but in our view we felt it was appropriate to test the market in the event there is an opportunity to generate increased value through a potential sales transaction. I also wanted to highlight the announcements we made recently on Imperial's plans for further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions intensity over the next decade to help support Canada's net zero goals. Imperial has set a twenty thirty goal to reduce scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our operated oil sands facilities by thirty percent compared with twenty sixteen levels. This target builds on our previous twenty twenty three commitment, which we are well on track to deliver. I'm quite proud of the progress we made to date in reducing the intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions at our operated oil sands assets. And our recent announcement is another step in our journey to net zero at our operated oil sands assets by twenty fifty. So in closing, another strong quarter, which brings to a close a year of very strong results, both operationally and financially. As you have heard me say before, the decisions we have made and the work the organization has done over the past several quarters is allowing us to take maximum advantage of the prevailing market conditions. And this performance supports our ongoing commitment to drive increased shareholder value and our continued commitment to shareholder returns. As you heard Dan and I mentioned, in twenty twenty one we returned nearly three billion dollars to our shareholders via our reliable and growing dividend and share buybacks. And we are also excited to reinforce our commitments to sustainability, not only with our recent announced greenhouse gas intensity reduction target, but with our participation in the Pathways Initiative, an unprecedented industry alliance. Our long term focus on reducing our environmental footprint through investments in things like solvent technologies and carbon capture and storage underpin our confidence in meeting these goals. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, we continue to see support for commodity prices and fully expect to deliver another year of strong operational performance, underpinning our ability to take utmost advantage of the current market conditions. We will continue our focus on reduced emissions and sustainability, including our plans for renewable diesel at our Strathcona refinery. We will remain disciplined with respect to spending levels, both operating and capital. And we will also continue to return cash in excess of these needs to our shareholders. And finally, I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support. I hope you're as excited about twenty twenty two as we are. Thank you and back to you Dave. Okay, we're gonna move to the QA now. We did have a couple of uh questions pre-submitted, which we'll get to first, and then we'll go to the live QA line. So the two questions came from Phil Skullnick at 8 Capital. The first one, what are you in ExxonMobil looking for in order to make a decision on marketing the XTO assets? Would you consider selling it in pieces? Yeah, thanks for that question, Phil. Um in January our intention to market those assets jointly with with ExxonMobil. Uh and in fact we've we've progressed those activities now, have the data room open. There there is a lot of interest. And you know, our our decision around marketing was really driven by the strategic work we have done over the last couple of years where we have prioritized our focus on certain assets and our portfolio and uh and and really prioritized our capital as well. And and through that work we we have concluded that we have uh higher value opportunities uh with our with our core mining uh assets. And as such, um you know, you'll recall we took an an impairment decision in in late 2020 uh for some of the unconventional assets that we had um not included in our development plans. So again, this is really um a continuation of of that strategy. We have not made the decision to sell though, so we're going to be looking at you know how do we create maximum value for for us, for our shareholders. Um prior to uh to putting the the assets in the marketplace, we had received uh several unsolicited offers uh for for those assets, um, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. Um, you know, there's been a lot of consolidation that's occurring i in the in the Motney and Duvernay shale uh resource plays and uh you know so it's really the the culmination of all that that uh that drove us to put those assets in the marketplace and uh and and we'll see what we get back. Um we it is a very large resource uh play, um you know, over six hundred and fifty thousand net acres. Um and and so from a uh you know from a a a transaction structure we we are open to uh to selling it in pieces. Um you know we d we do know that there are some industry players that are primarily focused in the Motany. There's others that are primarily focused in the Duvernay. There's some that are in both. So, you know, we we are open to considering uh alternate uh structures for the transaction. Um the key is going to be what delivers the most value and and how does that compare to our view of value if we were to continue to uh to retain the asset and and develop it further ourselves. So uh so we're we're excited to see uh what comes out of the data room and and the bids um you know in another month or so. Thanks for that question. Okay and Phil's uh follow-up I think Dan I'll direct uh straight to you is are you still considering an SIB given the dividend increase? Yeah thanks Phil we talked about this uh you know in in our in our kind of prepared remarks uh but but it's probably worth um talking a little more. I mean the short answer is yes. We are we are considering an SIB and and just stepping back, you know, we we have a long standing philosophy, I think as you know, to return surplus cash to shareholders. You know, it starts with a reliable and growing dividend, which we've demonstrated over many years, and of course this morning's announcement of a sizable increase is is another step in in in that um in that direction. After you know dividends, our next vehicle for surplus cash is the NCIB. NCIB, it's simple, efficient, and flexible. Um we used it certainly to the max in in twenty twenty one. We had a a program we restarted in in May-uneJ. We we bought a bunch of shares. We launched a new program in June. We ended up accelerating that to wrap up early. Over the course of 2021, we repurchased over $2.2 billion through that program. And just uh you know, January 31st, yesterday we wrapped up that program with our acceleration through January 31st of another incremental $450 million dollars so over thirteen months about about two point seven billion dollars uh through the NCIB. But as you know as well, we're limited to five percent of outstanding shares annually in that program. Our next renewal would be late June uh of this year. We we certainly plan to to do that. Um but looking at our cash balances and our outlook, you know, for for for strong cash flow, um we're anticipating taking action on shareholder returns, additional action be before renewal of the NCIB in late June. We haven't made a final decision, but we've certainly heard the market's feedback, um strong preference uh for an SIB and and and that's our lead case at this point. Okay. Um operator, uh can we turn it over to you now, please, to go to the live QA line. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Our first question comes from Dennis Fong with CIBC World Market. You may proceed with your question. Hi, good morning and and thanks for taking my questions. Uh the first one maybe follows in line with uh Dan's comment there on um on returning cash back to shareholders. Obviously Imperial oil is in a enviable position with respect to leverage. Can you maybe describe what you view as the ideal capital structure for in your opinion for the company and how we should be thinking about that? Obviously balancing the available free cash flow that you're generating, the relative capex that you have already outlined with your twenty twenty two guidance, as well as uh the various other levers that you have in returning cash back to shareholders. Thanks. I'll I'll turn that question over to Dan. He can build on his comments about uh about shareholder returns. Yeah, look, you know, we we could uh we have about five billion dollars of debt which we've had for um you know uh, pretty been stable for for for a number of years. We we feel comfortable with that level of debt. You know, given our our leverage uh on an absolute basis and relative to peers is low. Um it's not it's not um our first move to repay the debt. So uh to the extent we have surplus cash um our are really you know once we've exhausted the N C I B it's it's use other mechanisms to to return that to shareholders. So um you know that's maybe a short answer, but I think I think that is um that it in a nutshell. And you see we have a fairly, as I mentioned in my remarks, a fairly modest uh capital program in twenty twenty two. And you know, at current price levels we we anticipate generating significant free cash flow in addition to you know a pretty significant cash balance uh right now. Great, great, thanks. And my second question here is uh more on the offside, so either maybe directed to you, Brad, or to Simon. Um just with respect to Cold Lake, you've obviously seen fairly strong um production levels uh and and a lot of success from the optimization side. You mentioned a little bit around a laser and the the utilization of solvents. Just curious as to how the optimization is is continuing, what maybe some of the next steps happen to be, and what does that potentially mean for a project like Grand Rapids, which was potentially going to ut utilize existing steam infrastructure in the area. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for that question, Dennis. You know, we we are super excited about the progress we're we're making at Cold Lake. Um, you know, we we have put a lot of focus into optimizing the the reservoir performance of of those assets. We've continued to focus on reliability as well. And then, you know, as as you mentioned and and we've commented on this call and in the past, um, you know, we continue to look for ways to employ um kind of next generation solvent technologies uh like laser that achieve multiple objectives for us. Um, you know they, they do have the benefit of enhancing reservoir performance, uh, but equally important they reduce the greenhouse gas emissions uh because they they have lower uh steam and energy intensity. And so, you know, it is a continued strategy of ours to continue to um to deploy uh solvent technologies to enhance Cold Lake's performance. Next on the docket is Grand Rapids Phase I which will uh employ SA SAG D technology. And then looking a little bit longer term, we were evaluating application of a cyclant solvent process. We refer to as CSP, which allows us to replace steam with propane and and achieve even further reductions in uh in greenhouse gas intensity while improving reservoir performance. And in the case of CSP, uh we've we've already piloted that uh quite successfully and and so now looking at the further application. So, you know, I think over over the the coming quarters and years, you're going to continue to hear us talk about the evolution of these technologies, how they're integral to both our reservoir optimization, but also our greenhouse greenhouse gas intensity reduction objectives and and I'm sure in our in our upcoming investor day we'll spend some more time talking about each of those and and how they fit in. Uh thanks thanks for the question and again we're we're very excited about uh about our actions at Cold Lake. Thank you. Um Hey guys, my first question is more on the on the renewable diesel side. I'm just trying to understand if you can give us um I'm sure you'd have some preliminary work. What kind of feed stocks are you looking to run? Soya bean, colo canola. I mean you are in that vegetable oil belt, so is it primarily going to be vegetable oils? Can you bring in some use cooking oil, uh some animal fats and so if you if if I could get some understanding of that. Yeah thanks thanks for that question and and again we're we're we're gonna spend some more time at investor day describing the this project, but kind of at at the the foundation of your question, fundamentally this is going to be plant based materials. Um we're we're we're not looking at um you know animal fat or or or other sorts of uh of supply. It's it's very much focused on um on plant based materials that are sourced generally in the region. You know, we haven't talked explicitly about the the specific type of plant. We're still in commercial discussions with potential suppliers. Um and and so those those uh commercial discussions are still sensitive around the type. Uh but but needless to say there's there's an abundant supply of of available materials and and good options for us that are going to allow us to uh you know ultimately produce 20,000 barrels a day of of very uh competitive supply. Um and and so we're we're really excited about this project, um, you know, uh driven by kind of the overall benefits it'll bring to uh to Canada in in achieving uh you know achieving our um you know total emissions objectives of net zero by twenty fifty. This this is a key contributor to reducing So more to come, but perfect. And again, keeping on the line of emission reductions, you and others have obviously committed to carbon capture and sequestration. But w like w how is it progressing? How are the partner commitments? What are you looking from the government in terms of help? I mean it's a it's an excellent project but we don't get too many details on that carbon capture and sequestration project. So if you could just help us understand how the discussions are progressing between you and all the others and the government for that project. Yeah, thanks for the question. I'm excited to talk about it. Um we're we're we're making I think really, really good progress. Um you know th this is a very complex undertaking uh to achieve net zero by twenty fifty. Uh and and the alliance we've established uh amongst the member companies is unprecedented, the level of of cooperation. The amount of investment that will ultimately be required to get to net zero, you know, we've we've estimated as as seventy, seventy five billion dollars uh from now to twenty fifty. So, you know, it's a huge undertaking. It's not just one um single project, it's multiple projects. Um there there's a foundational project which is building this large trunk line that will allow the transport of carbon uh that's captured in the Fort McMurray area all the way down to the Cold Lake region uh where we've applied with the government for access to poor space so we can um so we can sequester the the carbon there. Um so you know building this large trunk line is is a significant project. But then there's several other projects around the capture side at each of the individual sites where we're you know pr producing uh hydrocarbons today. Um and then on top of that, um you know, as I just talked at Cold Lake, you know, not only are we focused on um capturing carbon and transporting it to a site to store it, but we're also looking at how can we fundamentally reduce the amount of carbon that's generated. And so things like solvent technologies are quite important there. So a lot of moving pieces, uh if you will, to uh to progress this project. But you know, we as as an alliance uh have been able to develop uh preliminary plans around uh kind of the sequence of the trunk line project, the the carbon capture projects as well as other technology initiatives. You know we we will talk more about that on investor day. But I think it's moving quite well. We are also spending a lot of time with both the federal and provincial government around enabling steps that are necessary to progress these huge investments. You know, specifically we are looking for investment tax credit and other financial support from the government given the nature of these investments, the risks associated with them. So so those discussions are are ongoing. Um the the cooperation amongst the companies is just exceptional. Um you know, in in fact as as CEOs, uh the six companies, we we get together every single week and and are having uh discussions about the progress of the project, key priorities, how do we keep it moving along, you know, what are some of the key issues. And again, as I mentioned, we're also actively uh engaged with with the government. as So CEOs we're we're meeting directly with key officials and certainly our our teams are meeting uh with with officials and staffs as well at at both the federal and the provincial levels. So, you know, it's all hands on deck. Um th this is a huge challenge, but we think it's achievable and we think it's necessary and so we're we're gonna do what it takes. That is that is great color and uh hoping to meet you at an in person uh investor day in March. Thank you, thank you. Well I I look forward to meeting you as as well. You know, unfortunately uh the the Omer Cron virus has has uh continued to to delay many in person meetings, but um you know, as soon as as as soon as the opportunity uh uh affords itself I very much look forward to it as well. It's been it's been a long two years, right? So uh so again I look forward to meeting you as well. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug McGee with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I'm delighted to be on your call. Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, I I I wonder if I could start with uh ExxonMobil's announcement yesterday of combining their downstream and chemicals business. I wonder if there's any read through for Imperial as it relates to incremental cost cutting initiatives or whether you follow suit. Yeah, thanks for the question, Doug, and it's it's it's good good to hear your voice. It's been a while since we've connected, so uh so thanks for joining the call today. Um you know, regarding ExxonMobil's announcements yesterday, um super, super exciting news um, you know, for for ExxonMobil and you know, with ExxonMobil being uh majority shareholder of Imperial, we benefit uh from that relationship in many ways. You know, we we often talk about uh the the technology uh benefits that we're able to leverage, kind of their global best practices, some some operational synergies. And and I think all of that comes to play uh with the announcement that was made yesterday. Um you know we're we still have a lot of work to do to fully understand their plans and then see how we can best leverage them and adapt them. But I I fully expect um that we will within Imperial see benefits uh from you know their announcements, the strategies that that they're progressing. And like I said, we're we're super excited. Okay, thank you for that. My my follow up is I I don't want to get ahead of myself here for your upcoming analyst day. I it it seems Exxon has also decided to go virtual and unfortunately, so I dunno what you ultimately decide. But um but my question is specifically on Carol. W when you laid out the kind of reliability trajectory um towards twenty twenty five, um it seems that you're well on your way to that. You're probably a little bit ahead of the pace I would guess. Is there any any thoughts you could you could provide in terms of the timing or the scale of what you ultimately see Carol doing on that original timeline? I'll leave it there. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for that question and and and you're right, you know, it is isn't un unfortunate some of the the impacts that uh that COVID has had on uh on plans from yesterday, you know, it impacted us last year, has the risk of impacting us this year. But you know, we're we're committed to uh to engaging uh you know with our investors, our analyst and and sharing our our forward plans. I think it's a very it's a very positive story. Um you know and and in terms of curl, you you're exactly right. You know, each year uh over the last couple of years we we continue to set new records at curl and uh you know and so as I mentioned, you know, we just completed twenty twenty one with uh two hundred sixty three thousand barrels a day um gross. Um our guidance for next year is two sixty five to two seventy, um which again moves us one step closer to to two eighty which as is as you accurately note, we had previously indicated that that we would get to 280 in that 2025 time frame, but we are well ahead of that. Um and and at investor day, you know, we'll lay out kind of a revised plan. But but but safe to say it's you know there's a lot of organizational focus on how we can get to that two hundred eighty thousand level sooner than than twenty twenty five. And and so, you know, some of the things we we've already done that will contribute are things like uh moving to one turnaround per year, which we achieved a year earlier than than what we shared at last investor day. Um we have multiple debottlenecking projects uh that that we're progressing. We're continuing to look at how do we optimize um you know ore recovery and uh and movement uh in in the mines and and then you know uh taking full advantage of of digital. Um you know I've talked on on prior calls about how we're employing multiple um digital techniques that are adding real value to us and you know that will also have beneficial effects on our production rates. So you know I I still f I I think 265 to 270 is is is appropriate for 2022, um but but you can see that's going to step us to 280 quicker than than the twenty twenty-five timeframe. And we'll, you know, Simon at Investor Day will give a lot more detail about those individual projects. Thanks for the full answer, guys. I look forward to it. Thanks again. Thanks Doc. Yeah, thanks, good morning, and thanks for the rundown as is always very thorough. Um again at the risk of probably jumping ahead, but but y uh y y yeah, Brad you mentioned, you know, that there are steps you're taking to strengthen the downstream business. I'm just wondering if if there are any things you can kinda share and whether the um you know like I'm assuming the product's pipeline you know fits into that mix but any color there would be great. Yeah thanks for the question Greg and and and you're right we'll we'll give a much more comprehensive story um at uh at Investor Day. But you know, it it it starts fundamentally with our cost structure and as I mentioned we've done a lot of things uh a around our cost structure um and and I feel really good uh about that and then it's it it's ensuring that we are leveraging um you know all the synergy that we have uh based on our our location of our three refineries, um the integration that they have between themselves but that they also have um with our upstream production assets um and then you know ensuring that we maximize the flexibility of their run slate you know, which has been key through the pandemic as we've had to adjust to much lower jet demand and move that into other products. And then look at where we have an opportunity to grow new product outlets. You know, we've talked about things we've done with asphalt uh over the last couple of years and how that's you know an increasing part of our portfolio and again leverages on our on our our heavy crude slate. Um and then you know most recently of course you, know, the the shred project and our ability to generate uh you know renewable diesel at Strathcona will be a key um strategic undertaking for us. Um and then of course uh you know the integration we have between uh Sarnia Refinery and Sarnia Chemical Plant also allows us to um you know f,urther capture market and value. And uh so again, you know, that that's kind of a broad brush on it. Uh you know John Wetmore uh will will give a much more comprehensive story at uh at Investor Day but uh but exciting opportunities for us uh in the downstream. Okay. No terrific. And and maybe now uh it's probably more of a question for Dan but, I mean just as an observation and we've been talking about a Civ for a long time. Um but w and I totally understand where you guys are coming from in terms of evaluation, but but maybe Dan specifically would it be possible for you to just frame what the mechanics are? Like I've never worked through one of these uh from that standpoint and and is it possible just to again enlighten us in terms of blackouts? Like I'm not trying to pin you down on the date per se because you're sort of saying within the June time frame. But I just I think I'd love to know what what needs to go into this in terms of formalizing your decision process. Yeah, I mean th technically the technicalities or the of an SIB I mean it requires a filing, it's it's open for thirty five days. Generally speaking you you you you shouldn't do it during during a blackout period, which which is typically sort of thirty days before earnings release. So that that's the that's sort of the um the the timing and technicalities of it. Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks, Greg. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Meta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Thanks so much. One of the core competencies that you've had and you brought into the business is is your background around MA given uh your prior role at at Exxon. And just be curious on your own perspective of of do you view Imperial as a logical consolidator, especially in light of the deferred tax uh position and and uh your success at turning around operations and and uh and scale and cost of capital. And it uh and if so, how do you think about balancing that versus return of capital? So big picture question, but any thoughts would be uh appreciated. Yeah, thanks Neil and and good to hear from you. Um you know, as we've said in the past, um we continue to keep an open mind, an open aperture around potential uh MA opportunities. Um it's it's not our top priority. Our top priority uh centers around our existing asset base um and maximizing value from those assets which I I think we we have demonstrated uh success over over the last couple of years and and has us well positioned for the future with you know, some very long life assets that um, you know, under under favorable markets will continue to generate significant cash. And uh so when we look at potential M and A opportunities, we we need to convince ourselves that not only do they fit into a long term strategy, but but they are accretive and and they do compete for capital relative to um you know the the the brownfield investments that that we already have identified and and are progressing. Um you know, we're we're not uh driven to acquire something just to grow for the sake of growing. In fact, you know, I think we've demonstrated our ability to grow with the existing asset base. So, you know, now this year we're at two sixty three, we expect to grow that to two sixty five to two seventy. And and within a relatively short time frame, you know, I expect we'll be at at two eighty or or higher. And so in a few short years we we will have added eighty thousand barrels a day of growth in our portfolio at a cost much, much lower than you know any acquisition we we could have contemplated. So that will continue to be the the priority is, you know, making sure we first focus on our existing assets. But, you know, there is a lot of consolidation occurring and uh and you know we we want to make sure we are making thoughtful decisions and so you know we we look at uh potential acquisitions and evaluate them and we discuss them as a management team and um and and you know that guides us accordingly. So so hope that answered your question. framework, Brad. And the the follow up is just around cash taxes. Can you just remind us, uh team, how you're how you're thinking about your deferred tax position. Good problem to have, to have a lot of earnings per share. Um but I would imagine that would also uh c take in create some considerations that we need to uh embed in the model going forward. Yeah, a absolutely. And Dan and his team spend a lot of time thinking about that and so I'll I'll ask him to answer. Yeah, well uh you know, just for the record, we're against cash taxes. Um if you didn't know our position, but uh we c you know, j we don't expect well in twenty twenty one uh actual actual cash taxes will be you know quite small. Twenty twenty two will be sort of a transition year and by twenty twenty three, you know, a current you know, with current you know economic conditions we'd expect to be to be fully tax paying. So, you know, I think that's probably as much as I I can tell you, but um well on a on a pure cash basis out the door um we should pay uh less than the statutory rate in in twenty twenty two, but by twenty twenty three, you know, we'll be full fully tax paying on on a cash basis. That's kind of where we are. Makes sense, Dan. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Men O'Holoshop with TD Securities. You may proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone, and uh thanks for uh squeezing me in. Uh most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I'll just uh to round things out with cost inflation. We have a pretty good sense of what that could look like for upstream across the the industry. But what what are you seeing in terms of cost pressures for downstream and would you be able to provide uh separate ranges for the two? Yeah, thanks for the question and and no doubt that is a uh is is an emerging theme, you know, a across industry and and and more broadly society right now with inflationary pressures from from lots of angles. You know, I I think um you know fortunately uh for us uh we we haven't seen huge impacts of of inflationary pressures yet, um but that's not to say we we won't going forward. You know, probably the single largest uh impact we've had i is around our own energy costs. Um, you know, where where we we we purchase natural gas um you know for for our facilities. Um and and obviously, you know, we all know what's happened there, but you know, as uh as as somebody who also produces uh energy, you know, on balance that's that's still favorable for us. Um you know we're we're taking a close look at other consumable supplies and things like that and you know first making sure we we we have access to the supplies and we're not impacted by any market shortages, um, but then also looking at, you know, how we can optimize the the cost and and mitigate any any cost pressures. Um, you know, where we could see, you know, more significant impacts would be things like um you know steel, for example. But the good news is, you know, when when we look at um our large projects um you know for for next year. You know, we talk about Sarnia Products Pipeline, you know, that project is essentially complete, steel bought, you know, a a long time ago. Um the curl in pit tailings project is you know has some steel associated with it, again, most of which has already been been procured, but it's more of a um you know earth moving project uh than than anything, um very labor intensive and so we got to keep an eye on labor costs but but again so far we we haven't seen huge impacts there. So something we're going to keep a very close eye on going forward. But but so far we've we've been able to manage it quite well. Thanks, Brad. I'll leave it there. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Our next question. Council Bill Gresh with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Yes, hi, good morning. My first question is on the on the dividend. Obviously, as you noted, two very large increases uh in the past two years since the last time uh you had an analyst day. Um and you had talked about you know a certain breakeven level uh at that time. So I I I was just wondering if you could refresh us on how you think about what that break even would be today. And then as you go forward, um, how do you think about sustainable levels of increases in the dividend um with respect to you know a break even framework or however else you might look at it for the question I think d Dan will give us an answer on that. Yeah, hey Phil we,'ll we'll talk more about break evens uh at the analyst day. I mean last year we we talked about um um uh you know thirty six bucks with um you know uh both including uh sustaining capital and dividend. I think that that's st stillill a a good number. So we're we're pretty far way away from that. So it is important to us obviously that w we the dividend a s a sustainable and growing dividend is is our is our core kind of but one of our core investor uh offerings and and we do think about that and we and we feel given given our outlook that that that the seven cents is is warranted and we feel quite good about it uh going forward. Um so I guess it's probably as much as much as I'll say, but you know our break even is is well below current prices. So um that gives us a lot of comfort. And obviously as we go forward we continue to, you know, we've had energy inflation as has been discussed, um, but we continue to work on our base cost structure. Um so you know obviously we want to get that break even down at as low as low as we can. Understood. Okay, thank you. Um and then just one other question on um the OpEx in the quarter. Obviously it was up sequentially. Um I wasn't sure if some of the one time costs that you called out in any way um flowed through OpEx or not, but just in general, um, you know, latest OpEx and twenty two. Yeah, of that, you know, hundred and sixty million, there there's a lot of things in there. There's there's deferred tax adjustments, there there's life phone inventory changes. But there's there's there's also I'd say sixty million dollars of OpEx in the upstream included in that number. So yeah, part part of that's uh uh part part of that one sixty is one time opex from some smaller Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks, Phil. Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would not like to turn the call back over to Dave Hughes for any further remarks. Alright. Well thank you very much, and thank you everybody for uh joining us this morning. As usual, if you have any further questions, uh please don't hesitate to reach out to us at any time. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Hughes, Vice-President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll start by introducing, uh, you to the management team we have in attendance. Uh, Brad Corson, Chairman, President and CEO; Dan Lyons, Senior Vice-President of Finance and Administration; Simon Younger, Senior Vice-President of the Upstream; Sherri Evers, Vice-President of Commercial and Corporate Development; and Jon Wetmore, Vice-President of the Downstream. So I'll just quickly go over the cautionary statement. Today's comments include reference to non- GAAP financial measures. The definitions and reconciliations of these measures can be found in Attachment 6 of our most recent press release and are available on our website with the link to this conference call. Today's comments may also contain forward-looking information and any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and actual future financial performance and operating results can differ materially depending on a number of factors and assumptions. Forward-looking information of the risk factors and assumptions are described in further detail on our fourth quarter earnings press release that we issued this morning, as well as our most recent Form 10-K, and all of these documents are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website, so I'd ask you to please refer to those. So just before I turn it over to Brad for his opening remarks, once he's done and- and he and Dan go over our financial and operating performance for the quarter, we will be moving to the Q&A session, as usual. So with that, I'll turn it over to Brad. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope each of you are doing well and are of good health to start the new year. As we bring 2021 to a close, well, at least from a reporting point of view, I would like to repeat something I said on the third quarter call. Wow, what a difference a year makes. I'm very pleased to report that we finished the year strong, with another quarter of solid operating performance and strong financial results. In 2020, we focused heavily on ensuring Imperial was well-positioned to take advantage of the market recovery through ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure, improving our reliability and progressing high return brownfield projects. And you can now see the benefits of those efforts in our 2021 results as we continued to make the most of the improving and attractive business environment. This performance was reflected in all business lines, although we did see some pretty challenging weather to close out the year. And as it has all year, this performance allowed us to return a material amount of cash to shareholders in the quarter and in fact, to accelerate the pace of these returns, resulting in around $3 billion for the full year, the highest level in the company's history. Throughout 2021, we continued to manage the ongoing challenges due to COVID-19. Our focus on maintaining the health and safety of our workforce was key, not only in minimizing disruptions to our operations, but also, and most importantly, in ensuring the wellbeing of our people. From a business perspective, we saw continued demand recovery throughout the year and significant improvement in commodity prices, both of which are reflected in our results. Over the next few minutes, Dan and I will detail the results o- of what was a very strong quarter. So now, let's turn more specifically to the fourth quarter results. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $813 million and our cash from operating activities was over $1.6 billion, both somewhat lower versus the third quarter. Earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $ 160 million in onetime non-cash events. And cash flow, excluding working capital effects, was up more than $100 million, reflecting our strong operating performance and the strong commodity fundamentals in the quarter. Crude prices continued to strengthen through the quarter while both downstream and chemical margins remained strong. Our upstream continued to perform very well, delivering its highest annual production in over 30 years. And our downstream performed well also. We saw utilization of 97% for the quarter and higher product sales as demand continued to recover. Our chemical business closed out the year with another strong quarter and delivered the highest full year earnings in over 30 years. As expected, polyethylene margins did soften somewhat in the quarter but remained strong and supported the best ever full year earnings for this business. So in total, our strong cash flow generation in a period of strong commodity prices was underpinned by continued strong operational performance. We were able to take advantage of attractive markets for crude, refined products and chemicals. And all of this contributes to a very strong cash position, which continues to allow us to deliver on our priority of returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned $950 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and accelerated share buybacks. For the year, we've generated about $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities, and around $4.5 billion of free cash flow. And we put this cash to good use. Early in the year, we announced the largest quarterly dividend in the company's history and re-instituted our share buyback program, which we suspended in 2020 due to the business environment brought on by the pandemic. And in the fourth quarter, we announced an acceleration of the renewed NCIB. All of this resulted in the return of nearly $3 billion of cash to our shareholders in the year. 2021 marks the 27th consecutive year of dividend increases. And you would've seen us continue this trend with the announcement this morning of another significant dividend increase of $0.07 per share, which is around 26%, our largest dividend increase in history. This equates to a 55% increase since the beginning of 2021 and represents an increase of almost 80% since the beginning of 2019. Going forward, following yesterday's completion of our accelerated NCIB and today's announcement of a sizeable dividend increase, we remain committed to returning surplus cash to shareholders and are actively evaluating our next steps in this area, including a potential substantial issuer bid. We are unwavering in our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and delivering further shareholder value and returns. I'll now turn it over to Dan to go through our financial performance for the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brad. Getting into the financial results for the full year, we recorded net income of almost $2.5 billion, an increase of around $3.2 billion, excluding the onetime $1.2 billion non-cash impairment charge related to our unconventional business that we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our net income was $813 million. Excluding identified items, net income increased almost $800 million from the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by stronger realizations in the upstream and improved margins in the downstream and chemicals. Now if we look sequentially, our fourth quarter income of $813 million is down about $95 million from the third quarter of this year. As Brad noted, the fourth quarter results include a number of unrelated onetime non-cash charges, totaling about $160 million. Looking at each business line. The upstream recorded net income of $545 million, up $20 million from our third quarter net income of $524 million as a result of higher realizations in volumes, partly offset by higher operating expenses driven in part by mine progress spend at Kearl and higher energy costs. Upstream results included a number of onetime charges of about $85 million. The downstream recorded net income of $250 million, down $43 million from net income of $293 million in the third quarter. Downstream results included a number of onetime charges totaling around $75 million. Chemicals continue to demonstrate strong performance in fourth quarter, with net income of $64 million, down about $60 million from the third quarter this year as polyethylene prices moderated from the extreming… extremely strong levels seen in the third quarter. Moving on to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an improvement of about $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020. Our free cash flow for the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Looking at the full year, our strong results and capital discipline delivered free cash flow of almost $4.5 billion. As we start 2022, strong commodity prices, along with our continued cost and capital discipline, position us well to generate very substantial free cash flow going forward. Moving on to CapEx. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $441 million, up from $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Full year capital expenditures were in line with the revised guidance at just over $1.1 billion. Capital spending in 2021 was focused on progressing key projects, such as Kearl input tailings infrastructure and the Sarnia products pipeline. We also continued to invest in improving volumes through projects like the solvent assisted LASER project at our Mahkeses Cold Lake plant and improving the efficiency and cost structure of our operations by continuing to invest in projects like our autonomous haul truck fleet and related infrastructure, as well as installing our first boiler flue gas heat recovery unit at Kearl. In December, we announced our 2022 capital guidance at $1.4 billion, reflecting our strong ongoing capital discipline. In the upstream at Kearl, capital spending includes the ramp up of the Kearl input tailings project, ongoing investment in our autonomous truck fleet and installing additional boiler flue gas heat recovery units. At Cold Lake, we will work on developing phase one of our Grand Rapids project, continue to progress solvent assisted LASER, as well as infield drilling and well work. In the downstream, spending includes the completion and commissioning of the Sarnia products pipeline and spending on the Strathcona renewable diesel project. We will have an opportunity to discuss these plans in more detail at our investor day. Shifting to shareholder distributions. As I mentioned earlier, we generated about $4.5 billion of free cash flow in 2021. This performance supported record returns of almost $3 billion of cash to shareholders, including returns of about $950 million in the fourth quarter alone. We repurchased 17.5 million shares for $761 million in the quarter under an accelerated program, bringing our full year buyback to 56 million shares for over $2.2 billion. We paid dividends of $188 million in the fourth quarter and a total of over $700 million for the full year. Despite these record distributions, we ended the year with about $2.2 billion of cash on hand. Consistent with our previous announcement, we continued our accelerated NCIB purchases in January 2022 and completed this program on January 31st. We also declared an increased dividend of $0.34 per share, payable on April 1. Furthermore, as Brad mentioned, in light of our current cash balance and the strong business outlook, we're actively evaluating options for additional shareholder returns, including a potential substantial issuer bid. Now I'll turn it back to Brad to discuss our operational performance. Thanks, Dan. As we switch our focused operations, I would sum up the fourth quarter as being another strong quarter operationally across all business lines. In the upstream, we average 445,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, which is an increase of 10,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter, but is down 15,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease year-on-year was due mainly to an early start to winter. In fact, Alberta saw several weeks of extreme arctic temperatures in the last half of December and early January, which, as you know, present some operational challenges, particularly in our mining operations. At our investor day in late 2020, we communicated our intent to focus the upstream organization's efforts on maximizing the performance of our existing asset base. And given how the assets performed in 2021, I would say, we are on that strategy in achieving it and it's also paying off for us. In fact, our full year 2021 production was 428,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, which is the highest in over 30 years and exceeded our guidance for the year. I would also note the current market environment and the strong commodity prices we are seeing. While in the fourth quarter, there were a number of factors which drove the WTI- WCS spreads wider, such as the phase startup of line three and other smaller disruptions, we are now seeing narrower spreads and are well-positioned to continue to benefit from this. So now, let's move on and talk about Kearl. Production at Kearl in the fourth quarter averaged 270,000 barrels per day growth, which was down 4,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter and 14, 000 barrels per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. As I mentioned, Western Canada saw an early start to winter, feeling the effects of the deep freeze that started late in the fourth quarter and extended into the new year. And as we have talked about in the past, extended periods of extreme cold weather can be challenging for our operations, and particularly, mining. The result of these weather challenges was lower than expected production in the fourth quarter at Kearl, with an estimated impact of around 13,000 barrels per day in the quarter, or just over 3,000 barrels per day on a full year basis. The impacts of the extreme cold weather continued to linger into January, but I'm pleased to say that as of now, our operations have essentially returned to normal. I would also like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous dedication of our workforce whose efforts to safely maintain our operations in these extreme conditions and mitigate the production impacts are a huge credit to the organization. Despite the weather impacts, total full year production for Kearl was 263,000 barrels per day, the highest in the assets history. This compares to 222,000 barrels per day in 2020, an increase of 41,000 barrels per day for the year. And as Kearl continues to deliver on its production reliability c- commitments, including the elimination of the second annual turnaround, a full year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we continue to be excited about Kearl's potential as we make progress on our accelerated journey to 280,000 barrels per day. And despite the slower start to the year, we reiterate our 2022 guidance of 265 to 270… our 2022 guidance of 265 to 270,000 barrels per day, reflecting the next step in production growth at the site. I would also note that this 2022 guidance reflects one major planned turnaround, expected to be executed in the second quarter of the year. I'd like to wrap up our discussion about Curl with some comments about unit cost. Another positive reflection of the asset's performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, continued pressure from higher energy prices and the strength of the Canadian dollar, presented some challenges in meeting our unit cash cost target of US$ 20 per barrel. In 2021, higher energy costs and the strength of the Canadian Dollar represented approximately an incremental $2.50 per barrel relative to 2020. However, if we normalized for energy costs and forex, both items ou- outside our control, our unit costs would have achieved a reduction of almost $1 per barrel from 2020 and been below the target of US$ 20 per barrel. Close management of unit costs continues to be core to our approach to maximizing profitability at CURL. And we remain focused on achieving further unit cost reductions as we go forward. So now let's talk about Cold Lake. Cold Lake has been a really positive story throughout 2021. Production for the quarter averaged 142,000 barrels per day, which was up 7000 barrels per day versus the third quarter, and 6000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. This strong performance reflects the benefits of our continued focus on production optimization and reliability. And while Cold Lake experienced the same stream- same extreme cold temperatures in December, it did not have a material impact given the nature of this operation. For the year, production averaged 140,000 barrels per day, exceeding our updated guidance of 135,000 barrels per day. Our full year production at Cold Lake was driven by significant improvement to the base performance highlighting the effectiveness of our strategy to focus on reliability and optimization. We also saw the benefits from recent drilling operations which contribute almost 2000 barrels per day of production for the year. We are looking forward to continuing to benefit from these improvements in the coming year. And for 2022, we have issued guidance of 135,000 to 140,000 barrels per day for Cold Lake. Which includes a typical plant turnaround in the second quarter. Now at Syncrude, Imperial's share of production for the quarter averaged 79,000 barrels per day, which was up slightly from 78,000 barrels per day in the thir- third quarter. But down 8000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2020. Unplanned downtime, coupled with extreme cold weather, presented challenges for these operations in December as detailed in the statement issued by the operator, Suncor, earlier in January. We estimate the impact to be close to 5000 barrels per day, our share in the quarter. Imperial's share of full year production averaged 71,000 barrels per day, an increase of 2000 barrels per day versus 2020. As the ownership continues its focus on improving asset reliability, we reiterate our guidance for 2022 of 75 to 80,000 barrels per day. This guidance reflects the impacts of planned maintenance in the second quarter and a major coker turnaround in the third quarter. 2021 also marked a change in the operating structure at Syncrude and we remain confident that this change will better support the continued focus on improved reliability and cost performance for this asset. So now moving to the downstream. We refined an average of 416,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, which was up 12,000 barrels a day versus the third quarter of 2021, and up 57,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting the strong operating performance and the continuation of demand recovery we have seen throughout 2021. The fourth quarter throughput equates to a utilization of 97%, which is the highest fourth quarter utilization in over 30 years. This represents a 3% increase over the third quarter, bringing our full year utilization to 89%, which is right on the guidance we provided for 2021. And for the year, throughput was 379,000 barrels per day, up 39,000 barrels per day versus 2020. Looking forward to 2022, we have a fairly light turnaround year planned, supporting our increased guidance for 2022 of 92 to 94% utilization. Looking at cash operating costs, our downstream business continues to do an exceptional job in managing its operating costs. Full year cash operating costs were down $70 million compared to 2020 and down even more when normalizing for the rising energy prices we saw in 2021. This decrease is especially notable because over the same period, our refining throughput increased by 39,000 barrels per day and our petroleum product sales grew by 35,000 barrels per day. So we are refining more barrels and selling more product, and we're doing it at a lower absolute cost. And again, this was a year of significant turnaround activity and higher energy costs. Petroleum product sales in the fourth quarter were 496,000 barrels per day, up 11,000 barrels per day from the third quarter on continued strong demands, and up 80,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting significant recovery from the pandemic-related softness of 2020. We continue to see industry demand trends pretty consistent with what we saw through 2021. With gasoline and diesel demands hovering around 90 to 95% of historical levels, and jet continuing to improve, averaging around 70 to 75%. However, as mentioned, jet continues to be somewhat volatile as we experience subsequent waves of COVID-19 and the associated restrictions related to travel. Also of note is that our jet sales volumes continue to track about 10% ahead of industry, predominantly related to competitive gains we were able to capture in 2021, increasing our overall market share. And with respect to downstream margins, unlike crude prices our fourth quarter crack spreads continued to hover around the middle of the five year band, which reflects fairly steady improvement over early 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. And despite ongoing demand volatility, our continued focus on reliable and efficient operations ensures we are capturing as much value as possible in the current downstream pricing environment. Looking forward to 2022, the outlook is positive as we continue to see improvements in the market environment, driving further strengthening of our downstream business which supports our continued journey back to typical earnings and cash flows for this business segment. And I'll wrap up our operating results with chemicals. 2021 was an incredible year for this key part of our business and I just can't say enough about how pleased I am with the performance it delivered, making the most of capturing a very favorable market environment. The fourth quarter was another solid quarter. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $64 million supported by continued strong production, reliability and margins. Fourth quarter earnings were down $57 million versus the third quarter which I will- will remind you was the highest quarterly earnings in over 30 years. This reduction was driven largely by expected softening of polyethylene margins. And while margins did soften somewhat in the quarter, they still remained quite strong and that sets the chemical business up well for a strong 2022. Four year chemical earnings were $361 million, $74 million higher than the previous full year record of $287 million, set in 2015. An outstanding year for our chemicals business, which continues to be a differentiator for us. The integrated nature of our business supports a long history of profitability, even in a year like 2020. And we expect this to continue even as we see polyethylene prices normalizing somewhat. And just before wrapping up, I wanted to highlight a couple of other important items of note. First, we announced our plans to market our interest in XTO Energy Canada a few weeks ago, which of- as you will recall is our unconventional business. We have been quite open recently about where this business fits into our longer term upstream strategy and our decision to market the assets is fully consistent with this. To be clear though, no decision has been made to sell these assets. But in our view, we felt it was appropriate to test the market in the event there is an opportunity to generate increased value through a potential sales transaction. I also wanted to highlight the announcements we made recently on Imperial's plans for further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions intensity over the next decade to help support Canada's net zero goals. Imperial has set a 2030 goal to reduce scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our operated oil sands facilities by 30%, compared with 2016 levels. This target builds on our previous 2023 commitment, which we are well on track to deliver. I'm quite proud of the progress we've made to date in reducing the intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions at our operated oil sands assets. And our recent announcement is another step in our journey to net zero at our operated oil sands assets by 2050. So in closing, another strong quarter which brings to a close a year of very strong results, both operationally and financially. As you have heard me say before, the decisions we have made and the work the organization has done over the past several quarters is allowing us to take maximum advantage of the prevailing market conditions. And this performance supports our ongoing commitment to drive increased shareholder value and our continued commitment to shareholder returns. As you heard Dan and I mention, in 2021 we returned nearly $3 billion to our shareholders via our reliable and growing dividend and share buybacks. And we are also excited to reinforce our commitments to sustainability, not only with our recent announced greenhouse gas intensity reduction target, but with our participation in the Pathways Initiative, an unprecedented industry alliance. Our long term focus on reducing our environmental footprint through investments in things like solvent technologies and carbon capture and storage underpin our confidence in meeting these goals. Looking forward to 2022, we continue to see support for commodity prices and fully expect to deliver another year of strong operational performance, underpinning our ability to take utmost advantage of the current market conditions. We will continue our focus on reduced emissions and sustainability, including our plans for renewable diesel at our Strathcona refinery. We will remain disciplined with respect to spending levels, both operating and capital. And we will also continue to return cash in excess of these needs to our shareholders. And finally, I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support. I hope you're as excited about 2022 as we are. Thank you and back to you, Dave. Okay. We're gonna move to the Q& A now. We did have a couple of, uh, questions pre-submitted which we'll get to first and then we'll go to the live Q&A line. So the two questions came from Phil Skolnick at Eight Capital. The first one, What are you and ExxonMobil looking for in order to make a decision on marketing the XTO assets? Would you consider selling it in pieces? Yeah, thanks for that question, Phil. And, and as, as you know, we, we announced earlier, um, in January our intention to market those assets jointly with, with ExxonMobil. Uh, and in fact we, we've progressed those activities now, have the data room open. Um, there, there is a lot of interest. And, you know, our, our decision around marketing was really driven by, um, the strategic work we have done over the last couple of years where we have prioritized our focus on, on certain assets in our portfolio. And, uh, and, and really prioritized our capital as well. And, and through that work, we, we have concluded that we have, uh, higher value opportunities, uh, with our, with our core mining, uh, assets. And as such, um, you know, you'll recall we took an- an impairment decision in, in late 2020, uh, for some of the unconventional assets that we had, um, not included in our development plans. So again, this is really, um, a continuation of, of that strategy. We have not made the decision to sell though. So we're gonna be looking at, um, you know, how do we create maximum value for, for us, for our shareholders? Um, prior to, uh, to putting the, the assets in the marketplace, we had received, uh, several unsolicited offers, uh, for, for those assets. Um, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. Um, you know, there's been a lot of consolidation that's occurring i- in the- in the Montney and Duvernay shale, uh, resource plays. And, uh, you know, so it's really the, the culmination of all that that, uh, that drove us to put those assets in the marketplace. And, uh, and, and we'll see what we get back. Um, we, it is a very large resource, uh, play. Um, you know, over 650,000 net acres. Um, and, and so from a, uh, you know, from a, a, a transaction structure, we, we are open to, uh, to selling it in pieces. Um, you know, we, we do know that there are some industry players that are primarily focused on the Montney. There's others that are primarily focused in the Duvernay. Um, there's some that are in both. Uh, so, you know, we, we are open to considering, uh, alternate, uh, structures for the transaction. Um, the key is gonna be what delivers the most value and, and how does that compare to our view of value, if we were continue to, uh, to retain the asset and, and develop it further ourselves? Um, so, uh, so we're- we're excited to see, uh, what comes out of the data room and, and the bids, um, you know, in another month or so. Thanks for that question. Okay. And Phil's, uh, follow up, I think Dan I'll direct, uh, straight to you. Is are you still considering an SIB given the dividend increase? Yeah, thanks Phil. We talked about this, uh, you know, in our- in our kind of prepared remarks. Uh, but, but it's probably worth, um, talking a little more. I mean, the short answer is yes. We are- we are considering an SIB. And, and just stepping back, you know, we, we have a long standing philosophy, I think, as you know to return surplus cash to shareholders. You know, it starts with a reliable and growing dividend, which we've demonstrated over many years. And, and, of course this morning's announcement of a-… we've demonstrated over many years, and, and, of course, JU this morning's announcement of a sizable increase is, is another step in, in, in that, um, in that direction. Um, after, you know, dividends, our next vehicle for surplus cash is the NCIB, NCIB, it's simple, efficient and flexible. Um, we used it certainly to the max in, in 2021. We had a, a program where restarted in, in may, June. We, we, we bought a bunch of shares. We launched a new program in June. We ended up accelerating that to, to wrap up early. Um, over the course of 2021, we repurchased, uh, over 2.2 billion through that program. And just, uh, you, January 31st, yesterday, we wrapped up that program with our acceleration through January 31st of another incremental $450 million. So over 13 months, about, about $2.7 billion, uh, through the NCIB. But as you know as well, we're limited to 5% of outstanding shares annually in that program. Um, our next renewal would be late June, uh, of this year. We, we certainly plan to, to do that. Um, but looking at our cash balances and our outlook, you know, for, for, for strong cash flow, um, we're anticipating taking action on shareholder returns, additional action be- before renewal of the NCIB in late June. We haven't made a final decision, but we certainly heard the market's feedback, um, strong preference, uh, for NCIB, and, and that's our lead case at this point. Okay. Um, operator, uh, can we turn it over to you now, please, to go to the live Q&A line? Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you'll need to press * 1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the # key. Our first question comes from Dennis Fong with CIBC World Market. You may proceed with your question. Hi, good morning, and, and thanks for taking my questions. Uh, the first one follows in line with, uh, Dan's comment there on, um, on returning cash back to shareholders. Obviously, Imperial Oils in an enviable position with respect to leverage. Can you maybe describe what you view as the ideal capital structure for, in your opinion for the company, and how we should be thinking about that, obviously balancing the available free cash that you're generating, the relative CapEx that you have already outlined with your 2022 guidance, as well as, uh, the various other leverage that you have in returning cash back to shareholders, thanks. I'll, I'll turn that question over to Danny, he can build on his comments about, uh, about shareholder returns. Yeah, look, you know, we, we could, uh, we have about $5 billion of debt, which had for, um, you know, pretty been stable for, for, for a number of years. We, we feel comfortable with that level of debt, you know, given our, our leverage, uh, on an absolute basis and relative to peers is low. Um, it's not, it's not, um, our first move to repay the debt. So, uh, to the extent we have surplus cash, um, are, are really, you know, once we've exhausted the NCIB it's, it's used other mechanisms to, to return that to shareholders. So, um, you know, that's maybe a short answer, but I think, I think that is, um, that in a nutshell, and you see, we have a fairly, as I mentioned in my remarks, a fairly modest capital program in 2022, and, you know, at current price levels, we, we anticipate generating significant free cash flow in addition to, you know, a pretty significant cash balance, uh, right now. Great, great, thanks. And my second point in here is, uh, more on the upside, so they're maybe directed to you Brad, or to Simon. um, just with respect to Cold Lake, you've obviously seen fairly strong, um, production levels, uh, and, and a lot of success from the optimization side. You mentioned a little bit around a laser and the, the utilization of solvents, just curious as to how the optimization is, is continuing, what maybe some of the next steps happen to be, and what does that potentially mean for project like Grand Rapids, which was potentially going to ut- utilize existing, uh, steam infrastructure in the area. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks for that question, um, Dennis, um, you know, we, we are super excited about the progress we're, we're making that Cold Lake. Um, you know, we, we have put a lot of focus into optimizing the, the reservoir performance of, of those assets. We've continued to focus on reliability as well. And then, you know, as, as you mentioned, and, and we've commented on this call and in the past, uh, you know, we continue to look for ways to employ, um, kind of next generation solvent technologies, uh, like laser that achieve multiple objectives for us. Um, you know, they, they do have the benefit of enhancing reservoir performance, um, but equally important, they reduced the greenhouse gas emissions, uh, because they, they have lower, uh, steam and energy intensity. And so, you know, it is a continued strategy of ours to continue to, um, to deploy, uh, solvent technologies to enhance Cold Lake's performance. Um, you know, next on the docket is, uh, is Grand Rapids phase one, uh, which will, uh, employ SA- SAGD technology. And then looking a little bit longer term, uh, we, we're evaluating application of a Cyclic Solvent Process, uh, we refer to a CSP which allows us to replace steam with propane and, and achieve even further reductions in, uh, in greenhouse gas intensity while improving reservoir performance. And in the case of CSP, uh, we've, we've already piloted that, uh, quite successfully, and so, now looking at the further applications. So, you know, I think over, over the, the coming quarters and, and years you're are gonna continue to hear us talk about the evolution of these technologies, how they're integral to both our, our reservoir optimization, but also our, our greenhouse, greenhouse gas intensity reduction objectives. And, and I'm sure in our, in our upcoming Investor Day, we'll spend some more time talking about each of those and, and how they fit in. Uh, thanks, thanks for the question. And again, we're, we're very excited about, uh, about our actions at Cold Lake. Thank you. Our next question comes from inaudible with Credit inaudible. You may proceed with your question. Um, hey guys, my first question is more on the, on the renewable diesel side. I'm just trying to understand if you can give us some… I'm sure you've done some preliminary work. What kind of feed stocks are you looking to run? Soya bean, canola. I mean, you're in that vegetable oil belt, so is it primarily going to be vegetable oil? Can you bring in some use cooking oil, uh, some animal fats. And so, if you, if, if I could get some understanding of that. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that question. And, and again, we're, we're, we're gonna spend some more time at Investor Day describing the, this project. But, um, kind of, at, at the, the foundation of, of your question, fundamentally, this is gonna be plant-based materials. Um, we're, we're, we're not looking at, um, you know, animal fat or, or, or other sorts of, uh, of supply. It's, it's very much focused on, um, on plant-based materials that are sourced, um, generally in the region. Um, you know, we haven't talked explicitly about, um, the, the specific type of plant. We're still in commercial discussions with potential suppliers. Um, and, and so, those, those, uh, commercial discussions are still sensitive around the type. Uh, but, but needless to say, there's, there's an abundant supply of, of available materials and, and good options for us that are gonna allow us to, uh, you know, ultimately produce 20,000 barrels a day of a very, uh, competitive supply. Um, and, and so, we're, we're really excited this project, um, you know, uh, driven by kind of the overall benefits it'll bring to, uh, to Canada in, in achieving, uh, you know, achieving our, um, you know, total emissions objectives of net zero by 2050. This, this is a key contributor to reducing scope three emissions. So, so more to come inaudible. Perfect. And again, um, keeping on the line of emission reductions, you and others have obviously committed to carbon capture and sequestration. It was a big project kind of, which was announced. But like, how is it progressing? How are the partner commitments? What are you looking from the government in terms of help? I mean, it's, it's an excellent project, but we don't get too many details on that carbon cap sequestration project. So if you could just help us understand how the discussions are progressing between you and all the others and the government for that project. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'm excited to talk about it. Um, we're, we're, we're making, I think, really, really good progress. Um, you know, this is a very complex undertaking, uh, to achieve net zero by 2050. Uh, and, and the Alliance we've established, uh, amongst the member companies is unprecedented, the level of, of cooperation. The amount of investment that will ultimately be required to get to net zero, you know, we've, we've estimated as, as $75 billion, uh, from now to 2050. So, you know, it's a huge undertaking. It's not just one, um, single project, it's multiple projects. Um, there, there's a foundational project, which is building this large trunk line that will allow the transport of carbon, uh, that's captured in the Fort McMurray area all the way down to the cold lake region, uh, where we've applied with the government for access to poor space so we can, um, so we can sequester the, the carbon there. Um, so, you know, building this large trunk line is, is a significant project. But then there's several other projects around the capture site at each of the individual sites. So where we're, you know, producing, uh, hydrocarbons today. Uh, um, and then on top of that, um, you know, as I just talked at, at Cold Lake, you know, not only are we focused on, um, capturing carbon and transporting it to a site to, to store it, but we're also looking at how can we fundamentally reduce the amount of carbon that's generated? And so, things like solvent technologies are quite important there. So a lot of moving pieces, uh, if, if you will, to, uh, to progress this project. But, you know, we, as, as an Alliance, uh, have been able to develop, uh, preliminary plans around, uh, kind of the sequence of the trunk line project, the, the carbon capture projects as well as other technology initiatives. Um, you know, we, we will talk more about that on Investor Day, uh, but I think it's moving quite well. We are also, uh, spending a lot of time with both the federal and provincial government around enabling steps that are necessary to progress these huge investments. You know, specifically we are looking for investment tax credit and other, uh, financial support from the government, uh, given the nature of these investments, the, the risks associated with them. So, so those discussions are, are ongoing. Um, the, the cooperation amongst the companies is just exceptional. Um, you know, in, in fact, as, as CEOs, uh, the six companies, we, we get together every single week and, and are having, uh, discussions about the progress of the project, key priorities. How do we keep it moving along? You know, what are some of the key issues? And again, as I mentioned, we're also actively, uh, engaged with, with the government. So as CEOs, we're, we're meeting directly with key officials, and certainly, our, our teams are meeting, uh, with, with officials and staffs as well, led, at both the federal, the provincial level. So, you know, it's all hands on deck. Um, this is a huge challenge, but we think it's achievable and we think it's necessary. And so, we're, we're gonna do what it takes. That is, that is great inaudible and, uh, hoping to meet you at an in-person, uh, Investor Day in March. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I, I look forward to meeting you as, as well. You know, unfortunately, uh, the, the Corona Virus has, uh, has continued to, to delay many in-person meetings, but, um, you know, as soon as, as soon as the opportunity, uh, affords itself, I very much look forward to it as well. It's been, it's been a long two years, right? So, uh- Right. So, so again, I look forward to meeting you as well. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be on your call. Thanks for taking my questions. Um, Brad, I, I wonder if I could start with, uh, Exxon Mobil's announcement yesterday of combining their downstreaming chemicals business. I wonder if there's any readthrough for Imperial as it relates to incremental cost cutting initiatives, or whether you follow suit. Yeah, thanks for the question, Doug. And it's, it's, it's good, good to hear your voice. It's been a while since we've connected. So, uh, so thanks for joining the call today. Um, you know, regarding Exxon Mobil's announcements yesterday, um, super, super exciting news, um, you know, for, for Exxon Mobil, and, you know, with Exxon Mobil being, uh, majority shareholder of Imperial, we benefit, uh, from that relationship in many ways. Um, you know, we, we often talk about, uh, the, the technology, uh, benefits that we're able to leverage, kind of their global best practices, some, some operational synergies. And, and I think all of that comes to play, uh, with the announcement that was made yesterday. Um, you know, we're, we still have a lot of work to do to fully understand their plans, and then see how we can best leverage them and adapt them. But I, I fully expect, um, that we will within Imperial see benefits, uh, from, you know, their announcements to strategies that, that they're progressing. And like I said, we're, we're super excited. Okay, thank you for that. My, my follow up is I, I don't wanna get ahead of myself here for your upcoming analyst day. It, it seems Exxon has also decided to go virtual and unfortunately, so I dunno what you ultimately decide, but, um, but my question is specifically on Kearl. Wh- when you lead out the kinda reliability trajectory, um, towards 2025, um, it seems that you are well on your way to that. You're probably a little bit ahead of the pace, I would guess. Is there any, any thoughts you could, you could provide in terms of the timing or the scale of what you ultimately see Kearl doing on that original timeline? I'll leave it there, thanks. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that question, and you're right. You know, it is, is an unfortunate some of the, the impacts that, uh, that COVID has had on, uh, on plans for Investor Day, you know, it impacted us last year, has the risk of impacting us this year, but, you know, we're, we're committed to, uh, to engaging, uh, you know, with our investors, our analysts, and sharing our, our forward plans. I think it's a very, it's a very positive story. Um, you know, and, and in terms of Kearl, you're, you're exactly right. You know, each year, uh, over the last couple years, we, we continue to set new records at Kearl, and, uh, you know, and so, as I mentioned, you know, we just completed 2021 with, uh, 263,000 barrels a day, um, gross. Um, our guidance for next year is 265 to 270, um, which again, moves us one step closer to, to 280, which as, as, as you accurately note, we previously indicated that, that we would get to 280 in that 2025… that we would get to 280 in that 2025 timeframe, but we are well ahead of that. Um, and, and that Investor Day, you know, will lay out kind of a revised plan. But, but, but safe to say, it's, you know, there's a lot of organizational focus on how we can get to that 280,000 level sooner than, than 2025. Um, and, and so, you know, some of the things we, we've already done that will contribute are things like, uh, moving to one turnaround per year, which we achieved a year earlier than, than what we shared at last Investor Day. Um, we have multiple debottlenecking projects, uh, that, that we're progressing. We're continuing to look at how do we optimize, um, you know, ore recovery and, uh, and movement, uh, in, in the mines. And, and then, you know, uh, taking full advantage of, of digital. Um, you know, I've talked on, on prior calls about how we're employing multiple, um, digital techniques that are adding real value to us. And, you know, that will also have beneficial effects on our production rates. So, you know, I, I still, I, I think 265 to 270 is, is, is appropriate for 2022. Um, but, but you can see that's gonna step us to 280 quicker than, than the 2025 timeframe. Um, and, and will, you know, Simon, at Investor Day, will give a lot more detail about those individual projects. Um, thanks for the full answer. Guys will look forward to it. Thanks again. Thanks, Do- Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Pardy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Yeah, thanks. Good morning. And thanks to the rundown, is, is always very thorough. Um, again at the risk of probably jumping ahead, but, but, uh, uh, Brad, you've mentioned, you know, that there are steps you're taking to strengthen the downstream business. I'm just wondering if, if there are any things you can kinda share and whether the, um, you know, like I'm assuming the products pipeline, you know, fix into that mix, but any color there would be great. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Greg. And, and, and you're right. We'll, we'll give a much more comprehensive story, um, at, uh, at Investor Day. But you know, it, it, it starts fundamentally with our cost structure. And as I mentioned, we've done a lot of things, uh, ar- around our cost structure. Um, and, and I feel really good a- about that. And then it's, it, it's ensuring that we are leveraging, um, you know, all the synergy that we have, uh, based on our, our location of our three refineries, um, the integration that they have between themself, but that they also have, um, with our upstream production assets. Um, and then, you know, ensuring that we maximize the flexibility of their run slate, you know, which has been key through the pandemic as we've had to adjust to much lower jet demand, uh, and move that into other, other products. Um, and then look at where we have an opportunity to, to grow new, uh, product outlets. Um, you know, we've talked about things we've done with asphalt, uh, over the last couple of years and how that's, you know, an increasing part of our portfolio. And again, leverage is on our, on our, our heavy crude slate. Um, and then, you know, most recently, of course, you know, the, the shred project and our ability to, to generate, uh, you know, renewable diesel at Strathcona will be a key, um, strategic undertaking for us. Um, and then of course, uh, you know, the integration we have between, uh, Sarnia refinery and Sarnia chemical plant also allows us to, um, you know, further capture market and value. And, uh, so again, you know, that, that's kind of a broad brush on it. Uh, you know, John Wetmore, uh, will, will give of a much more comprehensive story at, uh, at Investor Day, but, uh, but exciting opportunities for us, uh, in the downstream. Okay. No, terrific. And, and maybe now, uh, it's probably more of a question for Dan, but I mean, just as an observation, and we've been talking about a SIV for a long time. Um, but, and I totally understand where you guys are coming from in terms of evaluation. But, but maybe Dan specifically, uh, would it be possible for you to just frame what the mechanics are? Like, I've never worked through one of these, uh, from that standpoint. And, and is it possible just to, again, enlighten us in terms of black ore. It's like, I'm not trying to pin you down on a date per se, because you're sorta saying within the June timeframe, but I just, I think I'd love to know what, what needs to go into this in terms of formalizing your decision process. Yeah. I mean, technically, the technicalities o- o- of an SIV, I mean, it requires a filing, it's, it's open for 35 days. Generally speaking, y- y- you shouldn't do it duri- during a blackout period, which, which is typically sort of 30 days before your earnings release, y- you know, ballpark is on the blackout periods are. So that, that's, that's sort of the, um, the, the timing and technicalities of it. Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks, Greg. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Thanks so much. Uh, Brad, and one of the core competencies that you've had, and you brought into the business is, is your background around M&A given, uh, your prior role at, at Exxon. And just to be curious on your own perspective of, of give you Imperial as a logical consolidator, especially in light of the deferred tax, uh, position and, and, uh, your success of turning around operations and, and, uh, and scale and cost of capital. And it, uh, and if so, how do you think about balancing that versus return of capital? So big picture question, but any thoughts would be, uh, appreciated. Yeah. Thanks, Neil. And, and good to hear from you. Um, you know, as we've said in the past, um, we continue to keep an open mind, an open aperture around potential, uh, M&A opportunities. Um, it's, it's not our top priority. Our top priority, uh, centers around our existing asset base, um, and maximizing value from those assets, which I, I think we, we have demonstrated, uh, success over, over the last couple years. And, and has us well positioned for the future with, you know, some very long life assets that, um, you know, under, under favorable markets will continue to generate significant cash. And, uh, so when we look at potential M&A opportunities, we, we need to convince ourself that not only do they fit into a long term strategy, but, but they are a creative. And, and they do compete for capital relative to, um, you know, the, the, the brownfield investments that, that we already have identified and, and are progressing. Um, you know, we're, we're not, uh, driven to acquire something just to grow for the sake of growing. In fact, you know, I think we've demonstrated our ability to grow with the existing asset base. Um, y- you know, take Kearl for example. Um, you know, it was just, just a couple years ago that, that we were at, or below 200,000 barrels a day. And so, you know, now this year, we are at 263, we expect to grow that to 265 to 270. And, and within a relatively short timeframe, you know, I expect we'll be at, at 280 or, or higher. And so in a few short years, we, we will have added 80,000 barrels a day of growth in our portfolio at a cost much, much lower than, you know, any acquisition we, we could have contemplated. So that will continue to be the, the priority as, you know, making sure we first focus on our existing assets. But, you know, there is a lot of consolidation occurring and, uh, and, you know, we, we wanna make sure we are making thoughtful decisions. And so, you know, we, we look at, uh, potential acquisitions and evaluate them, and we discuss them as a management team. And, um, and, and, you know, that guides us accordingly. Um, so, so hope that answered your question. Uh, that is a helpful framework, Brad. And the follow up is just around cash taxes. Can you just remind us, uh, team how you, how you're thinking about your deferred tax position? But good problem to have, to have a lot of earnings per share. Um, but I would imagine that would also, uh, take, create some considerations that we need to, uh, embed in the model going forward. Yeah, a- absolutely. Dan and his team spend a lot of time thinking about that. And so I'll, I'll ask him to answer. Yeah, well, uh, you know, just for the record, we're against cash taxes, um, if you didn't know our position. But, <laugh> uh, we, you know, we don't expect… Well, in 2021, uh, actual, actual cash taxes will be, you know, quite small. 2022 will be sort of a transition year. And by 2023, you know, a current, you know, with current, you know, economic conditions, we'd expect to be, to be fully tax paying. So, you know, I think that's probably as much as I, I can tell you. But, um, well, on a, on a pure cash basis out the door, um, we should pay, uh, less than the statutory rate in, in 2022. But by 2023, you know, we'll be full- fully tax paying on, on a cash basis. That's kinda where we are. Makes sense, Dan. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mena Hosa with T. D. Security. You may proceed with your question. Uh, good morning, everyone. And, uh, thanks for, uh, squeezing me in. Uh, m- most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I'll just, uh, surround things out with cost inflation. We have a pretty good sense of what that could look like for upstream across the, the industry, but what are, what are you seeing in terms of cost pressures for downstream? And would you be able to provide, uh, separate ranges for the two? Yeah, thanks for the question. And, and no doubt that is a, uh, is, is an emerging theme, you know, a- across industry and, and, and more broadly, society right now with inflationary pressures from, from lots of angles. You know, I, I think, um, you know, fortunately, uh, for us, uh, we, we haven't seen huge impacts of, of inflationary pressures yet. Um, but that's not to say we, we won't going forward. You know, probably the single largest, uh, impact we've had i- i- is around our own energy costs. Um, you know, where, where we, we, we purchase natural gas, um, you know, for, for our facilities. Um, and, and obviously, you know, we all know what's happened there, but, you know, as, uh, as, as somebody who also produces, uh, energy, you know, unbalanced, that's, that's still favorable for us. Um, you know, we're, we're taking a close look at other consumable supplies and things like that. And, you know, first making sure we, we, we have access to the supplies and we're not impacted by any market shortages. Um, but then also looking at, you know, how we can optimize the, the cost and, and mitigate any, any cost pressures. Um, you know, where we could see, you know, more significant impacts would be things like, um, you know, steel for example. But the good news is, you know, when, when we look at, um, our large projects, um, you know, for, for next year, you know, we talk about Sarnia products, pipeline, you know, that project is essentially complete steel bought, you know, a, a long time ago. Um, the Kearl in pit tailings project is, you know, had some steel associated with it, again, most of which has already been, been procured. But it's more of a, um, you know, earth moving project, uh, than, than anything, um, very labor intensive. And so we gotta keep an eye on labor costs, but, but again, so far, we, we haven't seen huge impacts there. So, something we're gonna keep a very close eye on going forward, um, but, but so far we've, we've been able to manage it quite well. Thanks, Brad. I'll leave it there. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Uh, yes. Hi, good morning. Um, my first question's on the, on the dividend, obviously, as you noted two very large increases, uh, in the past two years since the last time, uh, you had an Analyst Day. Um, and you had talked about, you know, a certain breakeven level, uh, at that time. So I, I, I was just wondering if you could refresh us on how you think about what that breakeven would be today. And then as you go forward, um, how think about sustainable levels, increases in the dividend, um, with respect to, you know, a breakeven framework or however else you might look at it. Thanks for the to- for the question. I think D- Dan will give an, an answer on that. Yeah. Hey, Phil, we, we'll talk more about breakevens a- at the Analyst Day. I mean, last year, we, we talked about, um, um, uh, you know, 36 bucks with, um, you know, uh, both including, uh, sustaining capital a- and dividend. I think that, that's still, still a good number, so we're, we're pretty far away, away from that. So it is important to us, obviously that <laugh> we, the dividend is, uh, s- sustainable and growing dividend is, is our, is our core kind of, one of our core investor, uh, offerings. And, and we do think about that. And we, and we feel given, given our outlook, that, that, that the seven cents is, is warranted, and we feel quite good about it, uh, going forward. Um, so I guess it's probably much as, much as I, I'll say, but, you know, our breakeven is, is well below current prices. So, um, that gives us a lot of comfort. And obviously as we go forward, we continue to, you know, we've had energy inflation as has been discussed, um, but we continue to work on our base cost structure. Um, so, you know, obviously, we wanna get that breakeven down a- as low, as low as we can. Uh, understood. Okay. Thank you. Um, and then just one other question on, um, the OPEX in the quarter, obviously, it was up sequentially. Um, I wasn't sure if some of the one-time costs that you called out in any way, um, flow through OPEX or not, but just in general, um, you know, latest OPEX in ' 22. Yeah. Of that, you know, 160 million, there, there's a lot of things in there. There's, there's deferred tax adjustments, there, there's life phone inventory changes, but there's, there's, there's also, I'd say $60 million of OPEX in the upstream included in that number. So, yeah, part, part of that's, uh, uh, part, part of that 160 is one-time OPEX from some smaller write-downs of, o- o- of, of a number of things. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks Phil. Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Hughes for any further remarks. All right. Well, thank you very much and thank you everybody for, uh, joining us this morning. As, as usual, if you have any further questions, uh, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at any time. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you'll need to press star one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Hughes, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll start by introducing uh you to the management team we have in attendance. Uh Brad Corson, Chairman, President and CEO, Dan Lyons, Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration, Simon Younger, Senior Vice President of the Upstream, Sherry Evers, Vice President of Commercial and Corporate Development, and John Wetmore, Vice President of the Downstream. So I'll quickly go over the cautionary statement. Today's comments include reference to non-GAP financial measures, the definitions and reconciliations of these measures can be found in attachment six of our most recent press release and are available on our website with the link to this conference call. And any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance, and actual future financial performance and operating results can differ materially depending on a number of factors and assumptions. Forward-looking information and the risk factors and assumptions are described in further detail in our fourth quarter earnings press release that we issued this morning, as well as our most recent Form 10K. And all of these documents are available on CEDAR, Edgar, and on our website. So I'd ask you to please refer to those. So just before I turn it over to Brad for his opening remarks, once he's done and and he and Dan go over our financial and operating performance for the quarter, we will be moving to the Q and A session as usual. So with that I'll turn it over to Brad. Good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope each of you are doing well and are in good health to start the new year. As we bring 2021 to a close, well at least from a reporting point of view, I would like to repeat something I said on the third quarter call. Wow, what a difference a year makes. I'm very pleased to report that we finished the year strong with another quarter of solid operating performance and strong financial results. In twenty twenty, we focused heavily on ensuring Imperial was well positioned to take advantage of the market recovery through ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure, improving our reliability, and progressing high return brownfield projects. And you can now see the benefits of those efforts in our twenty twenty one results, as we continued to make the most of the improving and attractive business environment. This performance was reflected in all business lines, although we did see some pretty challenging weather to close out the year. And as it has all year, this performance allowed us to return a material amount of cash to shareholders in the quarter. And in fact, to accelerate the pace of these returns, resulting in around $3 billion for the full year, the highest level in the company's history. Throughout 2021, we continued to manage the ongoing challenges due to COVID-19. Our focus on maintaining the health and safety of our workforce was key, not only in minimizing disruptions to our operations, but also and most importantly in ensuring the well being of our people. From a business perspective, we saw continued demand recovery throughout the year and significant improvement in commodity prices, both of which are reflected in our results. Over the next few minutes, Dan and I will detail the results of what was a very strong quarter. So now let's turn more specifically to the fourth quarter results. Earnings for the fourth quarter were eight hundred and thirteen million dollars, and our cash from operating activities was over one point six billion dollars, both somewhat lower versus the third quarter. Earnings were negatively impacted by approximately one hundred sixty million dollars in one time non cash events. And cash flow excluding working capital effects was up more than $100 million, reflecting our strong operating performance and the strong commodity fundamentals in the quarter. Crude prices continue to strengthen through the quarter while both downstream and chemical margins remained strong. Our upstream continued to perform very well, delivering its highest annual And our downstream performed well also. We saw utilization of ninety-seven percent for the quarter and higher product sales as demand continued to recover. Our chemical business closed out the year with another strong quarter and delivered the highest full year earnings in over 30 years. As expected, polyethylene margins did soften somewhat in the quarter, but remained strong and supported the best ever full year earnings for this business. So in total, our strong cash flow generation in a period of strong commodity prices was underpinned by continued strong operational performance. We were able to take advantage of attractive markets for crude, refined products and chemicals. And all of this contributes to a very strong cash position which continues to allow us to deliver on our priority of returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter we, returned $950 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and accelerated share buybacks. For the year, we generated about $5.5 billion doll ofars cash from operating activities and around four point five billion dollars of free cash flow. And we put this cash to good use. Early in the year we announced the largest quarterly dividend in the company's history and reinstituted our share buyback program, which we suspended in 2020 due to the business environment brought on by the pandemic. And in the fourth quarter, we announced an acceleration of the renewed NCIB. All of this resulted in the return of nearly three billion dollars of cash to our shareholders in the year. 2021 marks the twenty-seventh consecutive year of dividend increases. And you would have seen us continue this trend with the announcement this morning of another significant dividend increase of seven cents per share, which is around twenty six percent, our largest dividend increase in history. This equates to a fifty five percent increase since the beginning of 2021 and represents an increase of almost 80% since the beginning of 2019. Going forward, following yesterday's completion of our accelerated NCIB and today's announcement of a sizable dividend increase, we remain committed to returning surplus cash to shareholders and are actively evaluating our next steps in this area, including a potential substantial issuer bid. We are unwavering in our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and delivering further shareholder value and returns. I'll now turn it over to Dan to go through our financial performance for the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Brad. Getting into the financial results for the full year, we recorded net income of almost two and a half billion dollars, an increase of around three point two billion dollars, excluding the one-time one point two billion dollar non-cash impairment charge related to our unconventional business that we recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of twenty twenty one, our net income was eight hundred and thirteen million dollars. Excluding identified items, net income increased almost eight hundred million dollars from the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by stronger realizations in the upstream and improved margins in the downstream and chemicals. Now, if we look sequentially, our fourth quarter income of $813 million is down, about $95 million from the third quarter of this year. As Brad noted, the fourth quarter results include a number of unrelated one-time, non-CAS charges totaling about $160 million. Looking at each business line, the upstream recorded net income of $545 million up $20 million from our third quarter net income of five hundred and twenty four million dollars as a result of higher realizations and volumes, partly offset by higher operating expenses, driven in part by mine progress spend at curl and higher energy costs. Upstream results included a number of one time charges of about eighty five million dollars. The downstream recorded net income of two hundred and fifty million dollars down $43 million from net income of $293 million in the third quarter. Downstream results included a number of one-time charges totaling around $75 million. Chemicals continue to demonstrate strong performance in the fourth quarter with net income of sixty-four million dollars, down about sixty million dollars from the third quarter of this year as polyethylene prices moderated from the extremely extremely strong levels seen in the third quarter. Moving on to cash flow, in the fourth quarter, we generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operating activities, imp anrovement of about $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020. Our free cash flow for the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Looking at the full year, our strong results in capital discipline deliver free cash flow of almost four and a half billion dollars. As we start 2022, strong commodity prices, along with our continued cost and capital discipline, position us well to generate very substantial free cash flow going forward. Moving on to CapEx, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $441 million, up from $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Full year capital expenditures were in line with revised guidance at just over $1.1 billion. Capital spending in 2021 was focused on progressing key projects such as curlit tailings infrastructure and the Sarnia products pipeline. We also continue to invest in improving volumes through projects like the Solvent Assisted Laser Project at our Makesis Cold Lake plant and improving the efficiency and cost structure of our operations by continuing to invest in projects like our autonomous haul truck fleet and related infrastructure, as well as installing our first boiler flue gas heat recovery unit at Curl. In December, we announced our 2022 capital guidance at $1.4 billion, reflecting our strong ongoing capital discipline. In the upstream at Curl, capital spending includes the ramp up of the Curl Inpit Tailings Project, ongoing investment in our autonomous truck fleet, and installing additional boiler flue gas heat recovery units. At Cold Lake, we will work on developing phase one of our Grand Rapids project, continue to progress solvent assisted laser, as well as infill drilling and well work. And the downstream spending includes the completion and commissioning of the Sarnia products pipeline and spending on the Stratona Renewable Diesel Project. We will have an opportunity to discuss these plans in more detail at our investor day. Shifting to shareholder distributions. As I mentioned earlier, we generated about four and a half billion dollars of free cash flow in twenty twenty one. This performance supported record returns of almost three billion dollars of cash to shareholders, including returns of about nine hundred and fifty million dollars in the fourth quarter alone. We repurchased seventeen and a half million shares for seven hundred and sixty-one million dollars in the quarter under an accelerated program, bringing our full year buyback to fifty six million shares for over two point two billion dollars. We pay dividends of one hundred eighty eight million in the fourth quarter and a total of over $700 million for the full year. Despite these record distributions, we ended the year with about two point two billion dollars of cash on hand. Consistent with our previous announcement, we continued our accelerated NCIB purchases in January 2022 and completed this program on January thirty first. We also declared an increased dividend of thirty-four cents per share payable on April one. Furthermore, as Brad mentioned, in light of our current cash balance and the strong business outlook, we are actively evaluating options for additional shareholder returns, including a potential substantial issuer bid. Now I'll turn it back to Brad to discuss our operational performance. Thanks, Dan. As we switch our focused operations, I would sum up the fourth quarter as being another strong quarter operationally across all business lines. In the upstream, we averaged four hundred and forty five thousand oil equivalent barrels per day, which is an increase of ten thousand barrels per day versus the third quarter, but is down fifteen thousand barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. This decrease year on year was due mainly to an early start to winter. In fact, Alberta saw several weeks of extreme Arctic temperatures in the last half of December and early January, which as you know presents some operational challenges, particularly in our mining operations. At our Investor Day in late twenty twenty, we communicated our intent to focus the upstream organization's efforts on maximizing the performance of our existing asset base. And given how the assets performed in twenty twenty one, I would say we are on that strategy and achieving it and it's also paying off for us. In fact, our full year twenty twenty-one production was four hundred and twenty-eight thousand oil equivalent barrels per day, which is the highest in over thirty years and exceeded our guidance for the year. I would also note the current market environment and the strong commodity prices we are seeing. While in the fourth quarter there were a number of factors which drove the WTI WCS spreads wider, such as the phase start up of line three and other smaller disruptions, we are now seeing narrower spreads and are well positioned to continue to benefit from this. So now let's move on and talk about curl. Production at curl in the fourth quarter averaged two hundred and seventy thousand barrels per day gross, which was down four thousand barrels per day versus the third quarter, and fourteen thousand barrels per day lower than the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. As I mentioned, Western Canada saw an early start to winter, feeling the effects of a deep freeze that started late in the fourth quarter and extended into the new year. And as we have talked about in the past, extended periods of extreme cold weather can be challenging for our operations, and particularly mining. The result of these weather challenges was lower than expected production in the fourth quarter at Curl, with an estimated impact of around thirteen thousand barrels per day in the quarter, or just over three thousand barrels per day on a full-year basis. The impacts of the extreme cold weather continued to linger into January, but I'm pleased to say that as of now our operations have essentially returned to normal. I would also like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous dedication of our workforce, whose efforts to safely maintain our operations in these extreme conditions and mitigate the production impacts are a huge credit to the organization. Despite the weather impacts, total full year production for curl was two hundred and sixty three thousand barrels per day, the highest in the asset's history. This compares to two hundred and twenty-two thousand barrels per day in twenty twenty, an increase of forty-one thousand barrels per day for the year. And its curl continues to deliver on its production and reliability commitments, including the elimination of the second annual turnaround, a full year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we continue to be excited about Curl's potential as we make progress on our accelerated journey to two hundred and eighty thousand barrels per day. And despite the slower start to the year, we reiterate our 2022 guidance of 265 to 270,000 barrels per day, reflecting the next step in production growth at the site. I would also note that this 2022 guidance reflects one major planned turnaround expected to be executed in the second quarter of the year. I'd like to wrap up our discussion about curl with some comments about unit costs, another positive reflection of the asset's performance. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, continued pressure from higher energy prices and the strength of the Canadian dollar presented some challenges in meeting our unit cash cost target of US twenty dollars per barrel. In 2021, higher energy costs and the strength of the Canadian dollar represented approximately an incremental two dollars and fifty cents per barrel relative to twenty twenty. However, if we normalize for energy costs in Forex, both items outside our control, our unit cost would have achieved a reduction of almost one dollar per barrel from 2020 and been below the target of US twenty dollars per barrel. Close management of unit costs continues to be core to our approach to maximizing profitability at Curl, and we remain focused on achieving further unit cost reductions as we go forward. So now let's talk about Cold Lake. Cold Lake has been a really positive story throughout 2021. Production for the quarter averaged 142,000 barrels per day, which was up 7,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter, and 6,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. This strong performance reflects the benefits of our continued focus on production optimization and reliability. And while Cold Lake experienced the same stream same extreme cold temperatures in December, it did not have a material impact given the nature of this operation. For the year, production averaged one hundred forty thousand barrels per day, exceeding our updated guidance of one hundred and thirty five thousand barrels per day. Our full year production at Cold Lake was driven by significant improvement to the base performance, highlighting the effectiveness of our strategy to focus on reliability and optimization. We also saw the benefits from recent drilling investments in our operations, which contributed almost two thousand barrels per day of production for the year. We are looking forward to continuing to benefit from these improvements in the coming year. And for 2022, we have issued guidance of 135,000 to 140,000 barrels per day for Cold Lake, which includes a typical plant turnaround in the second quarter. Now at Sincrude, Imperial's share of production for the quarter averaged 79,000 barrels per day, which was up slightly from seventy-eight thousand barrels per day in the third third quarter, but down eight thousand barrels per day from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty. Unplanned downtime coupled with extreme cold weather presented challenges for these operations in December, as detailed in the statement issued by the operator Suncor earlier in January. We estimate the impact to be close to five thousand barrels per day our share in the quarter. Imperial share of full year production averaged seventy one thousand barrels per day, an increase of two thousand barrels per day versus 202.0 As the ownership continues its focus on improving asset reliability, we reiterate our guidance for 2022 of 75 to 80,000 barrels per day. This guidance reflects the impacts of planned maintenance in the second quarter and a major coker turnaround in the third quarter. 2021 also marked a change in the operating structure at Syncrude and we remain confident that this change will better support the continued focus on improved reliability and cost performance for this asset. Moving to the downstream, we refined an average of four hundred and sixteen thousand barrels per day in the fourth quarter, which was up twelve thousand barrels a day versus the third quarter of twenty twenty one, and up fifty-seven thousand barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting the strong operating performance and the continuation of demand recovery we have seen throughout 2021. The fourth quarter throughput equates to a utilization of 97%, which is the highest fourth quarter utilization in over thirty years. This represents a 3% increase over the third quarter, bringing our full year utilization to eighty nine percent, which is right on the guidance we provided for twenty twenty one. And for the year, throughput was three hundred and seventy nine thousand barrels per day, up thirty nine thousand barrels per day versus twenty twenty. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, we have a fairly light turnaround year planned, supporting our increased guidance for twenty twenty two of ninety-two to ninety-four percent utilization. Looking at cash operating costs, our downstream business continues to do an exceptional job in managing its operating costs. Four-year cash operating costs were down $70 million compared to 2020, and down even more when normalizing for the rising energy prices we saw in 2021. This decrease is especially notable because over the same period our refining throughput increased by 39,000 barrels per day and our petroleum product sales grew by 35,000 barrels per day. So we are refining more barrels and selling more product, and we're doing it at a lower absolute cost. And again, this was a year of significant turnaround activity and higher energy costs. Petroleum product sales in the fourth quarter were 496,000 barrels per day, up 11,000 barrels per day from the third quarter on continued strong demands and up eighty thousand barrels per day from the fourth quarter of twenty twenty, reflecting significant recovery from the pandemic related softness of twenty twenty. We continue to see industry demand trends pretty consistent with what we saw through twenty twenty one. With gasoline and diesel demands hovering around 90 to 95 percent of historical levels, and jet continuing to improve, averaging around 70 to 75 percent. However, as mentioned, JET continues to be somewhat volatile as we experience subsequent waves of COVID nineteen and the associated restrictions related to travel. Also of note is that our jet sales volumes continue to track about 10% ahead of industry, predominantly related to competitive gains we were able to capture in 2021, increasing our overall market share. And with respect to downstream margins, unlike crude prices, our fourth quarter crack spreads continue to hover around the middle of the five year band, which reflects fairly steady improvement over early twenty twenty at the onset of the pandemic. And despite ongoing demand volatility, our continued focus on reliable and efficient operations ensures we are capturing as much value as possible in the current downstream pricing environment. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, the outlook is positive as we continue to see improvements in the market environment, driving further strengthening of our downstream business, which supports our continued journey back to typical earnings and cash flows for this business segment. And I'll wrap up our operating results with chemicals twenty  tw2enty one0.21 was an incredible year for this key part of our business, and I just can't say enough about how pleased I am with the performance it delivered, making the most of capturing a very favorable market environment. The fourth quarter was another solid quarter. Earnings in the fourth quarter were sixty-four million dollars, supported by continued strong production, reliability, and margins. Fourth quarter earnings were down fifty-seven million versus a third quarter, which I will will remind you was the highest quarterly earnings in over thirty years. This reduction was driven largely by expected softening of polyethylene margins. And while margins did soften somewhat in the quarter, they still remain quite strong, and that sets the chemical business up well for a strong twenty twenty two. Full year chemical earnings were three hundred sixty one million dollars, seventy four million higher than the previous full year record of two hundred eighty seven million dollars set in twenty fifteen. An outstanding year for our chemical business, which continues to be a differentiator for us. The integrated nature of our business supports a long history of profitability, even in a year like twenty twenty. And we expect this to continue even as we see polyethylene prices normalizing somewhat. And just before wrapping up, I wanted to highlight a couple of other important items of note. First, we announced our plans to market our interest in XTO Energy Canada a few weeks ago, which of as you will recall is our unconventional business. We have been quite open recently about where this business fits into our longer-term upstream strategy, and our decision to market the assets is fully consistent with this. To be clear though, no decision has been made to sell these assets, but in our view we felt it was appropriate to test the market in the event there is an opportunity to generate increased value through a potential sales transaction. I also wanted to highlight the announcements we made recently on Imperial's plans for further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions intensity over the next decade to help support Canada's net zero goals. Imperial has set a twenty thirty goal to reduce scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our operated oil sands facilities by thirty percent compared with twenty sixteen levels. This target builds on our previous twenty twenty three commitment, which we are well on track to deliver. I'm quite proud of the progress we made to date in reducing the intensity of our greenhouse gas emissions at our operated oil sands assets. And our recent announcement is another step in our journey to net zero at our operated oil sands assets by twenty fifty. So in closing, another strong quarter, which brings to a close a year of very strong results, both operationally and financially. As you have heard me say before, the decisions we have made and the work the organization has done over the past several quarters is allowing us to take maximum advantage of the prevailing market conditions. And this performance supports our ongoing commitment to drive increased shareholder value and our continued commitment to shareholder returns. As you heard Dan and I mentioned, in twenty twenty one we returned nearly three billion dollars to our shareholders via our reliable and growing dividend and share buybacks. And we are also excited to reinforce our commitments to sustainability, not only with our recent announced greenhouse gas intensity reduction target, but with our participation in the Pathways Initiative, an unprecedented industry alliance. Our long term focus on reducing our environmental footprint through investments in things like solvent technologies and carbon capture and storage underpin our confidence in meeting these goals. Looking forward to twenty twenty two, we continue to see support for commodity prices and fully expect to deliver another year of strong operational performance, underpinning our ability to take utmost advantage of the current market conditions. We will continue our focus on reduced emissions and sustainability, including our plans for renewable diesel at our Strathcona refinery. We will remain disciplined with respect to spending levels, both operating and capital. And we will also continue to return cash in excess of these needs to our shareholders. And finally, I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support. I hope you're as excited about twenty twenty two as we are. Thank you and back to you Dave. Okay, we're gonna move to the QA now. We did have a couple of uh questions pre-submitted, which we'll get to first, and then we'll go to the live QA line. So the two questions came from Phil Skullnick at 8 Capital. The first one, what are you in ExxonMobil looking for in order to make a decision on marketing the XTO assets? Would you consider selling it in pieces? Yeah, thanks for that question, Phil. Um in January our intention to market those assets jointly with with ExxonMobil. Uh and in fact we've we've progressed those activities now, have the data room open. There there is a lot of interest. And you know, our our decision around marketing was really driven by the strategic work we have done over the last couple of years where we have prioritized our focus on certain assets and our portfolio and uh and and really prioritized our capital as well. And and through that work we we have concluded that we have uh higher value opportunities uh with our with our core mining uh assets. And as such, um you know, you'll recall we took an an impairment decision in in late 2020 uh for some of the unconventional assets that we had um not included in our development plans. So again, this is really um a continuation of of that strategy. We have not made the decision to sell though, so we're going to be looking at you know how do we create maximum value for for us, for our shareholders. Um prior to uh to putting the the assets in the marketplace, we had received uh several unsolicited offers uh for for those assets, um, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. Um, you know, there's been a lot of consolidation that's occurring i in the in the Motney and Duvernay shale uh resource plays and uh you know so it's really the the culmination of all that that uh that drove us to put those assets in the marketplace and uh and and we'll see what we get back. Um we it is a very large resource uh play, um you know, over six hundred and fifty thousand net acres. Um and and so from a uh you know from a a a transaction structure we we are open to uh to selling it in pieces. Um you know we d we do know that there are some industry players that are primarily focused in the Motany. There's others that are primarily focused in the Duvernay. There's some that are in both. So, you know, we we are open to considering uh alternate uh structures for the transaction. Um the key is going to be what delivers the most value and and how does that compare to our view of value if we were to continue to uh to retain the asset and and develop it further ourselves. So uh so we're we're excited to see uh what comes out of the data room and and the bids um you know in another month or so. Thanks for that question. Okay and Phil's uh follow-up I think Dan I'll direct uh straight to you is are you still considering an SIB given the dividend increase? Yeah thanks Phil we talked about this uh you know in in our in our kind of prepared remarks uh but but it's probably worth um talking a little more. I mean the short answer is yes. We are we are considering an SIB and and just stepping back, you know, we we have a long standing philosophy, I think as you know, to return surplus cash to shareholders. You know, it starts with a reliable and growing dividend, which we've demonstrated over many years, and of course this morning's announcement of a sizable increase is is another step in in in that um in that direction. After you know dividends, our next vehicle for surplus cash is the NCIB. NCIB, it's simple, efficient, and flexible. Um we used it certainly to the max in in twenty twenty one. We had a a program we restarted in in May-uneJ. We we bought a bunch of shares. We launched a new program in June. We ended up accelerating that to wrap up early. Over the course of 2021, we repurchased over $2.2 billion through that program. And just uh you know, January 31st, yesterday we wrapped up that program with our acceleration through January 31st of another incremental $450 million dollars so over thirteen months about about two point seven billion dollars uh through the NCIB. But as you know as well, we're limited to five percent of outstanding shares annually in that program. Our next renewal would be late June uh of this year. We we certainly plan to to do that. Um but looking at our cash balances and our outlook, you know, for for for strong cash flow, um we're anticipating taking action on shareholder returns, additional action be before renewal of the NCIB in late June. We haven't made a final decision, but we've certainly heard the market's feedback, um strong preference uh for an SIB and and and that's our lead case at this point. Okay. Um operator, uh can we turn it over to you now, please, to go to the live QA line. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Our first question comes from Dennis Fong with CIBC World Market. You may proceed with your question. Hi, good morning and and thanks for taking my questions. Uh the first one maybe follows in line with uh Dan's comment there on um on returning cash back to shareholders. Obviously Imperial oil is in a enviable position with respect to leverage. Can you maybe describe what you view as the ideal capital structure for in your opinion for the company and how we should be thinking about that? Obviously balancing the available free cash flow that you're generating, the relative capex that you have already outlined with your twenty twenty two guidance, as well as uh the various other levers that you have in returning cash back to shareholders. Thanks. I'll I'll turn that question over to Dan. He can build on his comments about uh about shareholder returns. Yeah, look, you know, we we could uh we have about five billion dollars of debt which we've had for um you know uh, pretty been stable for for for a number of years. We we feel comfortable with that level of debt. You know, given our our leverage uh on an absolute basis and relative to peers is low. Um it's not it's not um our first move to repay the debt. So uh to the extent we have surplus cash um our are really you know once we've exhausted the N C I B it's it's use other mechanisms to to return that to shareholders. So um you know that's maybe a short answer, but I think I think that is um that it in a nutshell. And you see we have a fairly, as I mentioned in my remarks, a fairly modest uh capital program in twenty twenty two. And you know, at current price levels we we anticipate generating significant free cash flow in addition to you know a pretty significant cash balance uh right now. Great, great, thanks. And my second question here is uh more on the offside, so either maybe directed to you, Brad, or to Simon. Um just with respect to Cold Lake, you've obviously seen fairly strong um production levels uh and and a lot of success from the optimization side. You mentioned a little bit around a laser and the the utilization of solvents. Just curious as to how the optimization is is continuing, what maybe some of the next steps happen to be, and what does that potentially mean for a project like Grand Rapids, which was potentially going to ut utilize existing steam infrastructure in the area. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for that question, Dennis. You know, we we are super excited about the progress we're we're making at Cold Lake. Um, you know, we we have put a lot of focus into optimizing the the reservoir performance of of those assets. We've continued to focus on reliability as well. And then, you know, as as you mentioned and and we've commented on this call and in the past, um, you know, we continue to look for ways to employ um kind of next generation solvent technologies uh like laser that achieve multiple objectives for us. Um, you know they, they do have the benefit of enhancing reservoir performance, uh, but equally important they reduce the greenhouse gas emissions uh because they they have lower uh steam and energy intensity. And so, you know, it is a continued strategy of ours to continue to um to deploy uh solvent technologies to enhance Cold Lake's performance. Next on the docket is Grand Rapids Phase I which will uh employ SA SAG D technology. And then looking a little bit longer term, we were evaluating application of a cyclant solvent process. We refer to as CSP, which allows us to replace steam with propane and and achieve even further reductions in uh in greenhouse gas intensity while improving reservoir performance. And in the case of CSP, uh we've we've already piloted that uh quite successfully and and so now looking at the further application. So, you know, I think over over the the coming quarters and years, you're going to continue to hear us talk about the evolution of these technologies, how they're integral to both our reservoir optimization, but also our greenhouse greenhouse gas intensity reduction objectives and and I'm sure in our in our upcoming investor day we'll spend some more time talking about each of those and and how they fit in. Uh thanks thanks for the question and again we're we're very excited about uh about our actions at Cold Lake. Thank you. Um Hey guys, my first question is more on the on the renewable diesel side. I'm just trying to understand if you can give us um I'm sure you'd have some preliminary work. What kind of feed stocks are you looking to run? Soya bean, colo canola. I mean you are in that vegetable oil belt, so is it primarily going to be vegetable oils? Can you bring in some use cooking oil, uh some animal fats and so if you if if I could get some understanding of that. Yeah thanks thanks for that question and and again we're we're we're gonna spend some more time at investor day describing the this project, but kind of at at the the foundation of your question, fundamentally this is going to be plant based materials. Um we're we're we're not looking at um you know animal fat or or or other sorts of uh of supply. It's it's very much focused on um on plant based materials that are sourced generally in the region. You know, we haven't talked explicitly about the the specific type of plant. We're still in commercial discussions with potential suppliers. Um and and so those those uh commercial discussions are still sensitive around the type. Uh but but needless to say there's there's an abundant supply of of available materials and and good options for us that are going to allow us to uh you know ultimately produce 20,000 barrels a day of of very uh competitive supply. Um and and so we're we're really excited about this project, um, you know, uh driven by kind of the overall benefits it'll bring to uh to Canada in in achieving uh you know achieving our um you know total emissions objectives of net zero by twenty fifty. This this is a key contributor to reducing So more to come, but perfect. And again, keeping on the line of emission reductions, you and others have obviously committed to carbon capture and sequestration. But w like w how is it progressing? How are the partner commitments? What are you looking from the government in terms of help? I mean it's a it's an excellent project but we don't get too many details on that carbon capture and sequestration project. So if you could just help us understand how the discussions are progressing between you and all the others and the government for that project. Yeah, thanks for the question. I'm excited to talk about it. Um we're we're we're making I think really, really good progress. Um you know th this is a very complex undertaking uh to achieve net zero by twenty fifty. Uh and and the alliance we've established uh amongst the member companies is unprecedented, the level of of cooperation. The amount of investment that will ultimately be required to get to net zero, you know, we've we've estimated as as seventy, seventy five billion dollars uh from now to twenty fifty. So, you know, it's a huge undertaking. It's not just one um single project, it's multiple projects. Um there there's a foundational project which is building this large trunk line that will allow the transport of carbon uh that's captured in the Fort McMurray area all the way down to the Cold Lake region uh where we've applied with the government for access to poor space so we can um so we can sequester the the carbon there. Um so you know building this large trunk line is is a significant project. But then there's several other projects around the capture side at each of the individual sites where we're you know pr producing uh hydrocarbons today. Um and then on top of that, um you know, as I just talked at Cold Lake, you know, not only are we focused on um capturing carbon and transporting it to a site to store it, but we're also looking at how can we fundamentally reduce the amount of carbon that's generated. And so things like solvent technologies are quite important there. So a lot of moving pieces, uh if you will, to uh to progress this project. But you know, we as as an alliance uh have been able to develop uh preliminary plans around uh kind of the sequence of the trunk line project, the the carbon capture projects as well as other technology initiatives. You know we we will talk more about that on investor day. But I think it's moving quite well. We are also spending a lot of time with both the federal and provincial government around enabling steps that are necessary to progress these huge investments. You know, specifically we are looking for investment tax credit and other financial support from the government given the nature of these investments, the risks associated with them. So so those discussions are are ongoing. Um the the cooperation amongst the companies is just exceptional. Um you know, in in fact as as CEOs, uh the six companies, we we get together every single week and and are having uh discussions about the progress of the project, key priorities, how do we keep it moving along, you know, what are some of the key issues. And again, as I mentioned, we're also actively uh engaged with with the government. as So CEOs we're we're meeting directly with key officials and certainly our our teams are meeting uh with with officials and staffs as well at at both the federal and the provincial levels. So, you know, it's all hands on deck. Um th this is a huge challenge, but we think it's achievable and we think it's necessary and so we're we're gonna do what it takes. That is that is great color and uh hoping to meet you at an in person uh investor day in March. Thank you, thank you. Well I I look forward to meeting you as as well. You know, unfortunately uh the the Omer Cron virus has has uh continued to to delay many in person meetings, but um you know, as soon as as as soon as the opportunity uh uh affords itself I very much look forward to it as well. It's been it's been a long two years, right? So uh so again I look forward to meeting you as well. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug McGee with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I'm delighted to be on your call. Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, I I I wonder if I could start with uh ExxonMobil's announcement yesterday of combining their downstream and chemicals business. I wonder if there's any read through for Imperial as it relates to incremental cost cutting initiatives or whether you follow suit. Yeah, thanks for the question, Doug, and it's it's it's good good to hear your voice. It's been a while since we've connected, so uh so thanks for joining the call today. Um you know, regarding ExxonMobil's announcements yesterday, um super, super exciting news um, you know, for for ExxonMobil and you know, with ExxonMobil being uh majority shareholder of Imperial, we benefit uh from that relationship in many ways. You know, we we often talk about uh the the technology uh benefits that we're able to leverage, kind of their global best practices, some some operational synergies. And and I think all of that comes to play uh with the announcement that was made yesterday. Um you know we're we still have a lot of work to do to fully understand their plans and then see how we can best leverage them and adapt them. But I I fully expect um that we will within Imperial see benefits uh from you know their announcements, the strategies that that they're progressing. And like I said, we're we're super excited. Okay, thank you for that. My my follow up is I I don't want to get ahead of myself here for your upcoming analyst day. I it it seems Exxon has also decided to go virtual and unfortunately, so I dunno what you ultimately decide. But um but my question is specifically on Carol. W when you laid out the kind of reliability trajectory um towards twenty twenty five, um it seems that you're well on your way to that. You're probably a little bit ahead of the pace I would guess. Is there any any thoughts you could you could provide in terms of the timing or the scale of what you ultimately see Carol doing on that original timeline? I'll leave it there. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for that question and and and you're right, you know, it is isn't un unfortunate some of the the impacts that uh that COVID has had on uh on plans from yesterday, you know, it impacted us last year, has the risk of impacting us this year. But you know, we're we're committed to uh to engaging uh you know with our investors, our analyst and and sharing our our forward plans. I think it's a very it's a very positive story. Um you know and and in terms of curl, you you're exactly right. You know, each year uh over the last couple of years we we continue to set new records at curl and uh you know and so as I mentioned, you know, we just completed twenty twenty one with uh two hundred sixty three thousand barrels a day um gross. Um our guidance for next year is two sixty five to two seventy, um which again moves us one step closer to to two eighty which as is as you accurately note, we had previously indicated that that we would get to 280 in that 2025 time frame, but we are well ahead of that. Um and and at investor day, you know, we'll lay out kind of a revised plan. But but but safe to say it's you know there's a lot of organizational focus on how we can get to that two hundred eighty thousand level sooner than than twenty twenty five. And and so, you know, some of the things we we've already done that will contribute are things like uh moving to one turnaround per year, which we achieved a year earlier than than what we shared at last investor day. Um we have multiple debottlenecking projects uh that that we're progressing. We're continuing to look at how do we optimize um you know ore recovery and uh and movement uh in in the mines and and then you know uh taking full advantage of of digital. Um you know I've talked on on prior calls about how we're employing multiple um digital techniques that are adding real value to us and you know that will also have beneficial effects on our production rates. So you know I I still f I I think 265 to 270 is is is appropriate for 2022, um but but you can see that's going to step us to 280 quicker than than the twenty twenty-five timeframe. And we'll, you know, Simon at Investor Day will give a lot more detail about those individual projects. Thanks for the full answer, guys. I look forward to it. Thanks again. Thanks Doc. Yeah, thanks, good morning, and thanks for the rundown as is always very thorough. Um again at the risk of probably jumping ahead, but but y uh y y yeah, Brad you mentioned, you know, that there are steps you're taking to strengthen the downstream business. I'm just wondering if if there are any things you can kinda share and whether the um you know like I'm assuming the product's pipeline you know fits into that mix but any color there would be great. Yeah thanks for the question Greg and and and you're right we'll we'll give a much more comprehensive story um at uh at Investor Day. But you know, it it it starts fundamentally with our cost structure and as I mentioned we've done a lot of things uh a around our cost structure um and and I feel really good uh about that and then it's it it's ensuring that we are leveraging um you know all the synergy that we have uh based on our our location of our three refineries, um the integration that they have between themselves but that they also have um with our upstream production assets um and then you know ensuring that we maximize the flexibility of their run slate you know, which has been key through the pandemic as we've had to adjust to much lower jet demand and move that into other products. And then look at where we have an opportunity to grow new product outlets. You know, we've talked about things we've done with asphalt uh over the last couple of years and how that's you know an increasing part of our portfolio and again leverages on our on our our heavy crude slate. Um and then you know most recently of course you, know, the the shred project and our ability to generate uh you know renewable diesel at Strathcona will be a key um strategic undertaking for us. Um and then of course uh you know the integration we have between uh Sarnia Refinery and Sarnia Chemical Plant also allows us to um you know f,urther capture market and value. And uh so again, you know, that that's kind of a broad brush on it. Uh you know John Wetmore uh will will give a much more comprehensive story at uh at Investor Day but uh but exciting opportunities for us uh in the downstream. Okay. No terrific. And and maybe now uh it's probably more of a question for Dan but, I mean just as an observation and we've been talking about a Civ for a long time. Um but w and I totally understand where you guys are coming from in terms of evaluation, but but maybe Dan specifically would it be possible for you to just frame what the mechanics are? Like I've never worked through one of these uh from that standpoint and and is it possible just to again enlighten us in terms of blackouts? Like I'm not trying to pin you down on the date per se because you're sort of saying within the June time frame. But I just I think I'd love to know what what needs to go into this in terms of formalizing your decision process. Yeah, I mean th technically the technicalities or the of an SIB I mean it requires a filing, it's it's open for thirty five days. Generally speaking you you you you shouldn't do it during during a blackout period, which which is typically sort of thirty days before earnings release. So that that's the that's sort of the um the the timing and technicalities of it. Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks, Greg. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Meta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Thanks so much. One of the core competencies that you've had and you brought into the business is is your background around MA given uh your prior role at at Exxon. And just be curious on your own perspective of of do you view Imperial as a logical consolidator, especially in light of the deferred tax uh position and and uh your success at turning around operations and and uh and scale and cost of capital. And it uh and if so, how do you think about balancing that versus return of capital? So big picture question, but any thoughts would be uh appreciated. Yeah, thanks Neil and and good to hear from you. Um you know, as we've said in the past, um we continue to keep an open mind, an open aperture around potential uh MA opportunities. Um it's it's not our top priority. Our top priority uh centers around our existing asset base um and maximizing value from those assets which I I think we we have demonstrated uh success over over the last couple of years and and has us well positioned for the future with you know, some very long life assets that um, you know, under under favorable markets will continue to generate significant cash. And uh so when we look at potential M and A opportunities, we we need to convince ourselves that not only do they fit into a long term strategy, but but they are accretive and and they do compete for capital relative to um you know the the the brownfield investments that that we already have identified and and are progressing. Um you know, we're we're not uh driven to acquire something just to grow for the sake of growing. In fact, you know, I think we've demonstrated our ability to grow with the existing asset base. So, you know, now this year we're at two sixty three, we expect to grow that to two sixty five to two seventy. And and within a relatively short time frame, you know, I expect we'll be at at two eighty or or higher. And so in a few short years we we will have added eighty thousand barrels a day of growth in our portfolio at a cost much, much lower than you know any acquisition we we could have contemplated. So that will continue to be the the priority is, you know, making sure we first focus on our existing assets. But, you know, there is a lot of consolidation occurring and uh and you know we we want to make sure we are making thoughtful decisions and so you know we we look at uh potential acquisitions and evaluate them and we discuss them as a management team and um and and you know that guides us accordingly. So so hope that answered your question. framework, Brad. And the the follow up is just around cash taxes. Can you just remind us, uh team, how you're how you're thinking about your deferred tax position. Good problem to have, to have a lot of earnings per share. Um but I would imagine that would also uh c take in create some considerations that we need to uh embed in the model going forward. Yeah, a absolutely. And Dan and his team spend a lot of time thinking about that and so I'll I'll ask him to answer. Yeah, well uh you know, just for the record, we're against cash taxes. Um if you didn't know our position, but uh we c you know, j we don't expect well in twenty twenty one uh actual actual cash taxes will be you know quite small. Twenty twenty two will be sort of a transition year and by twenty twenty three, you know, a current you know, with current you know economic conditions we'd expect to be to be fully tax paying. So, you know, I think that's probably as much as I I can tell you, but um well on a on a pure cash basis out the door um we should pay uh less than the statutory rate in in twenty twenty two, but by twenty twenty three, you know, we'll be full fully tax paying on on a cash basis. That's kind of where we are. Makes sense, Dan. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Men O'Holoshop with TD Securities. You may proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone, and uh thanks for uh squeezing me in. Uh most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I'll just uh to round things out with cost inflation. We have a pretty good sense of what that could look like for upstream across the the industry. But what what are you seeing in terms of cost pressures for downstream and would you be able to provide uh separate ranges for the two? Yeah, thanks for the question and and no doubt that is a uh is is an emerging theme, you know, a across industry and and and more broadly society right now with inflationary pressures from from lots of angles. You know, I I think um you know fortunately uh for us uh we we haven't seen huge impacts of of inflationary pressures yet, um but that's not to say we we won't going forward. You know, probably the single largest uh impact we've had i is around our own energy costs. Um, you know, where where we we we purchase natural gas um you know for for our facilities. Um and and obviously, you know, we all know what's happened there, but you know, as uh as as somebody who also produces uh energy, you know, on balance that's that's still favorable for us. Um you know we're we're taking a close look at other consumable supplies and things like that and you know first making sure we we we have access to the supplies and we're not impacted by any market shortages, um, but then also looking at, you know, how we can optimize the the cost and and mitigate any any cost pressures. Um, you know, where we could see, you know, more significant impacts would be things like um you know steel, for example. But the good news is, you know, when when we look at um our large projects um you know for for next year. You know, we talk about Sarnia Products Pipeline, you know, that project is essentially complete, steel bought, you know, a a long time ago. Um the curl in pit tailings project is you know has some steel associated with it, again, most of which has already been been procured, but it's more of a um you know earth moving project uh than than anything, um very labor intensive and so we got to keep an eye on labor costs but but again so far we we haven't seen huge impacts there. So something we're going to keep a very close eye on going forward. But but so far we've we've been able to manage it quite well. Thanks, Brad. I'll leave it there. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Our next question. Council Bill Gresh with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question. Yes, hi, good morning. My first question is on the on the dividend. Obviously, as you noted, two very large increases uh in the past two years since the last time uh you had an analyst day. Um and you had talked about you know a certain breakeven level uh at that time. So I I I was just wondering if you could refresh us on how you think about what that break even would be today. And then as you go forward, um, how do you think about sustainable levels of increases in the dividend um with respect to you know a break even framework or however else you might look at it for the question I think d Dan will give us an answer on that. Yeah, hey Phil we,'ll we'll talk more about break evens uh at the analyst day. I mean last year we we talked about um um uh you know thirty six bucks with um you know uh both including uh sustaining capital and dividend. I think that that's st stillill a a good number. So we're we're pretty far way away from that. So it is important to us obviously that w we the dividend a s a sustainable and growing dividend is is our is our core kind of but one of our core investor uh offerings and and we do think about that and we and we feel given given our outlook that that that the seven cents is is warranted and we feel quite good about it uh going forward. Um so I guess it's probably as much as much as I'll say, but you know our break even is is well below current prices. So um that gives us a lot of comfort. And obviously as we go forward we continue to, you know, we've had energy inflation as has been discussed, um, but we continue to work on our base cost structure. Um so you know obviously we want to get that break even down at as low as low as we can. Understood. Okay, thank you. Um and then just one other question on um the OpEx in the quarter. Obviously it was up sequentially. Um I wasn't sure if some of the one time costs that you called out in any way um flowed through OpEx or not, but just in general, um, you know, latest OpEx and twenty two. Yeah, of that, you know, hundred and sixty million, there there's a lot of things in there. There's there's deferred tax adjustments, there there's life phone inventory changes. But there's there's there's also I'd say sixty million dollars of OpEx in the upstream included in that number. So yeah, part part of that's uh uh part part of that one sixty is one time opex from some smaller Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks, Phil. Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would not like to turn the call back over to Dave Hughes for any further remarks. Alright. Well thank you very much, and thank you everybody for uh joining us this morning. As usual, if you have any further questions, uh please don't hesitate to reach out to us at any time. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

      "baseline" : "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to ExCo Technologies Limited First Quarter Resorts 2022. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode after A thisfter the. speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask the question during this session, you will need to press Father and 1 on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press thaw then zero. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Darren Kirk, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to EXCO Technologies Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Conference Call. I am Darren Kirk, CEO of EXCO. I will lead off with an operations overview. Matthew Posno, our CFO, will then review the financial results before we open the call for questions. Before I begin, I would like to make some comments about forward looking information. In yesterday's news release and on page two of the presentation that we have posted to our website, you'll find cautionary notes in that regard. While I won't repeat the contents, I want to emphasize that they apply to this discussion today. So it was a challenging quarter with several factors catching up to us. Lower vehicle production volumes due to ongoing chip shortage was the biggest contributor. However, labor disruption due to the greater spread of the Omicron variant, widespread inflationary pressures, inventory destocking, broader supply chain issues, and logistical constraints also contributed. But I want to emphasize that while the quarter was challenging and while our results were well below our recent performance, nothing has changed fundamentally for EXCO or our medium term outlook. We expect much stronger results in the quarters ahead. In fact, with that in mind, I am very pleased to announce that yesterday our board of directors approved a five percent increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of forty two cents per share. This is the 14th time ESCO has increased its dividend in the last 13 consecutive years. I'm not sure how many other companies have done this, but I do know it's a pretty exclusive club. Despite current headwinds, we remain encouraged by the underlying trends across our various businesses that will contribute to our future growth. I've mentioned several times before the automotive industry's transformation towards electric vehicles and focus on reducing emissions is extremely positive for ESCO's tooling businesses. As OEMs make the change to greener vehicles and strive for greater manufacturing efficiency, there is an increased use of light metals in the demand for our associated tooling. There is also increasing demand for technical expertise at the supplier level as products become larger and more complex. More broadly, we also expect to benefit from the trend towards larger and more complex castings across the industry as all OEMs seem likely to pursue this playbook. In addition, there is a heightened focus on efficiency by all manufacturers for sustainability initiatives that will be very positive for the entirety of our tooling business. In anticipation of these trends, we continue to make sizable investments in order to better position our various businesses to capture these opportunities. We are investing record sums of CAFEx this year across several initiatives, and we made great headway on advancing these projects during the quarter. By this point, I think the constrained supply of microchips impacting the OEM's ability to manufacture vehicles is well understood. Most industry players and analysts do, however, expect an improvement in supply as we go through twenty twenty two. IHS, for example, is anticipating a 17% increase in vehicle volumes in 2022 and a further eleven percent in 2023. It is important to understand that underlying demand for vehicles remains strong. This is evidenced by record high prices for used vehicles, significantly depleted dealer inventories, and an aging of the on-road vehicle fleet to historic levels. Turning to the quarter and first looking at our automotive solutions segment, overall vehicle production volumes in North America and Europe were down about twenty percent year over year. This drove our segment revenues lower, but we were additionally impacted by unfavorable vehicle and product mixhift, inventory restocking of EXCO's products in the supply chain, as well as our own operational and logistical constraints. New program launches contributed to our results this quarter, including one key new program where we are supplying sizable content on a fleet of commercial E V vans. This program will begin to ramp up more significantly in our third fiscal quarter and continue for several years. Moreover, we will continue to ramp up several other new key programs through twenty twenty three that will provide outsized growth relative to our historical performance. Meanwhile, quoting activity and new program awards remains very decent. We are seeing a number of sizable new opportunities, particularly with electric vehicles from both new and established OEMs. On the cost side, our margin suffered from greatly reduced overhead absorption due to the lower volumes. Although we also carried extra costs as we have retained surplus labor in anticipation that demand levels will rebound in the coming quarters. Fluctuations in the in forecast versus actual order releases were again problematic this quarter. This occurred as our customers juggled their own production schedules in response to the chip shortage issue. These challenges were pushed down to the supply base and placed strain on our own production planning process. Moreover, raw material cost increases picked up and we faced various supply chain challenges of our own. These elements required us to be nimble and also absorb a lot of extra costs related to overtime, material substitution, and expedited freight. Pricing remains tough in this business, and there is limited ability to use this tool as a lever. We did, however, take pricing action where possible to recover higher input costs. We will see the impact of these actions in our second quarter. In our casting and extrusion segment, our top line held up fairly well. In fact, we recorded modest growth over the prior year. The extrusion market remains strong this quarter with high demand across a number of end markets. Our extrusion tooling ultimately supports a diverse range of applications, including residential and industrial building and construction, solar panels, consumer durable products, and various modes of transportation. This quarter we again demonstrated we could keep up with the sizable demand growth by utilizing equipment and labor more efficiently while leveraging the harmonized manufacturing process of our numerous group facilities. With regards to the latter, this initiative has allowed us to centralize certain processes such as programming and design, and utilize our capacity on a network basis. All of this keeps our cost low, capacity high, and provides us with the ability to manufacture a quality product in a standardized manner. We are making significant strategic investments to further shrink lead times, drive down our operating costs, and in-source more of our own heat treat requirements, all while reducing our environmental footprint. The DICAS market, which is driven by automotive production, however, softened materially in the quarter as lower vehicle production was magnified by inventory destocking. This negatively impacted demand for cast tools consumable die cast tooling while the large mold group suffered from reduced rebuild work. Nonetheless, we achieved a number of program wins that will benefit future quarters. In fact, we achieved record levels of order intake in our large mold group, ending the quarter with the highest backlog in our history. We are very bullish on the long term outlook of this business given the growing demand for large and complex die cast components coupled with our leading market position, full service capabilities, and view that supply change will become more localized over time. As well, our additive tooling business continues to perform very strongly, contributing record levels of sales and order intake during the quarter. Additive tooling is a critical differentiator, providing us with an unmatched competitive edge, we are extremely optimistic on where this business will go. Looking at the casting and extrusion segment margins, we experienced weakness this quarter from levels that we have otherwise come to expect. Segment margins were impacted by unfavorable product mix, rising input costs, higher freight charges, and labor disruption due to COVID, all of which outpaced ongoing efficiency gains. As well, front-end losses at Castul's new plant in Morocco added to the margin pressure this quarter as revenue was only started to be generated towards the end of the quarter. We did take pricing action where possible through the quarter to protect our margins and expect the impact will be evident in our next quarter. Lastly, as we announced during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire HALEX, Europe's second largest manufacturer of extrusion dust. There's not really much more of an update at this time. We continue to work towards closing the acquisition this spring and welcoming Halex employees to ExCo at that time. That concludes my operations overview. I will now pass the call to Matthew to discuss the financial highlights of the quarter. Matthew? Thank you, Darren. Good morning. Consolidated sales for the first quarter end of december thirty first were one hundred and one million, a decrease of twenty point four million. Over the quarter, the consolidated impact of exchange rate movements reduced sales by three and a half million dollars. Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter sales at our automotive solution segment decreased. $186 million or 24%, and the casting and extrusion group sales were up 1.6 million or 4%. Consolidated net income for the first quarter was $2.7 million, or earnings of 7 cents per share compared to ten point nine million or twenty eight cents per share in the same quarter last year, a seventy five percent decrease in net income. The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was twenty six percent compared to twenty two percent in the prior year period. The income tax rate in the current year quarter was impacted by geographic distribution and foreign rate differentials. The automotive solution segment experienced a twenty seven percent decrease in sales in the first quarter or, decre aase of twenty point nine million dollars to fifty five point two million. The decrease in sales is attributed to lower OEM production volumes due to COVID nineteen constraints, related supply chain disruptions, storage including a shortage of semiconductor chips, unfavorable vehicle production mix, logistics challenges, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. First quarter pre-tax earnings in the automotive solutions segment totaled at $3.4 million, which is a decrease of $8.2 million or 71% over the same quarter last year. The segment's lower pre-tax profit is due to the 24% reduction in sales, causing lower overhead absorption and higher material log,istics, and labor costs. The casting and extrusion segment recorded sales of forty five point eight million dollars in the first quarter compared to forty five point three million last year, an increase of half a million dollars. The extrusion group experienced strong sales at its locations reflecting steady demand for extrusion tools and market share gains. The cast tool and large mold mold groups sales were down during the quarter due to the same supply chain disruptions caused by the A number of programs from current and new customers in the quarter. As a result, inventories and backlog are increasing. Pre tax earnings in the casting extrusion segment declined by two point six million dollars or seven percent over the same quarter last year to four point six million dollars. The impact of inflationary pressure on raw materials and transportation, combined with lower overhead absorption at cast tool and large mold, reduced pre-tax profit. EXCO generated cash from operating activities of eight million dollars during the quarter and five point two million of free cash flow after two point eight million dollars in maintenance fixed asset expenditures. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was more than sufficient to fund fixed assets for growth initiatives of eight point two million dollars and a three point million three point nine million dollars of dividend. EXCO ended the quarter with eleven point six million in net cash and thirty five point three million in available liquidity, including twenty six point three million of balance sheet cash. Exco's financial position remains very strong. As such, the company's balance sheet and availability under the existing credit facility allows considerable flexibility to support strategic initiatives like our HALEX extrusion purchase announced in December 2021. Our strong financial position combined with our free cash flow creates a foundation for management to pursue high value growth capital expenditures, dividends and other opportunities that may arise. That concludes my comments. We can now transition to the Q<unk>A portion of the call. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to ask the question, you would need to press farther than one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Again, that's star one to ask the question. Please stand by while we compile the QA roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Quomac Securities. Your line is open. Good morning everyone. what percentage of the contracts that you guys have in place were you were you able to reprice? And then just thinking about a more higher level, when you combine that with sort of that operational efficiencies that you guys are looking for, are are you guys able to offset that inflationary pressure and and hit your fifteen percent target or or are we thinking more longer term where we need to see some of these contracts roll off? Okay. Um so I I I I presume you're talking about the automotive solutions uh segment. Yeah, that's right. And um yeah, you know, a a lot of uh of that business is uh kind of fixed price work that continues for a number of years and um you know you uh kind of are exposed to rising raw material uh costs. And um you know, our path back to kind of a fifteen percent um segment even DAW margin uh certainly remains um very achievable uh in our minds. Um the that path includes kind of first getting back to uh normalized um sales levels and then having the benefit of uh the new program launches for uh over absorption of um uh of overhead uh that we uh plan uh through the next uh at least a couple of years. Uh and you know there there are pockets of um of products uh within the segment where we do have some pricing power and we're certainly and we have uh uh pursued that. Uh so um you know uh it it's it's probably uh the minority uh of products and the rest you have to offset with uh efficiency gains which, we continue to do. There are other aspects such as LTAs or long-term pricing adjustments, where you know have an obligation to reduce prices through the program, but um, you know, with pushback we expect that uh you know we'll we'll be successful in in in not taking those um reductions. So um you know th that's kind of at a high level uh how we think about the um uh the impact of of of rising um rising costs in that segment. Okay, understood. And then a lot of the discussion over the the last few quarters has been on your large mold division and the impact on sales from the shift to EV. Uh but one area that we haven't really touched on is the margin profile. So are are the molds for EV in your view, you know, similar to transmissions and engine blocks or or could they even be higher than than where the where your legacy business is today? Um yeah, I I wouldn't I wouldn't say that there is um you know a reason to expect uh a dissimilar uh margin for for EV molds as opposed to to powertrain. I mean just but just generally as um as molds get larger and more complex, it uh it reduces the number of players that can effectively compete uh in the space and uh requires much more sophisticated engineering and and technical depth. And you know you you would expect that that would be accompanied with with higher value add uh over time, but uh we're we're certainly not uh modeling that in. But uh I think the the logic folds together. All right. Ivan, why also for me? What kind of ramp can we expect at the uh new Castle facility? Is it something similar to what we've seen with the other greenfield facilities where you know it takes a couple of quarters to get up to profitability? Yeah, yeah, that's that's right. I mean there's uh certainly uh uh a few quarters of uh of drag uh in the profitability, but uh by by the end of uh of the fiscal year, we would uh certainly expect that facility to be uh at least even break even, uh if not better. Um our five year target that we have disclosed of um realising uh at least thirty million of revenue between Castul's plant in Morocco and then their planned new plant in Mexico by the end of that timeframe certainly holds certainly holds true. Okay, that's it for me. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Schuyler with BMO Cap.ital Markets My first question is um like you've done a really good job explaining, you know, how the earnings uh deteriorated year over year. But the uh I would just like to have a little bit of discussion versus quarter over quarter versus the fourth quarter. So like if you look at vehicle production volumes, like they were s you know, stronger global vehicle production volumes, North American Glo North American vehicle production volumes were stronger in Q one than they were in Q four, but like the earnings of the company in both segments really deteriorated rapidly, you know, or significantly versus the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out what has changed since the fourth quarter because arguably the you know the backdrop was pretty bad and was even worse than the fourth quarter, at least in terms of vehicle production volumes. Yeah, it's a good uh question, Peter. And uh I I would explain that we were um more so impacted by inventory d stocking in our first quarter than the fourth quarter. And um you know that that concept has really come come to a head uh during our latest quarter and you know just to kind of explain that, you know, if you're running um call it six die cast machines, uh you might have um twelve molds, uh six in production and and you know six backup. And uh as as volumes go down then um you know you you you first uh uh uh deplete your your backup dies rather than adding new new dies for for rebuild. And we really saw the impact of that this quarter. In fact we uh we only shipped one um uh one rebuilt die uh in in the quarter which is um highly, highly unusual for us. And um so um I guess the the converse of that is is on the way up um not only you know do you get the benefit of higher vehicle uh production, but then you get the uh the inventory replenishment that that needs to occur. And um with our um strong order flow that we saw in the quarter uh rising to record backlog uh in the large mold group. Uh we we certainly think and expect that we're at the front end of of that rebound. Similar dynamics would apply to CAS tools, uh DICAT consumable tooling components, which uh which did see um uh a more sizable dip uh this quarter than than what we saw in prior sequential quarters. Right. Okay. Um and can you talk a little bit about plant labor? So have you had trouble getting labor in the plant and has that disrupted your operations? Um yeah, uh for sure. I I think that um phenomenon is is pretty widespread um across all entities and it has been exacerbated by uh the Omicron variant uh in the last quarter where you know there were uh some weeks where where twenty percent of the the labor or more was uh was out uh due to uh uh due to that factor. And uh so it's uh it's a continuing challenge to uh to just find people. Um and then that uh um is is compounded by just the uh disruption that's uh that's occurred due to uh due to COVID. And you know we we continue to uh to work against that. Um it forces you to uh think about how you produce things and uh ultimately you need to become more efficient. And uh I think that one of the benefits that we've had uh over the years is we've we've added uh a lot more equipment and uh we really haven't uh increased our our head count. Um and so we we have become uh more efficient and will continue to uh to do so. And Darren, just back on this quarter over quarter theme, right? I understand you gave a good explanation why the you know the tooling businesses did worse, but also auto solutions did worse versus the fourth quarter. And you know, vehicle production volumes were higher in the first quarter than the fourth quarter. So what what happened? Um so that uh you know is is similar. Inventory uh the stocking I think was uh was was a big factor uh in that uh in that and then uh labor disruption uh as well and uh there there has been some elevated um raw material um in input cost inflation uh that uh we are uh have taken some measures to uh to reverse and as we've indicated uh in our comments and and in uh in the news release that we uh we expect to see the benefit of of that in our second quarter. Yeah, and Peter another component that we look at is is mix between different locations and we don't get into that level of detail in these calls, but we've had different mix of you know, production might have been up in certain areas, but depending on how it fit our mix and our production and our locations, that also caused some challenges there too. Okay. And then just my last question is in the write up you talked about the additive manufacturing business. I don't think I've heard that wording before. What what is the what is that? That's our uh three D uh printed tooling uh components and um we'd uh we'd we'd love to have uh you up to our new market plant, but uh that's been a a a very uh strong uh growth business and differentiator for us. But uh what we're talking about there is uh making parts of the the mold components um by printing them uh with steel. So we we we basically uh print a steel component and that enables us to um have water lines and and cooling lines uh that uh follow the contour of the mold and so we can target hot spots in the mold um much better using um three D printed components than um and make making those components uh traditionally. And uh that has uh an overall uh very positive impact on the cycle time and other measures such as scrap uh rates of of the uh of the casting process. And uh we are we are leaders uh in this business. Uh a couple of years ago uh we won the uh Automotive News Pace Award uh in recognition of uh our leadership of of this business and we're seeing greater and greater traction uh from uh from many customers uh and so we use these um additively produced components in our own mold molds and we also sell uh some of them uh as kind of um uh replacement uh components for uh for mold rebuilt. So uh it's a uh it's a it's a very exciting uh part of a lar large mole group and uh we expect it will have um you know very strong growth over the coming years. I understand. Is it is it like uh a prototype tooling or is it a prototype? No, it's a production tooling. It it is they're they're used in in the molds and and more and more of our molds, uh in fact most of them now, have uh three D printed uh mold components in them uh that serves to uh improve the efficiency uh of the overall mold. Interesting. Okay, thanks. That's all I have. Thanks Peter. Thanks, Peter. Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, that's star one to ask the question. I'm sure no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Darren for closing remarks. Well uh thanks everyone for um your time this morning. Uh we look forward to uh speaking to you again next quarter. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

      "reference" : "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Exco Technologies Limited First Quarter Results 2022. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a Question-and-answer session. To ask the question during the session, you will need to press * then one on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance please press * then zero. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Darren Kirk, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Thank you, Tuanda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Exco Technologies fiscal 2022 first quarter conference call. I am Darren Kirk, CEO of Exco. I will lead off with an operations overview. Matthew Posno, our CFO, will then review the financial results before we open the call for questions. Before I begin, I would like to make some comments about forward-looking information. In yesterday's news release and on page 2 of the presentation that we have posted to our website, you will find cautionary notes in that regard. While I won't repeat the contents, I want to emphasize that they apply to this discussion today. So it was a challenging quarter with several factors catching up to us. Lower vehicle production volumes due to ongoing chip shortage was the biggest contributor. However, labor disruption due to the greater spread of the Omicron variant, widespread inflationary pressures, inventory de-stocking, broader supply chain issues and logistical constraints also contributed. But I want to emphasize that while the quarter was challenging and while our results were well below our recent performance, nothing has changed fundamentally for Exco or our medium-term outlook. We expect much stronger results in the quarters ahead. In fact, with that in mind, I'm very pleased to announce that yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of $0.42 per share. This is the 14th time Exco has increased its dividend in the last 13 consecutive years. I'm not sure how many other companies have done this, but I do know it's a pretty exclusive club. Despite current headwinds we remain encouraged by the underlying trends across our various businesses that will contribute to our future growth. I've mentioned several times before, the automotive industry's transformation towards electric vehicles and focu- focus on reducing emissions is extremely positive for Exco tooling businesses. As OEMs make the change to greener vehicles and strive for greater manufacturing efficiency there is an increased use of light metals and the demand for our associated tooling. There is also increasing demand for technical expertise at the supplier level as products become larger and more complex. More broadly, we also expect to benefit from the trend towards larger and more complex castings across the industry as all OEMs seem likely to pursue this playbook. In addition, there is a heightened focus on efficiency by all manufacturers for sustainability initiatives that will be very positive for the entirety of our tooling business. In anticipation of these trends, we continue to make sizable investments in order to better position our various businesses to capture these opportunities. We are investing record sums of CapEx this year across several initiatives and we made great headway on advancing these projects during the quarter. By this point, I think the constrained supply of microchips impacting the OEM's ability to manufacture vehicles is well understood. Most industry players and analysts do, however, expect an improvement in supply as we go through 2022. IHS, for example, is anticipating a 17% increase in vehicle volumes in 2022 and a further 11% in 2023. It is important to understand that underlying demand for vehicles remains strong. This is evidenced by record high prices for used vehicles, significantly depleted dealer inventories and an aging of the on-road vehicle fleet to historic levels. Turning to the quarter, and first looking at our automotive solutions segment. Overall, vehicle production volumes in North America and Europe were down about 20% year-over-year. This drove our segment revenues lower, but we were additionally impacted by unfavorable vehicles and product mix shift, inventory destocking of Exco's products in the supply chain, as well as our own operational logistical constraints. New program launches contributed to our results this quarter, including one key new program where we are supplying sizable content on a fleet of commercial EV vans. This program will begin to ramp up more significantly in our third fiscal quarter and continue for several years. Moreover, we will continue to ramp up several other new key programs through 2023 that will provide outsized growth relative to our historical performance. Meanwhile, quoting activity and new program awards remains very decent. We are seeing a number of sizable new opportunities, particularly with electric vehicles from both new and established OEMs. On the cost side, our margin suffered from greatly reduced overhead absorption due to the lower volumes. Employee severance costs were also a factor, although we also carried extra cost as we have retained surplus labor in anticipation that demand levels will rebound in the coming quarters. Fluctuations in the, in forecast versus actual order releases were again problematic this quarter. This occurred as our customers juggled their own production schedules in response to the chip shortage issue. These challenges were pushed down to, to the supply base and place strain on our own production planning process. Moreover, raw material cost increases picked up and we faced various supply chain challenges of our own. These elements required us to be nimble and also absorbed a lot of extra costs related to over time material substitution and expedited freight. Pricing remains tough in this business and there is limited ability to use this tool as a lever. We did, however, take pri- pricing action where possible to recover higher input costs. We will see the impact of these actions in our second quarter. In our casting and extrusion segment, our top line held up fairly well. In fact, we recorded modest growth over the prior year. The extrusion market remains strong this quarter with high demand across a number of end markets. Our extrusion tooling ultimately supports a diverse range of applications, including residential and industrial building and construction, solar panels, consumer durable products and various modes of transportation. This quarter, we again demonstrated we could keep up with the sizable demand growth by utilizing equipment and labor more efficiently while leveraging the harmonized manufacturing process of our numerous group facilities. With regards to the latter, this initiative has allowed us to centralize certain processes such as programing and design and utilize our capacity on a network basis. All of this keeps our cost low, capacity high and provides us with the ability to manufacturer a quality product in a standardized manner. We are making significant strategic investments to further shrink lead times, drive down our operating costs and in-source more of our own heat-treat requirements, all while reducing our environmental footprint. The die-cast market, which is driven by automotive production, however, softened materially in the quarter as lower vehi- vehicle production was magnified by inventory de-stocking. This negatively impacted demand for Castool's consumable die-cast tooling, while The Large Mould group suffered from reduced rebuild work. Nonetheless, we achieved a number of program wins that will benefit future quarters. In fact we achieved record levels of order intake in our Large Mould group, ending the quarter with the highest backlog in our history. We are very bullish on the long-term outlook of this business given the growing demand for large and complex die-cast components coupled with our leading market position, full service capabilities and view that supply change will become more localized over time. As well, our additive tooling business continues to perform very strongly, contributing record levels of sales and order intake during the quarter. Additive tooling is a critical differentiator providing us with an unmatched competitive edge. We are extremely optimistic on where this business will go. Looking at the casting extrusion segment margins we experienced weakness this quarter from levels that we have otherwise come to expect. Segment margins were impacted by unfavorable product mix, rising input costs, higher freight charges and labor disruption due to COVID, all of which outpaced ongoing efficiency gains. As well, front end losses at Castool's new plant in Morocco added to the margin pressure this quarter as revenue was only started to be generated towards the end of the quarter. We did take pricing action where possible through the quarter to protect our margins and expect the impact will be evident in our next quarter. Lastly, as we announced during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire Halex, Europe's second-largest manufacturer of extrusion dies. There's not really much more of an update at this time, we continue to work towards closing the acquisition this spring and welcoming Halex employees to Exc- Exco at that time. That concludes my operations overview. I will now pass the call to Matthew to discuss the financial highlights of the quarter. Matthew? Thank you, Darren. Good morning. Consolidated sales for the first quarter ended December 31st were $101 million, a decrease of $20.4 million. Over the quarter the consolidated impact of exchange rate movements reduced sales by $3.5 million. Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter sales at our automotive solutions segment decreased $18.6 million or 24% and the Casting and Extrusion group sales were up $1.6 million or 4%. Consolidated net income for the first quarter was $2. 7 million or earnings of $0.07 per share compared to $10.9 million or $0.28 per share in the same quarter last year, a 75% decrease in net income. The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was 26% compared to 22% in the prior year period. The income tax rate in the current year quarter was impacted by geographic distribution and foreign rate differentials. The Automotive Solutions segment experienced a 27% decrease in sales in the first quarter or a decrease of $20.9 million to $55.2 million. The decrease in sales is attributable to lower OEM production volumes due to COVID-19 constraints, related supply chain disruptions, storage, including a shortage of semiconductor chips, unfavorable vehicle production mix, logistics challenges and the negative impact of foreign exchange. First quarter pre-tax earnings in the automotive solutions segment totaled $3.4 million, which is a decrease of $8.2 million or 71% over the same quarter last year. The segment's lower pretax profit is due to the 24% reduction in sales causing lower in- overhead absorption and higher material logistics and labor costs. The Casting and Extrusion segment recorded sales of $45.8 million in the first quarter compared to $45.3 million last year, an increase of half a million dollars. The Extrusion group experienced strong sales at locations reflecting steady demand for extrusion tools and market share gains. The Castool and Large Mo- Mould groups sales were down during the quarter due to the same supply chain disruptions caused by the semiconductor shortage, negatively impacting automotive vehicle production, lowering demand for consumable tooling for die casting and rebuild work for Mould. The Large Mould group quoted and was awarded a number of programs from current and new customers in the quarter. As a result, inventories and backlog are increasing. Pretax earnings in the Casting and Extrusion segment declined by $2.6 million or 7% over the same quarter last year to $4.6 million. The impact of inflationary pressure on raw materials and transportation combined with lower overhead absorption at Castool and Large Mould reduced pretax profit. Exco generated cash from operating activities of $8 million during the quarter and $5.2 million of free cash flow after $2.8 million in Maintenance Fixed Asset expenditures. This cash flow together with cash on hand was more than sufficient to fund fixed assets for growth initiatives of $8.2 million and a 3.9, $3.9 million of dividends. Exco ended the quarter with $11.6 million in net cash and $35.3 million in available liquidity, including $26.3 million of ca- balance sheet cash. Exco's financial position remains very strong. As such, the company's balance sheet and availability under the existing credit facility allows considerable flexibility to support strategic initiatives like our Halex extrusion purchase announced in December 2021. Our strong financial position, combined with our free cash flow creates the foundation for management to produ- high value growth capital expenditures, dividends and other opportunities that may arise. That concludes my comments. We can now transition to the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen as a reminder to ask the question you will need to press * then one on your telephone. To withdraw your question press the pound key. Again it's * one to ask the question. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Cormark Securities. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. Good morning David. Darren, I'm just curious, what percentage of the contracts that you guys have in place were you, were you able to reprice? Um, just thinking about it more higher level, when you combine that with sort of that operational efficiencies that you guys are looking for, are, are you guys able to offset that inflationary pressure and, and hit your 15% target or are we thinking more longer term where we need to see some of these contracts roll off? Okay. Um, so I, I, I presume you're talking about the automotive solutions, uh, segment. Yeah, that's right. And, um, yeah, you know, a lot of, uh, of that business is, uh, kinda fixed price work that continues for a number of years. And, um, you know, you uh, kind of are exposed to rising raw material, uh, costs. And, um, you know, our path back to kind of a 15%, um, segment inaudible margin certainly remains, um, very achievable in our minds. Um, the, that path includes kind of first getting back to, uh, normalized, um, sales levels and then having the benefit of, uh, the new program launches for over-absorption of, um, of overhead, uh, that we planned, uh, through the next, uh, at least couple of years. Uh, and, you know, there, there are pockets of, um, of products within the segment where we do have some pricing power, and we're certainly and we have, uh, uh, pursued that. Uh, so, um, you know, it's, it's probably uh, the minority of products, and the rest we have to offset with efficiency gains, which we continue to do. Uh, there are other aspects, such as, um, uh, LTA's or long-term pricing adjustments, where, um, you, uh, you know, have an obligation to reduce prices through the program. But, um, you know, with push back we expect that, uh, you know, we'll, we'll be successful in, in not taking those, um, reductions. So, um, you know, that's kind of at a high level, uh, how we think about the, um, uh, the impact of, of rising, um, rising costs in that segment. Okay, understood. And then, a lot of the discussion over the la- the last few quarters has been on your Large Mould division and the impact on sales from the shift to EV, but one area that we haven't really touched on is the margin profile. So are the moulds for EV, in your view, you know, similar to transmissions and engine blocks or, or could they even be higher than, than where the, where your legacy business is today? Um, yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that there is, um, you know, a reason to expect a, a dissimilar margin for, for EV molds as opposed to, to powertrain. I mean, just by chip generally as, um, as moulds get larger and more complex, it, uh, it reduces the number of players that can effectively compete, uh, in this space and requires much more sophisticated engineering and technical depth. And you know, you, you would expect that that would be accompanied with, with higher value add over time, but we're, we're certainly not modeling that in. But, uh, I think the logic folds together. And then, last one for me. What kind of ramp can we expect at the new Castool facility? Is it something similar to what we've seen in the other greenfield facilities where, you know, it takes a couple of quarters to get up to profitability? Yeah, yeah, that's right. I mean there is, uh, certainly a, a few quarters of, uh, of drag, uh, in the profitability, but, uh, by, by the end of, uh, of the fiscal year we would certainly expect that facility to be, uh, at least EBITDA breakeven, if not better. Um, our five year target that we have disclosed of realizing, uh, at least $30 million of revenue between Castool's plant in Morocco and then their, uh, plants, new plant in Mexico by the end of that time frame certainly holds, uh, uh, certainly holds true. Okay. That's it from me. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Sklar with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yeah. Good morning, Darren and Matthew. Um, my first question is, um, like, you've done a really good job explaining, you know, how the earnings, uh, deteriorated year-over-year, but the, I would just like to have a little bit of discussion versus quarter over quarter versus the fourth quarter. So, like, if you look at vehicle production volumes like they were s- you know, stronger, global vehicle production volumes, North American glo- North American vehicle production volumes were stronger in Q1 than they were in Q4. But like the earnings of the company in both segments really deteriorated rapidly, you know, or significantly versus the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out what has changed since the fourth quarter, because arguably, you know, the backdrop was pretty bad and was even worse in the fourth quarter, at least in terms of vehicle production volumes. Yeah. It's a good, uh, question, Peter. And, uh, I, I would explain that we were, um, more so impacted by inventory de-stocking in our first quarter than the fourth quarter. And, um, you know, that, that concept is really come, come to a head, uh, during our latest quarter. And, you know, just to kind of explain that, you know, if you're running, um, call it, six die-cast machines, uh, you might have, um, 12 moulds, uh, six in production and six back up. And, uh, as, as volumes go down then, um, you know, your, your first, uh, deplete your, your back up dies rather than adding new, new dies for, for rebuild. And we really saw the impact of that this quarter. In fact, we only shipped one, um, one rebuilt die, uh, in, in the quarter, which is highly, highly unusual for us. And, um, so, um, I guess that the converse of that is, is on the way up. Um, not only do you get the benefit of higher vehicle, uh, production, but then you've got the, uh, the inventory replenishment that, that needs to occur. And, um, with our strong order flow that we saw in the quarter, uh, rising to record backlog, uh, in the Large Mould group, uh, we, we certainly think and expect that we're at the front end of, of that rebound. Okay and- Similar dynamics would apply to Castool's die-cast consumable tooling components which, uh, which did see um, uh, a more sizable dip, uh, this quarter than, than what we saw in prior sequential quarters. Right, okay. Um, and can you talk a little bit about plant labor? So have you had trouble getting labor in the plant and has that disrupted your operations? Um, yeah, uh, for sure. I, I think that, um, phenomenon is, is pretty widespread, um, across all entities. Um, and it has been exacerbated by, uh, the Omicron variant in the last quarter where, you know, there were some weeks where, where 20% of the, the labor or more was, uh, was out, uh, due to, uh, uh, due to that factor. And, uh, so, it's a, it's a continuing challenge to, uh, to just find people and then that is compounded by just the disruption that's, uh, that's occurred due to, uh, due to COVID. And, you know we, we continue to, uh, to work against that. Um, it forces you to think about how you produce things and, uh, ultimately you need to become more efficient. And, uh, I think that one of the benefit that we've had over the years is we've added uh, a lot more equipment and, uh, we really haven't, uh, increased our, our head count. Um, and so, we have become more efficient and we'll continue to, uh, to do so. And Darren, just back on this quarter over quarter theme, right? I understand, you gave a good explanation why the, you know, the tooling businesses did worse. But also auto solutions did worse versus the fourth quarter and you know, vehicle production volumes were higher in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. So what, what happened there? Um, so that, uh, you know, is, is similar. Inventory, uh, de-stocking I think was a, was, was a big factor, uh, in that, uh, and then labor disruption, uh, as well. And there, there has been some elevated, um, raw material and input cost inflation, uh, that, uh, we are, uh, have taken some measures to, uh, to reverse. And as we've indicated, uh, in our comments and, and in, uh, in the news release that we, uh, we expect to see the benefit of, of that in our second quarter. Yeah. And Peter another component that we look at is, is mix between different locations and we don't get into that level of detail on these calls, but we've had different mix of, you know, production might have been up in certain areas, but depending on how it fit our mix and our production and our locations that also caused some challenges there too. Okay. And then just my last question is in the write-up you talked about the additive manufacturing business. I don't think I've heard that wording before, what, what is, the, what is that? That's our 3D printed tooling, uh, components. And, um, we'd, uh, we'd love to have, uh, be, be up to our new market plan, but that's been a, a very, uh, strong growth business and differentiator for us. But, uh, what we're talking about there is making parts of the, the mould components, um, by printing them, uh, with steel. So we, we, we basically print a steel component and that enables us to, um, have water lines in, in tooling lines, uh, that follow the contour of the mould. And so we can target hotspots in the mold, um, much better using, um, 3D printed components than, um, than ma- making those components, uh, traditionally. And, uh, that has an overall, uh, very positive impact on the cycle time and other measures such as scrap, uh, rates of, of the, of the casting process. And, uh, we are, we are leaders, uh, in this business, a couple of years ago, uh, we won the, uh, Automotive News PACE Award in recognition of our leadership of, of this business. And we're seeing greater and greater traction, uh, from, uh, from many customers. Uh, and so, we use these, um, actively produced components in our own mo- moulds and we also sell, uh, some of them, uh, as kind of, um, replacement, uh, components for, uh, for mould rebuild. So, uh, it's a, uh, it's, it's a very exciting, uh, part of the La- Large Mould group and we expect it will have, um, you know, very strong growth over the coming years. I understand. Is it, is it like a, a prototype tooling or is it a prototype- No, it's a production tooling. crosstalk they use them in the molds and in more and more of our moulds in fact most of them now have, uh, 3D printed mould components in them, uh, that serves to, uh, improve the efficiency of the overall mold. Hmm. Interesting. Okay, thanks. That's all I have. Thanks Peter. Thanks Peter. Thank you. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, that * one to ask the question. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Darren for closing remarks. Well, uh, thanks everyone for, um, your time this morning. Uh, we look forward to, uh, speaking to you again next quarter. Take care. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",
      "withCtc" : "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to ExCo Technologies Limited First Quarter Resorts 2022. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode after A thisfter the. speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask the question during this session, you will need to press Father and 1 on your telephone. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press thaw then zero. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Darren Kirk, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to EXCO Technologies Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Conference Call. I am Darren Kirk, CEO of EXCO. I will lead off with an operations overview. Matthew Posno, our CFO, will then review the financial results before we open the call for questions. Before I begin, I would like to make some comments about forward looking information. In yesterday's news release and on page two of the presentation that we have posted to our website, you'll find cautionary notes in that regard. While I won't repeat the contents, I want to emphasize that they apply to this discussion today. So it was a challenging quarter with several factors catching up to us. Lower vehicle production volumes due to ongoing chip shortage was the biggest contributor. However, labor disruption due to the greater spread of the Omicron variant, widespread inflationary pressures, inventory destocking, broader supply chain issues, and logistical constraints also contributed. But I want to emphasize that while the quarter was challenging and while our results were well below our recent performance, nothing has changed fundamentally for EXCO or our medium term outlook. We expect much stronger results in the quarters ahead. In fact, with that in mind, I am very pleased to announce that yesterday our board of directors approved a five percent increase in our dividend to an annualized rate of forty two cents per share. This is the 14th time ESCO has increased its dividend in the last 13 consecutive years. I'm not sure how many other companies have done this, but I do know it's a pretty exclusive club. Despite current headwinds, we remain encouraged by the underlying trends across our various businesses that will contribute to our future growth. I've mentioned several times before the automotive industry's transformation towards electric vehicles and focus on reducing emissions is extremely positive for ESCO's tooling businesses. As OEMs make the change to greener vehicles and strive for greater manufacturing efficiency, there is an increased use of light metals in the demand for our associated tooling. There is also increasing demand for technical expertise at the supplier level as products become larger and more complex. More broadly, we also expect to benefit from the trend towards larger and more complex castings across the industry as all OEMs seem likely to pursue this playbook. In addition, there is a heightened focus on efficiency by all manufacturers for sustainability initiatives that will be very positive for the entirety of our tooling business. In anticipation of these trends, we continue to make sizable investments in order to better position our various businesses to capture these opportunities. We are investing record sums of CAFEx this year across several initiatives, and we made great headway on advancing these projects during the quarter. By this point, I think the constrained supply of microchips impacting the OEM's ability to manufacture vehicles is well understood. Most industry players and analysts do, however, expect an improvement in supply as we go through twenty twenty two. IHS, for example, is anticipating a 17% increase in vehicle volumes in 2022 and a further eleven percent in 2023. It is important to understand that underlying demand for vehicles remains strong. This is evidenced by record high prices for used vehicles, significantly depleted dealer inventories, and an aging of the on-road vehicle fleet to historic levels. Turning to the quarter and first looking at our automotive solutions segment, overall vehicle production volumes in North America and Europe were down about twenty percent year over year. This drove our segment revenues lower, but we were additionally impacted by unfavorable vehicle and product mixhift, inventory restocking of EXCO's products in the supply chain, as well as our own operational and logistical constraints. New program launches contributed to our results this quarter, including one key new program where we are supplying sizable content on a fleet of commercial E V vans. This program will begin to ramp up more significantly in our third fiscal quarter and continue for several years. Moreover, we will continue to ramp up several other new key programs through twenty twenty three that will provide outsized growth relative to our historical performance. Meanwhile, quoting activity and new program awards remains very decent. We are seeing a number of sizable new opportunities, particularly with electric vehicles from both new and established OEMs. On the cost side, our margin suffered from greatly reduced overhead absorption due to the lower volumes. Although we also carried extra costs as we have retained surplus labor in anticipation that demand levels will rebound in the coming quarters. Fluctuations in the in forecast versus actual order releases were again problematic this quarter. This occurred as our customers juggled their own production schedules in response to the chip shortage issue. These challenges were pushed down to the supply base and placed strain on our own production planning process. Moreover, raw material cost increases picked up and we faced various supply chain challenges of our own. These elements required us to be nimble and also absorb a lot of extra costs related to overtime, material substitution, and expedited freight. Pricing remains tough in this business, and there is limited ability to use this tool as a lever. We did, however, take pricing action where possible to recover higher input costs. We will see the impact of these actions in our second quarter. In our casting and extrusion segment, our top line held up fairly well. In fact, we recorded modest growth over the prior year. The extrusion market remains strong this quarter with high demand across a number of end markets. Our extrusion tooling ultimately supports a diverse range of applications, including residential and industrial building and construction, solar panels, consumer durable products, and various modes of transportation. This quarter we again demonstrated we could keep up with the sizable demand growth by utilizing equipment and labor more efficiently while leveraging the harmonized manufacturing process of our numerous group facilities. With regards to the latter, this initiative has allowed us to centralize certain processes such as programming and design, and utilize our capacity on a network basis. All of this keeps our cost low, capacity high, and provides us with the ability to manufacture a quality product in a standardized manner. We are making significant strategic investments to further shrink lead times, drive down our operating costs, and in-source more of our own heat treat requirements, all while reducing our environmental footprint. The DICAS market, which is driven by automotive production, however, softened materially in the quarter as lower vehicle production was magnified by inventory destocking. This negatively impacted demand for cast tools consumable die cast tooling while the large mold group suffered from reduced rebuild work. Nonetheless, we achieved a number of program wins that will benefit future quarters. In fact, we achieved record levels of order intake in our large mold group, ending the quarter with the highest backlog in our history. We are very bullish on the long term outlook of this business given the growing demand for large and complex die cast components coupled with our leading market position, full service capabilities, and view that supply change will become more localized over time. As well, our additive tooling business continues to perform very strongly, contributing record levels of sales and order intake during the quarter. Additive tooling is a critical differentiator, providing us with an unmatched competitive edge, we are extremely optimistic on where this business will go. Looking at the casting and extrusion segment margins, we experienced weakness this quarter from levels that we have otherwise come to expect. Segment margins were impacted by unfavorable product mix, rising input costs, higher freight charges, and labor disruption due to COVID, all of which outpaced ongoing efficiency gains. As well, front-end losses at Castul's new plant in Morocco added to the margin pressure this quarter as revenue was only started to be generated towards the end of the quarter. We did take pricing action where possible through the quarter to protect our margins and expect the impact will be evident in our next quarter. Lastly, as we announced during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire HALEX, Europe's second largest manufacturer of extrusion dust. There's not really much more of an update at this time. We continue to work towards closing the acquisition this spring and welcoming Halex employees to ExCo at that time. That concludes my operations overview. I will now pass the call to Matthew to discuss the financial highlights of the quarter. Matthew? Thank you, Darren. Good morning. Consolidated sales for the first quarter end of december thirty first were one hundred and one million, a decrease of twenty point four million. Over the quarter, the consolidated impact of exchange rate movements reduced sales by three and a half million dollars. Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter sales at our automotive solution segment decreased. $186 million or 24%, and the casting and extrusion group sales were up 1.6 million or 4%. Consolidated net income for the first quarter was $2.7 million, or earnings of 7 cents per share compared to ten point nine million or twenty eight cents per share in the same quarter last year, a seventy five percent decrease in net income. The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was twenty six percent compared to twenty two percent in the prior year period. The income tax rate in the current year quarter was impacted by geographic distribution and foreign rate differentials. The automotive solution segment experienced a twenty seven percent decrease in sales in the first quarter or, decre aase of twenty point nine million dollars to fifty five point two million. The decrease in sales is attributed to lower OEM production volumes due to COVID nineteen constraints, related supply chain disruptions, storage including a shortage of semiconductor chips, unfavorable vehicle production mix, logistics challenges, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. First quarter pre-tax earnings in the automotive solutions segment totaled at $3.4 million, which is a decrease of $8.2 million or 71% over the same quarter last year. The segment's lower pre-tax profit is due to the 24% reduction in sales, causing lower overhead absorption and higher material log,istics, and labor costs. The casting and extrusion segment recorded sales of forty five point eight million dollars in the first quarter compared to forty five point three million last year, an increase of half a million dollars. The extrusion group experienced strong sales at its locations reflecting steady demand for extrusion tools and market share gains. The cast tool and large mold mold groups sales were down during the quarter due to the same supply chain disruptions caused by the A number of programs from current and new customers in the quarter. As a result, inventories and backlog are increasing. Pre tax earnings in the casting extrusion segment declined by two point six million dollars or seven percent over the same quarter last year to four point six million dollars. The impact of inflationary pressure on raw materials and transportation, combined with lower overhead absorption at cast tool and large mold, reduced pre-tax profit. EXCO generated cash from operating activities of eight million dollars during the quarter and five point two million of free cash flow after two point eight million dollars in maintenance fixed asset expenditures. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was more than sufficient to fund fixed assets for growth initiatives of eight point two million dollars and a three point million three point nine million dollars of dividend. EXCO ended the quarter with eleven point six million in net cash and thirty five point three million in available liquidity, including twenty six point three million of balance sheet cash. Exco's financial position remains very strong. As such, the company's balance sheet and availability under the existing credit facility allows considerable flexibility to support strategic initiatives like our HALEX extrusion purchase announced in December 2021. Our strong financial position combined with our free cash flow creates a foundation for management to pursue high value growth capital expenditures, dividends and other opportunities that may arise. That concludes my comments. We can now transition to the Q<unk>A portion of the call. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to ask the question, you would need to press farther than one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Again, that's star one to ask the question. Please stand by while we compile the QA roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Quomac Securities. Your line is open. Good morning everyone. what percentage of the contracts that you guys have in place were you were you able to reprice? And then just thinking about a more higher level, when you combine that with sort of that operational efficiencies that you guys are looking for, are are you guys able to offset that inflationary pressure and and hit your fifteen percent target or or are we thinking more longer term where we need to see some of these contracts roll off? Okay. Um so I I I I presume you're talking about the automotive solutions uh segment. Yeah, that's right. And um yeah, you know, a a lot of uh of that business is uh kind of fixed price work that continues for a number of years and um you know you uh kind of are exposed to rising raw material uh costs. And um you know, our path back to kind of a fifteen percent um segment even DAW margin uh certainly remains um very achievable uh in our minds. Um the that path includes kind of first getting back to uh normalized um sales levels and then having the benefit of uh the new program launches for uh over absorption of um uh of overhead uh that we uh plan uh through the next uh at least a couple of years. Uh and you know there there are pockets of um of products uh within the segment where we do have some pricing power and we're certainly and we have uh uh pursued that. Uh so um you know uh it it's it's probably uh the minority uh of products and the rest you have to offset with uh efficiency gains which, we continue to do. There are other aspects such as LTAs or long-term pricing adjustments, where you know have an obligation to reduce prices through the program, but um, you know, with pushback we expect that uh you know we'll we'll be successful in in in not taking those um reductions. So um you know th that's kind of at a high level uh how we think about the um uh the impact of of of rising um rising costs in that segment. Okay, understood. And then a lot of the discussion over the the last few quarters has been on your large mold division and the impact on sales from the shift to EV. Uh but one area that we haven't really touched on is the margin profile. So are are the molds for EV in your view, you know, similar to transmissions and engine blocks or or could they even be higher than than where the where your legacy business is today? Um yeah, I I wouldn't I wouldn't say that there is um you know a reason to expect uh a dissimilar uh margin for for EV molds as opposed to to powertrain. I mean just but just generally as um as molds get larger and more complex, it uh it reduces the number of players that can effectively compete uh in the space and uh requires much more sophisticated engineering and and technical depth. And you know you you would expect that that would be accompanied with with higher value add uh over time, but uh we're we're certainly not uh modeling that in. But uh I think the the logic folds together. All right. Ivan, why also for me? What kind of ramp can we expect at the uh new Castle facility? Is it something similar to what we've seen with the other greenfield facilities where you know it takes a couple of quarters to get up to profitability? Yeah, yeah, that's that's right. I mean there's uh certainly uh uh a few quarters of uh of drag uh in the profitability, but uh by by the end of uh of the fiscal year, we would uh certainly expect that facility to be uh at least even break even, uh if not better. Um our five year target that we have disclosed of um realising uh at least thirty million of revenue between Castul's plant in Morocco and then their planned new plant in Mexico by the end of that timeframe certainly holds certainly holds true. Okay, that's it for me. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Schuyler with BMO Cap.ital Markets My first question is um like you've done a really good job explaining, you know, how the earnings uh deteriorated year over year. But the uh I would just like to have a little bit of discussion versus quarter over quarter versus the fourth quarter. So like if you look at vehicle production volumes, like they were s you know, stronger global vehicle production volumes, North American Glo North American vehicle production volumes were stronger in Q one than they were in Q four, but like the earnings of the company in both segments really deteriorated rapidly, you know, or significantly versus the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out what has changed since the fourth quarter because arguably the you know the backdrop was pretty bad and was even worse than the fourth quarter, at least in terms of vehicle production volumes. Yeah, it's a good uh question, Peter. And uh I I would explain that we were um more so impacted by inventory d stocking in our first quarter than the fourth quarter. And um you know that that concept has really come come to a head uh during our latest quarter and you know just to kind of explain that, you know, if you're running um call it six die cast machines, uh you might have um twelve molds, uh six in production and and you know six backup. And uh as as volumes go down then um you know you you you first uh uh uh deplete your your backup dies rather than adding new new dies for for rebuild. And we really saw the impact of that this quarter. In fact we uh we only shipped one um uh one rebuilt die uh in in the quarter which is um highly, highly unusual for us. And um so um I guess the the converse of that is is on the way up um not only you know do you get the benefit of higher vehicle uh production, but then you get the uh the inventory replenishment that that needs to occur. And um with our um strong order flow that we saw in the quarter uh rising to record backlog uh in the large mold group. Uh we we certainly think and expect that we're at the front end of of that rebound. Similar dynamics would apply to CAS tools, uh DICAT consumable tooling components, which uh which did see um uh a more sizable dip uh this quarter than than what we saw in prior sequential quarters. Right. Okay. Um and can you talk a little bit about plant labor? So have you had trouble getting labor in the plant and has that disrupted your operations? Um yeah, uh for sure. I I think that um phenomenon is is pretty widespread um across all entities and it has been exacerbated by uh the Omicron variant uh in the last quarter where you know there were uh some weeks where where twenty percent of the the labor or more was uh was out uh due to uh uh due to that factor.

So uh it's a uh it's a it's a very exciting uh part of a lar large mole group and uh we expect it will have um you know very strong growth over the coming years. I understand. Is it is it like uh a prototype tooling or is it a prototype? No, it's a production tooling. It it is they're they're used in in the molds and and more and more of our molds, uh in fact most of them now, have uh three D printed uh mold components in them uh that serves to uh improve the efficiency uh of the overall mold.

      "baseline" : "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ATS Automation Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. This call is being recorded on February second, twenty twenty two at eight thirty AM Eastern Time. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. If anyone has difficulty during the conference, please press star, followed by zero for operator assistance at any time. I will now turn the call over to Stuart McQueg, Vice. Thanks, Operator, and good morning everyone. Your main hosts today are Andrew Hyder, Chief Executive Officer of ATS, and Ryan McLeod, Chief Financial Officer. We note that our remarks today are accompanied by a slide deck displayed on the screen in the webcast, and which is also available, including for those joining by phone, at ATSAutomation.com. We caution that the statements made on the webcast and call may contain forward-looking information and our cautionary statement regarding such information, including the material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements, and the material factors or assumptions applied in making the statements are detailed on slide two of the slide deck. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Stuart. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another strong quarter for ATS, featuring order bookings, order backlog, and revenue records, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion. Although the pandemic and supply chain disruptions created a challenging and fluid business environment. Organic revenue growth was robust. Newly acquired businesses performed a plan, and we completed two acquisitions. SP Industries expands our capabilities and offerings throughout the life cycle of pharmaceutical development. DF enhances our offerings and aseptic fill finish. Today, I will update you on our business and then Ryan will provide his financial report. Starting with our value drivers, Q three revenues were five hundred and forty seven million dollars up forty eight percent from two three last year driven by a combination of acquired businesses and strength across our core operations. Organically, revenues grew twenty two percent year over year, a positive result that was augmented by the pandemic impact on Q three revenues in the prior year. Q three order bookings were a record six hundred and seventy-one million dollars, up fifty-four percent year over year. CFT, Biodot, and SP contributed approximately two thirds of order bookings growth versus last year. Bookings were strong across most market verticals, with large customer awards and consumer products and transportation. Our adjusted EVIT margin for the quarter was twelve point nine percent, representing margin expansion of over a hundred basis points from Q three of last year. Moving to our outlook. Our backlog grew to a record one point five billion dollars at the end of the quarter, providing us with a solid base of business and good revenue visibility. The pandemic situation remains fluid, and we continue to work with our customers and employees to manage the challenges, including newly imposed travel restrictions in certain jurisdictions and supply chain interruptions. Despite the challenges, our teams have done an excellent job to ensure customer needs are met. By market, conditions remain positive in life sciences, with good activity in our key sectors of medical devices, pharma, and radio pharma. Today, our funnel is comprised of more traditional, non-COVID-related opportunities. In EV, we continue to see robust activity levels with rapid growth in the battery assembly market. We won several mandates during the quarter, including a large award from a repeat customer. As our customers experience new complexities from evolving battery technologies, our long track record and proven expertise in the battery assembly and test space position ATS as a trusted partner. In food and beverage, our order funnel remains strong with opportunities in food processing leading the way. In consumer, we're seeing continued activity in warehouse automation. In energy, the market for automated tools and related services for nuclear refurbishment is expanding. The decommissioning market also continues to evolve, and we see prospects in both North America and globally. There are also emerging opportunities in isotope production and small modular reactor markets, as well as grid batteries. On services, order bookings grew both year for year and sequentially. Utilization and expansion of our regional service network coupled with the use of digital support tools have improved our ability to support our customers. In turn, our customers continue to embrace our digital services platform. We see opportunities to expand our aftermarket services footprint and add to our digital capabilities. Operationally, we faced a challenging business environment resulting from global supply chain issues and the pandemic. We've experienced some supplier lead time extensions, and our team has completed several related problemv-ingsol events. These challenges are likely to persist in the near term. To summarize our outlook, this quarter included record order bookings, record order backlog, and a robust funnel. We're encouraged by recent activity levels. However, global supply chain and labor market dynamics represent a challenge and uncertainty. The situation is actively monitored and countermeasures implemented wherever possible. Moving to the ABM, our continuous improvement playbook. This was another busy quarter with continued emphasis on improving our value drivers, both operationally and commercially. Our linear motion business held the Kaisen to remove waste from a critical assembly process. The kaizen resulted in a 50% reduction in floor space, lower inventory requirements, and a 20% improvement in cycle time. A life sciences division held a Kaizen on their spur parts order processing. Through collaborative efforts, they were able to improve efficiency by 50%. Our services business held a joint kaizen with a customer to define requirements for a turnkey training, execution, and spare parts management program. These joint efforts are a great way to provide value to our customers while also strengthening our relationships. We continue to employ our global virtual ABM boot camps on the back of similar successful events and proceeding. quarters The camp runs over a six week period and combines self paced learning and real time discussions with ABM leaders. This modified virtual format enables us to continue scaling our training and demonstrates how businesses across ATS use the ABM to drive tangible results. On MA, acquisitions and strategic core markets continue to be an important complement to ATS's organic growth. During the quarter, we closed two acquisitions, SP being the largest in ATS history. SP is a designer and manufacturer of high-grade biopharma processing equipment, life sciences equipment, and lab apparatus products. SP expands our life sciences capabilities and offerings through the addition of its aseptic and non-aseptic Lyle portfolio. Notably, the combination of ATS and SP will allow us to better support the needs of our customers throughout the life cycle of pharmaceutical development and production. After deploying capital to these latest acquisitions, our balance sheet remains strong. We will continue to cultivate and evaluate acquisition opportunities consistent with our proven strategy. Of course, timing of acquisitions will be variable, and our approach to deploying our balance sheet will be disciplined and strategic, as will the integrations that follow. Of note, we continue to make progress in the integration of previous acquisitions, including CFT, which was acquired last March, Biodot, acquired in June, and NCC, which joined in September. At Biodot, administrative tasks associated with the integration are largely complete, and our efforts are focused on continuing to deploy the ABM playbook. At CFT, we continue to roll out the ATS business model, focused on opportunities to further synergies in our supply chains and cost structures, and completed several ABM activities. These included standard work events, a raw material problem solving event and a communication kaizen which drove increased awareness and engagement across the business. At ATS, our innovation activities are ongoing as they form part of our expand strategy. In the past quarter, we have completed a number of projects and initiatives that have resulted in the launch of a new highed-spe debug camera, GMP testing and certification of our SuperTrack Pharma product, and the development of a new energy management software program that will enable customers to track and reduce their carbon footprint. We're pleased that our acquired company are also innovators. At the recent Chicago Process Expo, our NCC business won the Innovation Award for the Sanitary Design of the NCC Side Drive Conveyance System. We have filed the patent for this system, which has multiple applications, including raw and packaged food products. Congratulations to the whole NCC team. Well done. In summary, the results of the quarter and year-to-ated demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business and portfolio offerings. Record order booking activity reflects the alignment we have with our customers in providing best-ins-clas solutions. Going forward, we are unwavering in our commitment to protecting and engaging our employees, serving our customers well, and creating value for our shareholders. We will execute on these priorities through the application of the ABM playbook with the goal of driving continuous improvement in our performance. Our record order backlog provides good revenue visibility, while the healthy balance sheet enables pursuit of organic growth and strategic MA opportunities. Our objective is to build a great ATS business. And we're making progress every day towards our collective goal. Now I will turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan, over to you. Thank you, Andrew. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning I will provide an overview of our Q3 operating results that featured growth and revenues, both year over year and sequentially, adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and record order bookings and backlog. I will then review our balance sheet, which we have deployed strategically to expand our customer capabilities and earnings potential. Starting with operating results. Bookings were six hundred and seventy one million, up 54% compared to Q3 last year. Organic growth in bookings was 18%, partially offset by a 5% headwind from foreign exchange translation. Organic growth came from transportation as a result of new and follow-on work in EV, energy markets due to follow-on work, and consumer products due to a large customer program won during the quarter. Acquisitions contributed forty one percent growth in order bookings, with the majority coming in food and beverage due to several new programs booked by our CFT businesses. On a trailing twelve month basis, our book to bill ratio was one point one five to one, positioning us well for continued organic revenue growth. Moving to revenues, our Q three top line increased forty-eight percent over Q three last year. Organic growth was 22% due to higher order backlog entering the quarter, as well as year-over-year growth in service and parts revenues. Foreign exchange was a 5% headwind compared to Q3 last year. Acquired companies added 31% to revenue growth, with CFT and SP the primary contributors. Due to seasonality, and as expected, CFT revenues were lower in comparison to Q2. Going forward, CFT is well positioned with a healthy order backlog following a very strong order bookings result in Q three. Our Q three ending backlog of one point five billion dollars was fifty percent higher than Q three last year. Looking forward, our revenue conversion for Q four is estimated to be in the thirty five to forty percent range of order backlog. As a reminder, this estimate is based on revenue expectations for both the execution of projects from backlog and work that will be booked and billed within the quarter. Moving to margins, Q three gross margin included $5.1 million of costs related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired through acquisition activity. Excluding this adjustment, Q3's adjusted gross margin was 29.8%, 200 basis points higher than the cost of the cost of the comparable period a year ago. Higher gross margin reflected operating efficiencies from strong project execution, improvements in the cost structure of our core business through previous reorganizations, increased service revenues, and other continuous improvement efforts achieved by deploying our ABF. Disruptions in supply chain have led to increased lead times and in some cases increases in cost in our supply base. To date, this has not had a material impact on our profitability. Our teams have implemented countermeasures, including advancing order timing and securing alternative sources of supply to mitigate inflationary pressures and lengthening lead times. Even with these countermeasures, supply chain pressures remain dynamic and will continue to present a challenge to our mitigation efforts going forward. Moving to SGNA, expenses were $43.6 million higher than Q3 last year. This year's costs included $16.7 million of acquisition related amortization and $6.3 million of doll acarsquisition related transaction costs. Excluding these items in both periods, Q three's SGNA was seventy nine point nine million dollars, twenty five point nine million higher than last year, reflecting incremental SGNA costs from acquired companies, primarily CFT, Biodot, and SP. Third quarter stock compensation expense was twelve point seven million dollars, up from four point nine million dollars last year. Q three adjusted earnings from operations were seventy point four million or twelve point nine percent compared to forty three point eight million or eleven point eight percent last year. The increase in margin reflected efficiency gains made in our cost structure through effectively implemented reorganizations, improved program execution, and increased after-sale service revenues compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, our core business operated with a 14.3% adjusted earnings from operations margin, up 250 basis points over Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings margins from our acquired businesses were 7.4%. As expected, we saw a sequential reduction in earnings at Biodot as business volumes normalized following a period of higher demand for COVID-related products. As expected, CFT operated at a low single-digit even margin in the third quarter. Actions to improve the cost structure of the business and drive savings through supply chain synergies are underway and on track. In the quarter, supply chain savings were partially offset by increased costs of materials such as stainless steel. We are confident that the ongoing deployment of the ABM at CFT, including core tools such as daily visual management, problem solving, and Kaisen events will drive improvements in the business. As previously announced, we also took action to reorganize certain CFT subsidiaries, including closing two facilities and consolidating product lines. These actions will drive cost efficiencies in line with our plan and bring focus to areas with a stronger value proposition. Restructurs of $4.2 million were incurred in the third quarter. Integration of SP and DF are in the early stages. Our teams are working to achieve identified synergies between our pharma businesses, including ATS Life Sciences, Comach,h andare now with the addition the V S P and D F. Q three adjusted EPS was fifty two cents per share compared to thirty cents per share last year. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in revenues and improved operating margins. Moving to the balance sheet, in Q3 we generated cash from operations of $82.1 million up from $78.9 million last year on growth in revenues and operating margins. Our non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenue remained low at 6.3% in Q3, up slightly from 6% in Q2, and well within our target of maintaining working capital as a percentage of revenues below 15%. We invested $11.3 million in CapEx and intangible assets in Q3, compared to $7 million in Q3 last year. Higher investments, primarily related to the expansion and improvement of facilities and investments in IT. On leverage, our December net debt to adjust the EBITDA ratio was 3.1 to 1 as we drew on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of SP in Q3. As we have said previously, we are willing to temporarily increase our leverage for the right opportunities. On a pro-forma basis, including the trailing 12-month EBITDAC contributions of acquired businesses, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately two point six to one. We ended the quarter with two hundred million dollars of cash and availability on our credit facilities of approximately one hundred and seventy one million. Going forward, we're focused on maintaining our strong balance sheet and flexibility in our financing to continue supporting our growth strategies. In summary, strong growth continued in Q three, including record quarterly revenues, bookings, and backlog, and we pursued margin expansion with good results. These accomplishments reflected organic growth, on-planned contributions from our newly acquired businesses, and the ongoing application of our ABM playbook. Our global teams have demonstrated strong performance in challenging business conditions as we continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Now we will open the call to questions from our analysts. Operator, could you please provide instructions? Thank you. Thank you. You ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question and answer session. To allow as many voices to be heard as possible, please limit yourself to two questions per turn. If you have a question, please press the star followed by the one on your touchstone phone. Your questions will be bold in the ord in the order they're received. Please ensure you leave the handset if you're using a speakerphone before pressing any keys. One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from Cherlene Radbourne with GD Securities. Please go ahead. Um Andrew, as we think about your MA agenda after a very busy twelve months, can you give us a sense of how much white space is left in life sciences for you and where your areas of focus will be going forward. Yeah, good good good morning, Sherilyn. Um so I'm gonna walk through first, really pleased with the progress we've made here. And as we continue to build out our focus on key markets, key areas, we've also increased what we view as as the potential. And so our funnel was healthy and remains healthy in this space. And there are multiple areas we like, as you're well aware. One is in life sciences, and even with the addition of SP, not only do we view biopharma as having additional opportunity, when we look at their life sciences equipment space, it opens up new niche markets that we view have potential for ATS in the future. A couple items to to to highlight, our balance sheet remains strong, but secondly, the cultivation activity that we do today oftentimes will pay off two years from now. So when we look at our strategic layout and our strategic structure, we're constantly focused on how to ensure that we build those relationships. We put us in a position that when an available target becomes available, ATS can win. And as you're well aware, we look at niche applications that are leaders in their spaces, leaders in technology that we can bring together and really provide solutions for our customers. Great. That's great color. Um and then for Ryan, um, your backlog conversion has been above guidance for the last several quarters and I was hoping you could help us understand that. Is that because there are now certain short cycle revenues that aren't factored into the backlog conversion or is the company just continuing to exceed its own expectations for backlog conversion. Um yeah, good morning Sherilyn. So uh so I I'll start. Th this is something that we do look at every quarter and and we base the estimate um on what is in our backlog or expectations and and uh specifically to your question we have added uh faster turning businesses so S P i as a as an example is a quicker turning business. Their projects are generally shorter cycle than than the core ATS business. They also have the labware and glassware business, which is uh a faster turning business. Um in this quarter we were a bit higher than uh that thirty five to forty percent range. Uh just over half of that, about just over one percent was related to SP, which was not part of our business when we provided that range last quarter. So i in the short term, we are dealing with supply chain headwinds. Uh there there's been an uptick in employee absenteeism related to COVID. And so that's led us to keep that rate in that 35 to 40% range. Over time, again to the to your question, given the addition of more products, technologies, uh growth in services, we may see this rate increase, but i in today's environment, uh our our outlook is is in that thirty five to forty percent range. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. That's all from me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Neville with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning guys. Excuse me. Um yeah, another great quarter. Um I guess just I on these supply chain presses, um, again you're calling this out longer lead times, labor, etcetera. Uh I guess I'm just curious, sort of incrementally have things gotten materially worse, um uh or or or not? Um 'cause again we're not really seeing it in the numbers and just trying to sort of gauge what it means for the next quarter or two. Yeah, good good good morning, Mark. Um I'll start then Ryan, feel free to jump in if there's areas you want to add. Um so to to start, we have and and you know I'll just walk through this quickly. We we've really launched our view of the ABM around this and and and it's something we call daily visual management. Effectively what you're doing is you're looking at every business, every site, every area on a daily basis and and you know red or green, do you have an issue or not? And if you have an issue, how do you then resolve that issue and and drive? And so we know from from not only from a regional, from a site specific area at my level across the enterprise. I can pull it weekly, I can pull it you know, daily if needed. What's going on in our supply chain and and what do we really need to drive to assess? And so quite candidly it has gotten worse. And and quite candidly, you know, it is a it is a challenge today, one that we're planning for for for the remainder of the calendar year. Now there's different opinions on when that will call it come back to normal, but our view has been tactically how do we drive impact here? How do we minimize the impact? Additionally, how do we set ourselves up for success in the long term? And so with candidly i i it has increased. Our team continues to perform. It is an area that we are very focused on and we're identifying short term and midterm countermeasures on a daily basis to ensure that we stay ahead of any challenges, uh whether it's supply chain or or general inflation. And I I guess just to follow up sort of on Sherlin's question just around backlog conversion, again, like this your your your guides would sort of capture these supply chain issues um and again sort of anything that you might book and burn in the quarter. Because again it does feel like structurally the business has become sort of a pyre for conversion businesses with recent M and A. Y yeah, so so uh uh i i again, it it'ss th that' a fair comment. Um a and you know, I I I I won't r rehash the the the whole discussion, but um y uh uh as I said, uh as as we add more products tech,nology services, um and S P i is a shorter shorter cycle business and it has more products, I do expect that the rate will continue to increase. But yeah, i in today's environment it's you know, as Andrew just said, it's very dynamic. Um there's there's headwinds in supply chain. Uh there's headwinds still related to to COVID and the re resurgence there. So you know, w we're we're being prudent in in this and and you know I I I think I think that's appropriate. Okay. Um if we're gonna ask a second question, just on M and A. I guess two part question. Um I think sequentially the contribution was down quarter over quarter and I'm guessing that's wild dot and then second question on M and A. Um I mean you've got that base shelf perspective so there maybe just show comments on sort of your thoughts around having that available. Thanks guys. Yeah, so um uh on Biodot, yes, correct. It is it was down in revenues and that that was expected as I said my prepared comments. Um that business had a uh had quite a strong covet tailwind uh related to to a couple of products that that they they offer and we did expect that to normalize. It did happen in the quarter and and the business is is really uh I'd say in line with expectations, but the reality is it's it's still ahead of our expectations in terms of its performance. So so we're very pleased there. Um y your second question I think was on the base shelf filing. So um w we really look at this uh as as a tool and and what what has helped us be successful um in in MA over the past couple of years is is having flexibility and the ability to get a deal done, in in particular without financing conditions. And from a seller's perspective, that takes a lot of of risk out the process. And and so you know as as we're looking forward, we've talked about our growth strategy, MA is a big part of that. We want to have uh continue to have financial flexibility and having this base shelf in place is is an important part of that that uh that flexibility going forward. Got it. Thanks Megas. Thank you. Your next question comes from David Ocampo with CoreMax Securities. Please go ahead. Uh good morning everyone. R Ryan, last quarter y you you provided a uh Since there's a lot of moving parts in in the quarter as it relates to you know acquisitions as well as supply chain issues. I was just wondering where your your base operating margins are right now. Yeah, so so I I I I I did mention this in my prepared remarks, but we we are in the mid fourteen percent range, so uh fourteen point three percent. We we were actually down slightly. We were fourteen four in the prior sequential quarter. Um a and the the the headwind there was was related to stock comp. It was about a thirty to forty basis point uh impact on our core margins, um our gross margin and uh in in in in operating margins were both ahead excluding Stock Comp. Um and then the acquisitions uh were in the the high single-digit range, seven and a half percent. And I talked through the different components there, but just to r to reiterate, so CFT has uh historically been at a low single-digit even margin and they continue to be in line there. So you know we've made progress, some of the some of the day one costs that we expected have come out. We've had some early wins in supply chain. Now again, there's there's other areas in supply chain, for example, commodities, and I mentioned stainless steel. They're a large consumer of that, and that's an area where we do have more of a challenge to offset those cost increases. So they're performing to plan. The restructuring we announced will further help with their cost and oper andating efficiencies. Um the other big piece of of our acquisition margins was Biodot. And I talked about um you know that's been a a very strong performer for us, really driven by the some of those COVID tailwinds and we did see that as I said normalize in the quarter. And so their margins are still accretive to to our overall margins, but they did come down relative to Q2. Yeah. now between internal equipment versus third party equipment that you guys are using for I guess the in the entirety of your sales? Uh so it it it it hasn't really changed. It's still in that it's still in that forty percent range. W which is typically where it's been. It it it it ranges a little bit, forty to forty five, but it's it's still in that forty percent range. That's forty percent internal, right? Uh yes, correct. And and do you guys have a a target on where that's David, sorry, I I misunderstood your question. That's forty percent is third party uh equipment. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen as a reminder should you have any questions please press star one. Your next question comes from Justin Keywood with SEFL G MP. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Uh thanks for taking my call and nice to see the continued strength in the business. On the organic growth, uh it was uh strong again at twenty one point five percent. I'm wondering if we just take a step back and uh if you could describe some of the factors driving that organic growth uh across the different segments and and how you see organic growth playing out in uh the near term and uh medium term. Um you know sure. Good morning Justin. No uh so I'll I'll characterize this at the top level but I'll go into specifics. So if we look at the markets, we generally state the markets are are are favorable and and good. And then if we look at our funnel as I mentioned, our funnel remains solid. I then I then you know would would be remiss to to not add in the operating environment, which we would say is challenging and and we would say not only, you know, from a from a supply chain but also when you look at the pandemic impact. So so it is a challenging environment, but our teams continue to perform and continue to drive. Then if I step into each segment and and I did talk a bit about this in the prepared remarks, but to add a little additional color, you know life sciences, uh when we look at this this area, it's largely compiled comprised of of non covet opportunities now. And and you know, things do get a little bit blurry in that, you know, vaccine rollout and as we get more biopharma, more more pharma, it really does impact whether it's that or new drugs or new discoveries. But but that market, you know, call it year to date growth is roughly fifteen percent. This quarter was a little more impacted by some delays in in in elective surgeries. And so we did see some impact this quarter, but as we look at our year to date number, we still see this as a solid market and and one that provides opportunities for the future. The funnel remains healthy here. In EV, look, we're seeing activity uh continue to pick up and and we booked a large award within the quarter and we continue to work with uh with a new customer in Europe. Uh and and and you know as you look at the stricter emissions and you look at the the the the focus on driving this in in that sector in that space, we do view that we are positioned well to help our customers through that and we do view this as an area that we can continue to support and drive growth within our solution set, within our technology, within within our clock value within the within the market. Consumer, we saw good activity in warehouse automation and and we are seeing uh s some some pickup in in in the cosmetic space. As a matter of fact, uh I recently visited a customer in this area and it was fascinating because this customer specifically walked through their model, their business with me where so they're they're impacted by by by a reduced sunscreen because of the limited travel, but yet their home care products have have have skyrocketed and and skyrocketed to them was a big number but, but I don't reference what that number is. And so we have seen that market start to come back and we have seen, you know, the funnel really align with that. And and then, you know, to round this out, uh our food business. Um you know when we think about primary processing, you know, and think think uh tomato to to initial processing, so so from vine to puree was a solid quarter. And you know w we are seeing a bit of an uptick there and and and and a favorable setup for the the the harvest season that's coming up. Energy, uh you know I I I mentioned this in in in in the announcement in in the update, you know, this this continues to be a strong market for us, continues to be an area that we view we can offer high value for our customer base. We're continuing to look at at opportunities to expand a niche application to ensure that it's high value in the markets we serve. And lastly, boy, you know, our our services team continues to execute and and if you look at, you know, versus prior quarter and and year over year, the the growth that they've seen. And you know, it's this is an interesting one and and one to highlight where even in my tenure here, this has gone from a nice to have to a str strategic imperative for our customers where when they when they came to us in the beginning it was, Well, do you have services and ca what can you offer and going through. Now it's because of the pandemic, because of the supply chain disruptions, because of you know machine dependency and or turnover, they're looking at our services organization as a key enabler. And so when companies and and and customers in say the UK went down and went on lockdown, ATS could still execute, ATS could still provide that value because we launched digital tools, because we had the regional service network. And so I truly think this has been an enabler for us to keep driving share and and driving that value for our customers. And so overall I would say to get back to my initial point, generally favorable in the markets, positive, and and our funnel remains healthy and aligned around it. Uh but the operating environment is challenging. Thank you. Very helpful context and uh good to hear the new EV customer win in uh Europe. Just on the services growth that you mentioned, uh what was that in the quarter? And just to provide some context, if we look at aftermarket services as a percentage of sales, what was that prior to the pandemic or a couple of years ago? What is it today and what would be the long term target for that area? So uh in terms of uh after sales services as a percentage of revenues. Uh it's it's mid to high teens today, so it's been in the a and it's while it's grown, the the rest of our business has grown too. So uh it it's it's had to keep up which which it has. Um you know, a few years ago i and I don't have the data i in front of me, but if we went back four or five years it would have been in the low teens, maybe ten, twelve percent. So it it's it's it' itss growth has outpaced um the the equipment side of the business, which which we view as a as as very positive and in much for the reasons that Andrew just outlined. And uh one other item that that I would just uh want to highlight as well is is the growth in our digital solutions around whether it's Illuminate or or what what PA's doing in in their business to really provide not only data collection, but then utilizing the data to then bring back in a solution set that helps customers improve their process. And so we have seen that be a real call it bright spot in growth, but it's still relatively small across the you know the total business, but we do view that as an area of growth for our organization and one we can help our customers as they navigate this this time. That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. Your next question comes from Maxime Chichiv with National Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Max. Morning. Um Andrew, maybe just the the first question for you. Um in terms of you know how we think about uh uh M and A and and the timing of it, how do you balance uh that dynamic with uh obviously the need to properly integrate um especially SP which was a pretty sizable transaction. So d do you mind maybe just walking us through your thought process there? Uh yeah, and and and and Max, there's there's no perfect answer here. What I can walk you through is we've developed an integration playbook. It's it's very standard around how we operate and how we s walk into businesses and and you know, as you are well aware, when we look at an acquisition, we have four criteria and you know, it's markets, it's it's strategic rationale. One of them is is is the management assessment and and their ability to align around the ABM. And so we do assess that going in and then ultimately in the early days of the integration you start to align around where they are in their journey and and and where do we need to press, where do we need to, you know, help in that solution set. So we have a very good indication when we acquire a business of where they are in that journey and and and where we can help. And so what I can tell you is we have built out our capability and our ability within our leadership team to be able to align and and continue to build out their portfolio of solutions. We are selective in in in what we are going to add and we look at it from a value creation perspective, both from a shareholder and a customer perspective, from what we can offer whether it's technology or solutions. And as you're well aware, the cultivation activity, while you know I I will say it often, oftentimes will will will play out two, three, four years from now. And so uh we are not slowing down this activity. We do view that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to add here, but we're gonna be extremely disciplined. And so to answer your question head on, we have built our capability among our team. We certainly are are taking and ensuring that we have a key focus on SP to execute, to ensure that they meet and exceed our expectations. And then lastly, we're not slowing down our cultivation and and we're going to continue in the areas that we view are going to add value over over the long term for ATS. Okay, that makes a lot of s sense. Thank you for that. And then just one quick follow up on on S P. Um in terms of the ability to cross sell their consumer bills business, do you mind maybe just providing some data points there? Because my understanding is that uh I think most of the sales process there is going through distributors. And I'm just curious to see how you think about sort of leveraging that potential business into the rest of the ATS i if it's possible. So so Max, uh you know, I I I think just to confirm, you're asking about the labware glassware business. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so so so we we we certainly uh you know we did a lot of diligence to understand this space and and the stickiness with with their you know, call it Bell Art portfolio as well as the the other areas uh within that within that space and you know w we view this as as a as a as a business that you know while it's low single digits it's it's a it's a market that has consistent continued revenue and and when we think about the consistency there it's one one we like from a standpoint of of their, we don't want to call it consumable, but their recurring revenue and and their approach around the the brand being a strong brand and the markets they serve. And so it does go through distribution. Uh it's an area that that we certainly see you know value in continuing to to help them execute their plan. Uh does it help sell biopharma processing equipment? Uh we think it's an potential adder, but but it is not call it would not draw that that total processing equipment in. We would view the alignment with Comacher to IDOC Techno to to Hull as really being the the thesis and the alignment on the biopharmacy biopharma processing piece. And then, you know, to round this out, they've got Genovac and life sciences equipment and and FTS and and and there's a lot to like around those those areas of of what we can have from a from an ATS, coma chair, SP integration to to offer that full process solution, whether it's biopharma or or pharma processing. Okay. Okay. Great. Um well we will conclude and and you know if I step back, we're pleased with the performance this quarter and recognize the hard work and dedication of our teams across ATS that made this possible. Thank you for joining us. I look forward to speaking to you on our Q4 call in May. Stay safe and goodbye for now.",

We note that our remarks today are accompanied by slide deck displayed on the screen in the webcast and which is also available including for those joining by phone at atsautomation.com. We caution that the statements made on the webcast and call may contain forward-looking information and our cautionary statement regarding such information including the material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements, and the material factors or assumptions applied in making the statements are detailed on slide two of the slide deck. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Stewart. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another strong quarter for ATS, featuring order bookings, order backlog, and revenue records, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion. Although, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions created a challenging and fluid business environment. Organic revenue growth was robust. Newly acquired businesses performed to plan, and we completed two acquisitions. SP industries expands our capabilities and offerings throughout the lifecycle of pharmaceutical development. GF enhances our offerings and aseptic fill finish. Today, I will update you on our business, and then Ryan will provide his financial report. Starting with our value drivers, Q3 revenues were $547 million, up 48% from Q3 last year. Driven by a combination of acquired businesses and strength across our core operations. Organically, revenues grew 22% year over year, a positive result that was augmented by the pandemic impact and Q3 revenues in the prior year. Q3 order bookings will record $671 million. Up 54% year over year. CFT BioDot and SP contributed approximately two thirds of border booking's growth versus last year. Bookings were strong across most market verticals, with large customer rewards and consumer products and transportation. Our adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter was 12.9%, representing margin expansion of over 100 basis points from Q3 of last year. Moving to our outlook, our backlog grew to a record $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter, providing us with a solid base of business and good revenue visibility. The pandemic situation remains fluid, and we continue to work with our customers and employees to manage the challenges, including newly imposed travel restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and supply chain interruptions. Despite the challenges, our teams have done an excellent job to ensure customer needs are met. By market, conditions remain positive in life sciences with good activity in our key sectors of medical devices, pharma and radio-pharma. Today, our funnel is comprised of more traditional, non- COVID related opportunities. In EBIT, we continue to see robust activity levels with rapid growth in the battery assembly market. We won several mandates during the quarter, including a large award from a repeat customer. As our customers experience new complexities from evolving battery technologies, our long track record and proven expertise in the battery assembly and test space position ATS as a trusted partner. In food and beverage, our order funnel remains strong, with opportunities and food processing leading the way. In consumer, we're seeing continued activity in warehouse automation. In energy, the market for automated tools and related services for nuclear refurbishment is expanding. The decommissioning market also continues to evolve, and we see prospects in both North America and globally. There are also emerging opportunities in isotope production and small modular reactor markets, as well as grid batteries. On services, order bookings grew both year over year and sequentially. Utilization and expansion of our regional service network coupled with the use of digital support tools have improved our ability to support our customers. In turn, our customers continue to embrace our digital services platform. We see opportunities to expand our aftermarket services footprint and add to our digital capabilities. Operationally, we faced a challenging business environment resulting from global supply chain issues and the pandemic. We've experienced some supplier lead time extensions, and our team has completed several related problem-solving events. These challenges are likely to persist in the near term. To summarize our outlook, this quarter included record order bookings, record order backlog, and a robust funnel. We're encouraged by recent activity levels. However, global supply chain and labor market dynamics represent a challenge and uncertainty. The situation is actively monitored and countermeasures implemented wherever possible. Moving to the ABM, our continuous improvement playbook. This was another busy quarter, with continued emphasis on improving our value drivers, both operationally and commercially. Our linear motion business held the Kaizen to remove waste from a critical assembly process. The Kaizen resulted in a 50% reduction in force base, lower inventory requirements, and a 20% improvement in cycle time. A Life Sciences Division held the Kaizen on their spare parts order processing. Through collaborative efforts, they were able to improve efficiency by 50%. Our services business held a joint Kaizen with a customer to define requirements for a turnkey training, execution, and spare parts management program. These joint efforts are a great way to provide value to our customers, while also strengthening our relationships. We continue to employ our global virtual ABM Bootcamps on the back of similar successful events and proceeding quarters. The camp runs over a six week period and combined self-paced learning and real-time discussions with ABM leaders. This modified virtual format enables us to continue scaling our training and demonstrates how businesses across ATS use the ABM to drive tangible results. On M&A, acquisitions and strategic core markets continue to be an important complement to ATS's organic growth. During the quarter, we closed two acquisitions, SP being the largest in ATS history. SP as a designer and manufacturer of high grade biopharma processing equipment, life sciences equipment, and lab apparatus products. SP expands our life sciences capabilities and offerings through the addition of its aseptic and non-aseptic inaudible portfolio. Notably, the combination of ATS and SP will allow us to better support the needs of our customers throughout the lifecycle of pharmaceutical development, and production. After deploying capital to these latest acquisitions, our balance sheet remains strong. We will continue to cultivate and evaluate acquisition opportunities consistent with our proven strategy. Of course, timing of acquisitions will be variable, and our approach deploying our balance sheet will be disciplined and strategic, as well the integrations that follow. Of note, we continue to make progress in the integration of previous acquisitions, including CFT, which was acquired last March, BioDot, acquired in June, and NCC, which joined in September. At BioDot, administrative tasks associated with the integration are largely complete, and our efforts are focused on continuing to deploy the ABM playbook. At CFT, we continue to roll out the ATS business model focused on opportunities to further synergies in our supply chains and cost structures, and completed several ABM activities. These included standard work events, a raw material problem-solving event, and a communication Kaizen, which drove increased awareness and engagement across the business. AT ATs, our innovation activities are ongoing as they form part of our expand strategy. In the past quarter, we have completed a number of projects and initiatives that have resulted in the launch of a new high-speed debug camera, GMP testing, and certification of our super track pharma product, and the development of a new energy management software program that will enable customers to track and reduce their carbon footprint. We're pleased that our acquired company are also innovators. At the recent Chicago Process Ex- Expo, our NCC business won the Innovation Award for the sanitary design of the NCC side drive conveyance system. We have filed a patent for this system, which has multiple applications, including raw and packaged food products. Congratulations to the whole NCC team, well done. In summary, the results of the quarter and year to date demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business and portfolio offerings. Record order booking activity reflects the alignment we have with our customers in providing best-in class solutions. Going forward, we are unwavering in our commitment to protecting and engaging our employees, serving our customers well and creating value for our shareholders. We will execute on these priorities through the application of the ABM playbook, with a goal… produced through the application of the ABM playbook with the goal of driving continuous improvement in our performance. Our record order backlog provides good revenue visibility, while the healthy balance sheet enables pursuit of organic growth and strategic M&A opportunities. Our objective is to build a great ATS business and we're making progress every day towards our collective goal. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan, over to you. Thank you, Andrew. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen this morning, I will provide an overview of our Q3 operating results that featured growth and revenues both year over year in and sequentially, adjusted EBIT margin expansion and record order bookings and backlog. I will then review our balance sheet, which we have deployed strategically to expand our customer capabilities and earnings potential. Starting with operating results, bookings were $671 million up 54% compared to Q3 last year. Organic growth in bookings was 18%, partially offset by a 5% headwind from foreign exchange translation. Organic growth came from transportation as a result of new and follow on work in EV, energy markets due to follow on work and consumer products due to a large customer program, one during the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 41% growth in order bookings with the majority coming in food and beverage due to several new programs booked by our CFT businesses. An a trailing 12 month basis, our book to bill ratio was 1.15 to one, positioning us well for continued organic revenue growth. Moving to revenues, our Q3 top line increased 48% over Q3 last year. Organic growth was 22% due to higher order backlog entering the quarter, as well as year over year growth in service and parts revenues. Foreign exchange was a 5% headwind compared to Q3 last year. Acquired companies added 31% to revenue growth with CFT and SP the primary contributors. Due to seasonality and as expected, CFT revenues were lower in comparison to Q2, going forward, CFT is well positioned with a healthy order backlog following a very strong order bookings result in Q3. Our Q3 ending backlog of 1.5 billion was 50% higher than Q3 last year. Looking forward, our revenue conversion for Q4 is estimated to be in the 35 to 40% range of order backlog. As a reminder, this estimate is based on revenue expectations for both the exit execution of projects from backlog and work that will be booked and billed within the quarter. Moving to margins, Q3 gross margin included 5.1 million of cost related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired through acquisition activity. Excluding this adjustment, Q's adjusted gross margin was 29.8%, 200 basis points higher than the comparable period a year ago. Higher gross margin reflected operating efficiencies from strong project execution, improvements in the cost structure of our core business through previous reorganizations, increased service revenues and other continuous improvement efforts achieved by deploying our ABF. Disruptions and supply chain have led to increase lead times and in some cases, increases in cost in our supply base. To date, this has not had a material impact on our profitability. Our teams have implemented countermeasures, including advancing order timing and securing alternative sources of supply to mitigate inflationary pressures and lengthening lead times. Even with these countermeasures, supply chain pressures remain dynamic and will continue to present a challenge to or mitigation efforts going forward. Moving to SG&A, expenses were 43.6 million higher than Q3 last year. This year's costs included 16.7 million of acquisition related amortization and 6.3 million of acquisition related transaction costs. Excluding these items in both periods, Q'3 threes SG&A was 79.9 million, 25.9 million higher than last year. Reflecting incremental SG&A costs from acquired companies, primarily CFT, BioDot, and SP. Third quarter stock compensation expense was 12.7 million up from 4.9 million last year. Q3 adjusted earnings from operations were 70.4 million or 12.9% compared to 43.8 million or 11.8% last year. The increase in margin reflected efficiency gains made in our cost structure through effectively implemented reorganizations, improved program execution and increased after sale service revenues compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, our core business operated with a 14.3% adjusted earnings from operations margin, up 250 basis points of our Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings margins from our acquired businesses were 7.4%. As expected, we saw a sequential reduction in earnings BioDot, as business volumes normalized following a period of higher demand for COVID related products. As expected, CFT operated at a low single digit even margin in the third quarter, actions to improve the cost structure of the business and drive savings through supply chain synergies are underway and on track. In the quarter, supply chain savings were partially offset by increased cost of materials, such as stainless steel. We are confident that the ongoing deployment of the ABM at CFT, including core tools such as daily visual management, problem solving and Kaiser events will drive improvements in the business. As previously announced, we also took action to reorganize certain CFT subsidiaries, including closing two facilities and consolidating product lines. These actions will drive cost efficiencies in line with our plan and bring focus to areas with a stronger value proposition. Restruction costs of 4.2 million were incurred in the third quarter. Integration of SP and DF are in the early stages. Our teams are working to achieve identified synergies between our pharma businesses, including ATS Life Sciences, Coma Chair, and now with the addition to SP and DF. Q3 adjusted EPS was 52 cents per share compared to 30 cents per share last year. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in revenues and improved operating margins. Moving to the balance sheet, in Q3 we generated cash from operations of $82.1 million up from 78.9 million last year on growth and revenues and operating margins. Our non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenue remained low at 6.3% in Q3, up slightly from 6% in Q2 and well within our target of maintaining working capitals of percentage of revenues below 15%. We invested 11.3 million in CapEx and intangible assets in Q3 compared to seven million in Q3 last year. Higher investments, primarily related to the expansion and improvement of facilities and investments in IT. On leverage, our December net debt to adjust EBITDA ratio was 3.1 to one as we drew on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of SP in Q3. As we've said previously, we are willing to temporarily increase our leverage for the rate opportunities. And a proforma basis, including the trailing 12 month EBITDA contributions of acquired businesses, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.6 to one. We ended the quarter with 200 million of cash and availability on our credit facilities of approximately 171 million. Going forward, we're focused on maintaining our strong balance sheet and flexibility into our financing to continue supporting our growth strategies. In summary, strong growth continued in Q3, including record quarterly revenues, bookings and backlog, and we pursued margin expansion with good results. These accomplishments reflected organic growth on plan contributions from our newly acquired businesses and the ongoing application of our ABM playbook. Our global teams have demonstrated strong performance in challenging business conditions, as we continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Now, we will open the call questions from our analysts, operator, could you please provide instructions? Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, who will now conduct a question and answer session. To allow as many voices to be heard as possible, please limit yourself to two questions per turn. If you have a question, please press the star followed by the one on your touch inaudible phone. Your questions be pulled in the, in the order they received. Please ensure you leave the handset if you're using a speaker phone before pressing any keys. One moment please for your first question, your first question comes from Charlene Raborn, GD Securities, please go ahead. Thanks very much. And good morning. Um, Andrew, as we think about your M&A agenda after a very busy 12 months, can you give us a sense of how much white space is left in life sciences for you and where your areas of focus will be going forward? Yeah. Good, good, good morning, Charlene. Um, so I'm gonna walk through first, really pleased with the progress we've made here. And as we continue to build out, our focus on key markets, key areas, we've also increased what we view as, as the potential. And so our funnel was healthy and remains healthy in this space. And there are multiple areas we like as you're well aware, one is in life sciences. And even with the addition of, of SP, not only do we view bio pharma as having additional opportunity, when we look at their life sciences equipment space, it opens up new niche markets that we view have potential for ATS in the future. Couple items to, to, to highlight, our balance sheet remains strong. But secondly, the cultivation activity that we do today oftentimes will pay off two years from now. So when we look at our strategic layout and our strategic structure, we're constantly focused on how to ensure that we build those relationships. We put us in a position that when an available target becomes available, ATS can win. And as you're well aware, we look at niche applications that are leaders in their spaces, leaders in technology that we can bring together and really provide solutions for our customers. Great. That's great color. Um, and then for Ryan, um, your backlog conversion has been above guidance for the last several quarters, and I was hoping you could help us understand that, is that because there are now certain short cycle revenues that aren't factored into the backlog conversion? Or is the company just continuing to exceed its own expectations for backlog conversion? Um, yeah, good morning, Charlene. So, so I, I'll start, th- this is something that we do look, uh, at every quarter and we base the estimate, um, on what is in our backlog or expectations. And, uh, specifically to your question, we have added, uh, faster turning businesses. So SP is a, as an example is a quicker… Does this… so, S-SP is-is-is-is an example, is a quick returning business. Other projects are generally shorter cycle than, than the core ATS business. They also have the lab ware and glassware business, which is uh-uh, a fast returning business. Um, in, in this quarter we were a bit higher than, uh, that 35-40 % range. That… just over half of that, just over 1% was related to SP, which was not part of our business when we provided that range last quarter. Um, so, in, in the short term, we are dealing with supply chain headwinds, uh, there-there, there's been an uptick in employee absenteeism related to Covid. And so, that's led us to keep that rate in that 35-40 % range. Over time, again, to the, to your question, given the addition of more products, technologies, uh, growth in services. We may see this rate increase, but i-in today's environment, uh, our, our outlook is, is in that 35-40 % range. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. That's all from me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Neville, with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning guys. <cough> 'Scuse me. Uh, another great quarter. Um, I guess just, just on these supply chain presses, um, again you're calling these out longer lead times, labor, et cetera. Uh, I guess I'm just curious, sort of incrementally, have things gotten materially worse? Um, or, or, or, or not? Again we're not really seeing it in the numbers, I'm just kinda sorta gauge what it means for the next quarter inaudible. Yeah, good, good, good morning Mark. Um, I'll start then Ryan feel free to jump in if there's areas you wanna add. Um, so, to, to start… we have and, and, I'll just walk through this quickly. We, we, we've really launched our view of the ABM around this and, and, and it's something we call daily visual management. Um, effectively, what you're doing is you're looking at every business, every site, every area, on a daily basis. And, and you know better green, do you have an issue or not? And if you have an issue, how do you then resolve it that issue and drive? And so, we know from, from not only a regional, from a site-specific area. At my level, across the enterprise, I can pull up weekly, I can pull up, you know, daily, if needed, what's going on in our supply chain and what do we really need to drive to assess? And so, quite candidly it has gotten worse. And, and quite candidly you know, it is a, it is a challenge today, one that we're planning for, for, for the remainder of the calendar year. Now, there's different opinions on when that will, call it, come back to 'normal', but our view has been tactically how do we drive impact here? How do we minimize the impact? Additionally, how do we set ourselves up for success in the long-term? And so, candidly, it, it, it has increased. Our team continues to perform. It is an area we are very focused on and we're identifying short-term and midterm countermeasures on a daily basis to ensure that we stay ahead of any challenges, uh, whether it's supply chain or, or general inflation. That, that, that's helpful. And, and I guess, to follow up on, sort of inaudible's question as to round inaudible conversion. Again like, this, you're- you're guidance would sort of capture the supply chain issues, um, and again, sort of anything that you might book and burn in the quarter. Because again, it does feel like structurally the business has become sort of a higher, or conversion business with recent inaudible. Yea, so, so, it, again-it- it's that-that's a fair comment um, and-and-and, you know, I-I-I won't, I won't rehash the-the-the whole discussion but um, as-as-as-as I said, as-as-we add more products, technology services um, and SP in-in the shorter, shorter cycle business and it has more products, I do expect that the rate will continue to increase but yeah, in-in, in today's environment it's you know, as Andrew just said, it's very dynamic. Um, there's, there's headwinds in supply chain. Uh, there's headwinds still related to, to Covid and the resurgence there. So, you know, we- we're you know being prudent in-in-in this. And, and, you know I-I-I think, I think that's appropriate. Okay. Um I was going to ask a second question. I'm going to, I guess just keep our question um, I wouldn't… sequentially population was down quarter for quarter and I'm guessing that's bio-dot inaudible and then second question I'm gonna… Um, we got the base shell perspective so maybe this inaudible comments or some of your thoughts are inaudible available, thanks guys. Yeah, so um, on Bio-dot, yes, correct it is, it was down in revenues. And, and, that, that was expected as I said in my prepared comments. Um, that business had a, had quite a strong covid tailwind uh related to, to a couple of products that, that they offer. And we did expect that to normalize, it did happen in the quarter and, and in the business, is-is-is really… It's in line with expectations, but the reality is, is it's still ahead of our expectations in terms of its performance. So, so we're very pleased there. Um, your second question was I think on the bay shelf filing, so, um, We really look at this, as-as-as a tool and-and-what-what has helped us be successful um, in MNA over the past couple of years is, is having flexibility and the ability to get a deal done. In-in particular with our financing conditions. And from a seller's perspective that takes a lot of risk out of the process. And-and so, as we're looking forward we talked about our growth strategy, MNA is a big part of that. We want to have uh, continue to have financial flexibility and, having this bay shelf in place is, is an important part of that, that, that, uh flexibility going forward. Got it. Thanks inaudible guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from David Okampo with Core-Mac Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, Good morning everyone. Ryan, last quarter, you, you provided a uh, I guess organic operating margins for, for the base business. Since there's a lot of moving parts in, in the quarter as it relates to you know, acquisitions as well as supply chain issues… I was just wondering where your base operating margins are right now? Yeah, so, I, I, I, did mention this in my prepared remarks but we, we are in the mid 14% range so uh, 14.3%. We were actually down slightly, we were down 14.4 in the prior sequential quarter. Um, and-and-and the-the headwind there was related to stock comp. It was about a 30-40 basis point uh, impact on our core margins. Um, our growth margin and uh, in-in-in-and operating margins were both ahead excluding stock comp. Um, and-and then the acquisitions were in the-the high single digit range, 7 and a half percent. And I talked through the different components there but just to-to reiterate, so CFT has uh historically been at a low single digit even margin and they continue to be in line there, so um, you know, we've made progress… Some of the, some of the day 1 costs uh, that we've expected have come out, um, we've had some early winds in supply chain… Now again, there's-there's other areas in supply chain for example, commodities, and I mentioned in uh, stainless steel uh, they're a large consumer of that. And, and that scenario where we do have more of a challenge to offset those cost increases. Um, so, so they're performing to plan. The restructuring we announce will further uh, help with their costs and operating efficiencies. Um, the other big piece of, of, our acquisition margins was bio-dot and I talked about um, you know, that's been a very strong performer for us, really driven by some of those Covid tailwinds. And we did see that, as I said, normalize in the quarter. And-and so their margins are still accretive to our overall margins. Uh, but they did come down relative to Q2. And, and you guys, did note that uh, product sale is becoming a bigger piece of your business here in-in-in the release, but I was just curious, what-what what's the split now between internal equipment versus third party equipment that you guys are using for, I guess the entirety of your sales? Uh, so it-it-it hasn't really changed it's still in that, it's still in that 40% range, which is typically where it's been. It-it ranges a little big, 40 to 45 but it's still in that 40% range. That's 40% internal right? Uh, yes, correct. And, and do you guys have a target on where that– Sorry, sorry, David sorry, I misunderstood your question. That's 40% is third party equipment. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman as a reminder, should you have any questions please press * 1. Your next question comes from Justin Keywood with Chief GMB. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Nice to see the continued strength and the business. On the organic growth, uh, it was uh, strong inaudible at 21.5%. I'm wondering if we just take a step back and uh, if you could describe some of the factors driving that organic growth… uh, across the different segments and, and how do you see organic growth playing out in uh, the near term and uh, medium term? Um, you know, sure. Good morning Justin. So, I'll characterize this at the top level, but I'll go into specifics. So if we look at the markets we generally state the markets are, are, are favorable and good. And then if you look at our funnel as I mentioned, our funnel remains solid. I then, I then, you know, would, would, be remiss to not add in the operating environment, which we say is challenging. And, and, we would say not only you know, from a, from a supply chain but also when you look at the pandemic impact. So, so it is a challenging environment but our teams continued to perform. They continued to thrive. Then if I step into each segment, and I did talk a bit about this in the prepared remarks but to add a little additional color. Like sciences, uh, when we-we look at this area, it- it's largely compris-comprised of-of non-covid opportunities now and, and you know, things do you know get a little bit blurry in that, you know that vaccine rollout and-and as we get more bio-pharma, more, more pharma, it really does impact whether it's that or new drugs or new discoveries. But-but that market, call it year-to-date growth is roughly 15%. This quarter was a little more impacted by some delays in-in-in elective surgeries and so we did see some impact this quarter. But as we look at our year-to-date number we still see this as a solid market, and-and one that provides opportunities for the future. The funnel remains healthy here. In EV, look, we're seeing activity uh, continue to pickup. Uh, and-and we booked a larger ward within the quarter. We, uh, continue to pick up and, and we booked a large award within the quarter and we continue to work with, uh, with a new customer in Europe. Uh, and, and, and, you know, as you look at the stricter emissions and you look at the, the, the focus on driving this and in that sector, in that space, we do view that we are positioned well to help our customers through that. And we do view this as an area that we can continue to support and drive growth within our solution set, within our technology, within, within our core value within the, within the market. Consumer, we saw good activity, uh, in warehouse automation. And, and we are seeing, uh, some, some pickup in, in, in the cosmetic space. As a matter of fact, uh, I recently visited a customer in this area, and it was fascinating because this customer specifically walked through their model, their business with me, where they said that they're impacted by, by, by a reduced sunscreen because of the limited travel, but yet their home care products have, have, have skyrocketed. And, and sky racking to them was a big number, but, but I don't reference what that number is. And so we have seen that market start to come back and we have seen, you know, the funnel really align with that. And, and then, you know, to round this out, uh, our food business, um, you know, when we think about primary processing, you know, and think, think, uh, tomato to, to initial processing. So, so to, you know, from buying to puree was a solid quarter. And, you know, we are seeing a bit of an uptick there and, and, and, and a favorable setup for the, the, the harvest season that's coming up. Energy, uh, you know, I, I, I mentioned this in, in, in the announcement, in the update, you know, this, this continues to be a strong market for us, continues to be an area that we view we can offer high value for our customer base. We're continuing to look at, at opportunities to expand a niche application, to ensure that it's high value in the markets we serve. And lastly, boy, you know, our, our services team continues to execute. And, and if you look at, you know, versus prior quarter in, in year to year, the growth that they've seen. And, you know, it's, this is an interesting one and, and one to highlight where even in my tenure here, this has gone from a nice to have, to a str- strategic imperative for our customers. Where, when they, when they came to us from the beginning, it was, well, do you have services? And ca- what can you offer in going through? Now, it's because of the pandemic, because of the supply chain disruptions, because of, you know, machine dependency and or turnover, they're looking at our services organization as a key enabler. And so when companies and, and customers in say, the UK went down and went on lockdown, ATS could still execute. ATS could still provide that inaudible because we launched digital tools, because we had the regional service network. And so I truly think this has been an enabler for us to keep driving share and, and driving that value for our customers. And so overall I would say, to get back to my initial point, generally favorable in the markets, positive and, and our funnel remains healthy and aligned around it. Uh, but the operating environment is challenging. Thank you very helpful context and, uh, good to hear the new EV customer when in, uh, Europe. Just on the services growth that you mentioned, uh, what was that in the quarter? And just to provide some context, if we look at aftermarket services as a percentage of sales, what was that prior to the pandemic or a couple of years ago? What is it today and what would be the long term target for that area? So, uh, in terms of, uh, after sales services as a percentage of revenues, it's, it's mid to high teens today. So it's been in the, and it's, while it's grown, the, the rest of our business has grown too. So, uh, it, it's, it's had to keep up which, which it has. Um, you know, a few years ago and I don't have the data in front of me, but we went back four or five years. It would've been than the low teen, maybe 10, 12%. So it, it's, it's, its growth has outpaced, um, the, the equipment side of the business, which, which we view as, as, as very positive and, and much for the reasons that Andrew just outlined. One other item that, that I would just, uh, wanna highlight as well as, is, is a growth in our digital solutions around whether it's Illuminate or, or what, what PA's doing and in their business to really provide not only data collection, but then utilizing the data to then bring back in a solution set that helps customers improve their process. And so we have seen that be a real call it, bright spot and growth, but it's still relatively small across the, you know, the total business. But we do view that as an area of growth for our organization and one we can help our customers as they navigate this, this time. That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. Your next question comes from Maxim Chichi with National Bank, please go ahead. Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Max. Morning. Um, Andrew, maybe just the, the first question for you, um, in terms of, you know, how we think about, uh, uh, M&A and, and the timing of it, how do you balance, uh, that dynamic with, uh, obviously the need to properly integrate, um, especially SP which was a pretty sizable transaction. So do you mind me just walking us through your thought process there? Uh, yeah. And, and, and, and Max, there's, there's no perfect answer here. What I can walk you through is we've developed an integration playbook. It's, it's very standard around how we operate and how we walk into businesses. And, and, you know, as you are well aware, when we look at an acquisition, we have four criteria and, you know, it's markets, it's, it's strategic rationale. One of them is, is, is the management assessment and, and their ability to align around the ABM. And so we do assess that going in. And then ultimately in the early days of the integration, you start to align around where they are in their journey and, and, and where do we need to press, where do we need to, you know, help in that solution set? So we have a very good indication when we acquire a business of where they are in that journey and, and, and where we help. And so what I can tell you is, we have built out our capability and our ability within our leadership team to be able to align and, and continue to build out their portfolio of solutions. We are selective in, in, in what we are going to add. And we look at it from a value creation perspective both from a shareholder and a customer perspective, from what we can offer, whether it's technology or solutions. And as you're well aware, the cultivation activity, while, you know, I, I will say it often, oftentimes, will, will, will play out two, three, four years from now. And so, uh, we are not slowing down this activity. We do view that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to add here, but we're gonna be extremely disciplined. And so to answer your question, head on, we have built our capability among our team. We certainly are taking and ensuring that we have a key focus on SP to execute, to ensure they meet and exceed our expectations. And then lastly, we're not slowing down our cultivation and, and we're gonna continue in the areas that we view are gonna add value over, over the long term for ATS. Okay. That makes a lot of, uh, sense. Thank you for that. And then just one quick follow up on, on SP. Um, in terms of the ability to cross fill their consumable business, do you mind maybe just providing some data points there? Because my understanding is that, uh, I think most of the sales process there is going through distributors. And I'm just curious to see how you think about sort of leveraging that potential business into the rest of the ATS, if, if it's possible. So, so Max, you know, I, I think, just to confirm, you're asking about the lab ware, glassware business? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so we, we certainly, uh, you know, we did a lot of diligence to understand this space and, and the stickiness with, with their, you know, call it, bell art portfolio, as well as the, the other areas, uh, within that, within that space. And, you know, we view this as, as a, as a, as a business that, you know, while it's low single digits, it's, it's a, it's a market that has consistent continued revenue. And, and when we think about the consistency there, it's one, one we like from a standpoint of, of their, we don't want to call it consumable, but their reoccurring revenue and, and their approach around the, the brand being a strong brand in the markets they serve. And so it does go through distribution. Uh, it's an area that, that we certainly see, you know, value in continuing to, to help them execute their plan. Uh, does it help sell bio pharma processing equipment? Uh, we think it's an, potential adder, but, but it is not call, it would not draw that, that total processing equipment in. We would view the alignment with Coma Chair, to inaudible, to, to Haul as really being the, the, the thesis and the alignment on the biopharma, biopharma processing piece. And then, you know, to around this out, they've got Genevac and Life Sciences equipment and, and FTS, and, and, and there's a lot to like around those, those areas of, of what we can have from a, from an ATS, Coma Chair, SP integration to, to offer that full process solution, whether it's biopharma or pharma processing. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much, that's it for me. Operator. Great. Um, well, we will conclude, and, and, you know, if I step back, we're pleased with the performances quarter and recognize the hard work and dedication of our teams across ATS that made this possible. Thank you for joining us. I look forward to speaking to you on our Q4 call in May. Stay safe and goodbye for now.",
      "withCtc" : "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ATS Automation Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast.

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Stuart. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another strong quarter for ATS, featuring order bookings, order backlog, and revenue records, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion. Although the pandemic and supply chain disruptions created a challenging and fluid business environment. Organic revenue growth was robust. Newly acquired businesses performed a plan, and we completed two acquisitions. SP Industries expands our capabilities and offerings throughout the life cycle of pharmaceutical development. DF enhances our offerings and aseptic fill finish. Today, I will update you on our business and then Ryan will provide his financial report. Starting with our value drivers, Q three revenues were five hundred and forty seven million dollars up forty eight percent from two three last year driven by a combination of acquired businesses and strength across our core operations. Organically, revenues grew twenty two percent year over year, a positive result that was augmented by the pandemic impact on Q three revenues in the prior year. Q three order bookings were a record six hundred and seventy-one million dollars, up fifty-four percent year over year. CFT, Biodot, and SP contributed approximately two thirds of order bookings growth versus last year. Bookings were strong across most market verticals, with large customer awards and consumer products and transportation. Our adjusted EVIT margin for the quarter was twelve point nine percent, representing margin expansion of over a hundred basis points from Q three of last year. Moving to our outlook. Our backlog grew to a record one point five billion dollars at the end of the quarter, providing us with a solid base of business and good revenue visibility. The pandemic situation remains fluid, and we continue to work with our customers and employees to manage the challenges, including newly imposed travel restrictions in certain jurisdictions and supply chain interruptions. Despite the challenges, our teams have done an excellent job to ensure customer needs are met. By market, conditions remain positive in life sciences, with good activity in our key sectors of medical devices, pharma, and radio pharma. Today, our funnel is comprised of more traditional, non-COVID-related opportunities. In EV, we continue to see robust activity levels with rapid growth in the battery assembly market. We won several mandates during the quarter, including a large award from a repeat customer. As our customers experience new complexities from evolving battery technologies, our long track record and proven expertise in the battery assembly and test space position ATS as a trusted partner. In food and beverage, our order funnel remains strong with opportunities in food processing leading the way. In consumer, we're seeing continued activity in warehouse automation. In energy, the market for automated tools and related services for nuclear refurbishment is expanding. The decommissioning market also continues to evolve, and we see prospects in both North America and globally. There are also emerging opportunities in isotope production and small modular reactor markets, as well as grid batteries. On services, order bookings grew both year for year and sequentially. Utilization and expansion of our regional service network coupled with the use of digital support tools have improved our ability to support our customers. In turn, our customers continue to embrace our digital services platform. We see opportunities to expand our aftermarket services footprint and add to our digital capabilities. Operationally, we faced a challenging business environment resulting from global supply chain issues and the pandemic. We've experienced some supplier lead time extensions, and our team has completed several related problemv-ingsol events. These challenges are likely to persist in the near term. To summarize our outlook, this quarter included record order bookings, record order backlog, and a robust funnel. We're encouraged by recent activity levels. However, global supply chain and labor market dynamics represent a challenge and uncertainty. The situation is actively monitored and countermeasures implemented wherever possible. Moving to the ABM, our continuous improvement playbook. This was another busy quarter with continued emphasis on improving our value drivers, both operationally and commercially. Our linear motion business held the Kaisen to remove waste from a critical assembly process. The kaizen resulted in a 50% reduction in floor space, lower inventory requirements, and a 20% improvement in cycle time. A life sciences division held a Kaizen on their spur parts order processing. Through collaborative efforts, they were able to improve efficiency by 50%. Our services business held a joint kaizen with a customer to define requirements for a turnkey training, execution, and spare parts management program. These joint efforts are a great way to provide value to our customers while also strengthening our relationships. We continue to employ our global virtual ABM boot camps on the back of similar successful events and proceeding. quarters The camp runs over a six week period and combines self paced learning and real time discussions with ABM leaders. This modified virtual format enables us to continue scaling our training and demonstrates how businesses across ATS use the ABM to drive tangible results. On MA, acquisitions and strategic core markets continue to be an important complement to ATS's organic growth. During the quarter, we closed two acquisitions, SP being the largest in ATS history. SP is a designer and manufacturer of high-grade biopharma processing equipment, life sciences equipment, and lab apparatus products. SP expands our life sciences capabilities and offerings through the addition of its aseptic and non-aseptic Lyle portfolio. Notably, the combination of ATS and SP will allow us to better support the needs of our customers throughout the life cycle of pharmaceutical development and production. After deploying capital to these latest acquisitions, our balance sheet remains strong. We will continue to cultivate and evaluate acquisition opportunities consistent with our proven strategy. Of course, timing of acquisitions will be variable, and our approach to deploying our balance sheet will be disciplined and strategic, as will the integrations that follow. Of note, we continue to make progress in the integration of previous acquisitions, including CFT, which was acquired last March, Biodot, acquired in June, and NCC, which joined in September. At Biodot, administrative tasks associated with the integration are largely complete, and our efforts are focused on continuing to deploy the ABM playbook. At CFT, we continue to roll out the ATS business model, focused on opportunities to further synergies in our supply chains and cost structures, and completed several ABM activities. These included standard work events, a raw material problem solving event and a communication kaizen which drove increased awareness and engagement across the business. At ATS, our innovation activities are ongoing as they form part of our expand strategy. In the past quarter, we have completed a number of projects and initiatives that have resulted in the launch of a new highed-spe debug camera, GMP testing and certification of our SuperTrack Pharma product, and the development of a new energy management software program that will enable customers to track and reduce their carbon footprint. We're pleased that our acquired company are also innovators. At the recent Chicago Process Expo, our NCC business won the Innovation Award for the Sanitary Design of the NCC Side Drive Conveyance System. We have filed the patent for this system, which has multiple applications, including raw and packaged food products. Congratulations to the whole NCC team. Well done. In summary, the results of the quarter and year-to-ated demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our business and portfolio offerings. Record order booking activity reflects the alignment we have with our customers in providing best-ins-clas solutions. Going forward, we are unwavering in our commitment to protecting and engaging our employees, serving our customers well, and creating value for our shareholders. We will execute on these priorities through the application of the ABM playbook with the goal of driving continuous improvement in our performance. Our record order backlog provides good revenue visibility, while the healthy balance sheet enables pursuit of organic growth and strategic MA opportunities. Our objective is to build a great ATS business. And we're making progress every day towards our collective goal. Now I will turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan, over to you. Thank you, Andrew. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning I will provide an overview of our Q3 operating results that featured growth and revenues, both year over year and sequentially, adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and record order bookings and backlog. I will then review our balance sheet, which we have deployed strategically to expand our customer capabilities and earnings potential. Starting with operating results. Bookings were six hundred and seventy one million, up 54% compared to Q3 last year. Organic growth in bookings was 18%, partially offset by a 5% headwind from foreign exchange translation. Organic growth came from transportation as a result of new and follow-on work in EV, energy markets due to follow-on work, and consumer products due to a large customer program won during the quarter. Acquisitions contributed forty one percent growth in order bookings, with the majority coming in food and beverage due to several new programs booked by our CFT businesses. On a trailing twelve month basis, our book to bill ratio was one point one five to one, positioning us well for continued organic revenue growth. Moving to revenues, our Q three top line increased forty-eight percent over Q three last year. Organic growth was 22% due to higher order backlog entering the quarter, as well as year-over-year growth in service and parts revenues. Foreign exchange was a 5% headwind compared to Q3 last year. Acquired companies added 31% to revenue growth, with CFT and SP the primary contributors. Due to seasonality, and as expected, CFT revenues were lower in comparison to Q2. Going forward, CFT is well positioned with a healthy order backlog following a very strong order bookings result in Q three. Our Q three ending backlog of one point five billion dollars was fifty percent higher than Q three last year. Looking forward, our revenue conversion for Q four is estimated to be in the thirty five to forty percent range of order backlog. As a reminder, this estimate is based on revenue expectations for both the execution of projects from backlog and work that will be booked and billed within the quarter. Moving to margins, Q three gross margin included $5.1 million of costs related to the fair value adjustment of inventories acquired through acquisition activity. Excluding this adjustment, Q3's adjusted gross margin was 29.8%, 200 basis points higher than the cost of the cost of the comparable period a year ago. Higher gross margin reflected operating efficiencies from strong project execution, improvements in the cost structure of our core business through previous reorganizations, increased service revenues, and other continuous improvement efforts achieved by deploying our ABF. Disruptions in supply chain have led to increased lead times and in some cases increases in cost in our supply base. To date, this has not had a material impact on our profitability. Our teams have implemented countermeasures, including advancing order timing and securing alternative sources of supply to mitigate inflationary pressures and lengthening lead times. Even with these countermeasures, supply chain pressures remain dynamic and will continue to present a challenge to our mitigation efforts going forward. Moving to SGNA, expenses were $43.6 million higher than Q3 last year. This year's costs included $16.7 million of acquisition related amortization and $6.3 million of doll acarsquisition related transaction costs. Excluding these items in both periods, Q three's SGNA was seventy nine point nine million dollars, twenty five point nine million higher than last year, reflecting incremental SGNA costs from acquired companies, primarily CFT, Biodot, and SP. Third quarter stock compensation expense was twelve point seven million dollars, up from four point nine million dollars last year. Q three adjusted earnings from operations were seventy point four million or twelve point nine percent compared to forty three point eight million or eleven point eight percent last year. The increase in margin reflected efficiency gains made in our cost structure through effectively implemented reorganizations, improved program execution, and increased after-sale service revenues compared to a year ago. Excluding acquisitions, our core business operated with a 14.3% adjusted earnings from operations margin, up 250 basis points over Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings margins from our acquired businesses were 7.4%. As expected, we saw a sequential reduction in earnings at Biodot as business volumes normalized following a period of higher demand for COVID-related products. As expected, CFT operated at a low single-digit even margin in the third quarter. Actions to improve the cost structure of the business and drive savings through supply chain synergies are underway and on track. In the quarter, supply chain savings were partially offset by increased costs of materials such as stainless steel. We are confident that the ongoing deployment of the ABM at CFT, including core tools such as daily visual management, problem solving, and Kaisen events will drive improvements in the business. As previously announced, we also took action to reorganize certain CFT subsidiaries, including closing two facilities and consolidating product lines. These actions will drive cost efficiencies in line with our plan and bring focus to areas with a stronger value proposition. Restructurs of $4.2 million were incurred in the third quarter. Integration of SP and DF are in the early stages. Our teams are working to achieve identified synergies between our pharma businesses, including ATS Life Sciences, Comach,h andare now with the addition the V S P and D F. Q three adjusted EPS was fifty two cents per share compared to thirty cents per share last year. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in revenues and improved operating margins. Moving to the balance sheet, in Q3 we generated cash from operations of $82.1 million up from $78.9 million last year on growth in revenues and operating margins. Our non-cash working capital as a percentage of revenue remained low at 6.3% in Q3, up slightly from 6% in Q2, and well within our target of maintaining working capital as a percentage of revenues below 15%. We invested $11.3 million in CapEx and intangible assets in Q3, compared to $7 million in Q3 last year. Higher investments, primarily related to the expansion and improvement of facilities and investments in IT. On leverage, our December net debt to adjust the EBITDA ratio was 3.1 to 1 as we drew on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of SP in Q3. As we have said previously, we are willing to temporarily increase our leverage for the right opportunities. On a pro-forma basis, including the trailing 12-month EBITDAC contributions of acquired businesses, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately two point six to one. We ended the quarter with two hundred million dollars of cash and availability on our credit facilities of approximately one hundred and seventy one million. Going forward, we're focused on maintaining our strong balance sheet and flexibility in our financing to continue supporting our growth strategies. In summary, strong growth continued in Q three, including record quarterly revenues, bookings, and backlog, and we pursued margin expansion with good results. These accomplishments reflected organic growth, on-planned contributions from our newly acquired businesses, and the ongoing application of our ABM playbook. Our global teams have demonstrated strong performance in challenging business conditions as we continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Now we will open the call to questions from our analysts. Operator, could you please provide instructions? Thank you. Thank you. You ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question and answer session. To allow as many voices to be heard as possible, please limit yourself to two questions per turn. If you have a question, please press the star followed by the one on your touchstone phone. Your questions will be bold in the ord in the order they're received. Please ensure you leave the handset if you're using a speakerphone before pressing any keys. One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from Cherlene Radbourne with GD Securities. Please go ahead. Um Andrew, as we think about your MA agenda after a very busy twelve months, can you give us a sense of how much white space is left in life sciences for you and where your areas of focus will be going forward. Yeah, good good good morning, Sherilyn. Um so I'm gonna walk through first, really pleased with the progress we've made here. And as we continue to build out our focus on key markets, key areas, we've also increased what we view as as the potential. And so our funnel was healthy and remains healthy in this space. And there are multiple areas we like, as you're well aware. One is in life sciences, and even with the addition of SP, not only do we view biopharma as having additional opportunity, when we look at their life sciences equipment space, it opens up new niche markets that we view have potential for ATS in the future. A couple items to to to highlight, our balance sheet remains strong, but secondly, the cultivation activity that we do today oftentimes will pay off two years from now. So when we look at our strategic layout and our strategic structure, we're constantly focused on how to ensure that we build those relationships. We put us in a position that when an available target becomes available, ATS can win. And as you're well aware, we look at niche applications that are leaders in their spaces, leaders in technology that we can bring together and really provide solutions for our customers. Great. That's great color. Um and then for Ryan, um, your backlog conversion has been above guidance for the last several quarters and I was hoping you could help us understand that. Is that because there are now certain short cycle revenues that aren't factored into the backlog conversion or is the company just continuing to exceed its own expectations for backlog conversion. Um yeah, good morning Sherilyn. So uh so I I'll start. Th this is something that we do look at every quarter and and we base the estimate um on what is in our backlog or expectations and and uh specifically to your question we have added uh faster turning businesses so S P i as a as an example is a quicker turning business. Their projects are generally shorter cycle than than the core ATS business. They also have the labware and glassware business, which is uh a faster turning business. Um in this quarter we were a bit higher than uh that thirty five to forty percent range. Uh just over half of that, about just over one percent was related to SP, which was not part of our business when we provided that range last quarter. So i in the short term, we are dealing with supply chain headwinds. Uh there there's been an uptick in employee absenteeism related to COVID. And so that's led us to keep that rate in that 35 to 40% range. Over time, again to the to your question, given the addition of more products, technologies, uh growth in services, we may see this rate increase, but i in today's environment, uh our our outlook is is in that thirty five to forty percent range. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. That's all from me. Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Neville with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning guys. Excuse me. Um yeah, another great quarter. Um I guess just I on these supply chain presses, um, again you're calling this out longer lead times, labor, etcetera. Uh I guess I'm just curious, sort of incrementally have things gotten materially worse, um uh or or or not? Um 'cause again we're not really seeing it in the numbers and just trying to sort of gauge what it means for the next quarter or two. Yeah, good good good morning, Mark. Um I'll start then Ryan, feel free to jump in if there's areas you want to add. Um so to to start, we have and and you know I'll just walk through this quickly. We we've really launched our view of the ABM around this and and and it's something we call daily visual management. Effectively what you're doing is you're looking at every business, every site, every area on a daily basis and and you know red or green, do you have an issue or not? And if you have an issue, how do you then resolve that issue and and drive? And so we know from from not only from a regional, from a site specific area at my level across the enterprise. I can pull it weekly, I can pull it you know, daily if needed. What's going on in our supply chain and and what do we really need to drive to assess? And so quite candidly it has gotten worse. And and quite candidly, you know, it is a it is a challenge today, one that we're planning for for for the remainder of the calendar year. Now there's different opinions on when that will call it come back to normal, but our view has been tactically how do we drive impact here? How do we minimize the impact? Additionally, how do we set ourselves up for success in the long term? And so with candidly i i it has increased. Our team continues to perform. It is an area that we are very focused on and we're identifying short term and midterm countermeasures on a daily basis to ensure that we stay ahead of any challenges, uh whether it's supply chain or or general inflation. And I I guess just to follow up sort of on Sherlin's question just around backlog conversion, again, like this your your your guides would sort of capture these supply chain issues um and again sort of anything that you might book and burn in the quarter. Because again it does feel like structurally the business has become sort of a pyre for conversion businesses with recent M and A. Y yeah, so so uh uh i i again, it it'ss th that' a fair comment. Um a and you know, I I I I won't r rehash the the the whole discussion, but um y uh uh as I said, uh as as we add more products tech,nology services, um and S P i is a shorter shorter cycle business and it has more products, I do expect that the rate will continue to increase. But yeah, i in today's environment it's you know, as Andrew just said, it's very dynamic. Um there's there's headwinds in supply chain. Uh there's headwinds still related to to COVID and the re resurgence there. So you know, w we're we're being prudent in in this and and you know I I I think I think that's appropriate. Okay. Um if we're gonna ask a second question, just on M and A. I guess two part question. Um I think sequentially the contribution was down quarter over quarter and I'm guessing that's wild dot and then second question on M and A. Um I mean you've got that base shelf perspective so there maybe just show comments on sort of your thoughts around having that available. Thanks guys. Yeah, so um uh on Biodot, yes, correct. It is it was down in revenues and that that was expected as I said my prepared comments. Um that business had a uh had quite a strong covet tailwind uh related to to a couple of products that that they they offer and we did expect that to normalize. It did happen in the quarter and and the business is is really uh I'd say in line with expectations, but the reality is it's it's still ahead of our expectations in terms of its performance. So so we're very pleased there. Um y your second question I think was on the base shelf filing. So um w we really look at this uh as as a tool and and what what has helped us be successful um in in MA over the past couple of years is is having flexibility and the ability to get a deal done, in in particular without financing conditions. And from a seller's perspective, that takes a lot of of risk out the process. And and so you know as as we're looking forward, we've talked about our growth strategy, MA is a big part of that. We want to have uh continue to have financial flexibility and having this base shelf in place is is an important part of that that uh that flexibility going forward. Got it. Thanks Megas. Thank you. Your next question comes from David Ocampo with CoreMax Securities. Please go ahead. Uh good morning everyone. R Ryan, last quarter y you you provided a uh Since there's a lot of moving parts in in the quarter as it relates to you know acquisitions as well as supply chain issues. I was just wondering where your your base operating margins are right now. Yeah, so so I I I I I did mention this in my prepared remarks, but we we are in the mid fourteen percent range, so uh fourteen point three percent. We we were actually down slightly. We were fourteen four in the prior sequential quarter. Um a and the the the headwind there was was related to stock comp. It was about a thirty to forty basis point uh impact on our core margins, um our gross margin and uh in in in in operating margins were both ahead excluding Stock Comp. Um and then the acquisitions uh were in the the high single-digit range, seven and a half percent. And I talked through the different components there, but just to r to reiterate, so CFT has uh historically been at a low single-digit even margin and they continue to be in line there. So you know we've made progress, some of the some of the day one costs that we expected have come out. We've had some early wins in supply chain. Now again, there's there's other areas in supply chain, for example, commodities, and I mentioned stainless steel. They're a large consumer of that, and that's an area where we do have more of a challenge to offset those cost increases. So they're performing to plan. The restructuring we announced will further help with their cost and oper andating efficiencies. Um the other big piece of of our acquisition margins was Biodot. And I talked about um you know that's been a a very strong performer for us, really driven by the some of those COVID tailwinds and we did see that as I said normalize in the quarter. And so their margins are still accretive to to our overall margins, but they did come down relative to Q2. Yeah. now between internal equipment versus third party equipment that you guys are using for I guess the in the entirety of your sales? Uh so it it it it hasn't really changed. It's still in that it's still in that forty percent range. W which is typically where it's been. It it it it ranges a little bit, forty to forty five, but it's it's still in that forty percent range. That's forty percent internal, right? Uh yes, correct. And and do you guys have a a target on where that's David, sorry, I I misunderstood your question. That's forty percent is third party uh equipment. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen as a reminder should you have any questions please press star one. Your next question comes from Justin Keywood with SEFL G MP. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Uh thanks for taking my call and nice to see the continued strength in the business. On the organic growth, uh it was uh strong again at twenty one point five percent. I'm wondering if we just take a step back and uh if you could describe some of the factors driving that organic growth uh across the different segments and and how you see organic growth playing out in uh the near term and uh medium term. Um you know sure. Good morning Justin. No uh so I'll I'll characterize this at the top level but I'll go into specifics. So if we look at the markets, we generally state the markets are are are favorable and and good. And then if we look at our funnel as I mentioned, our funnel remains solid. I then I then you know would would be remiss to to not add in the operating environment, which we would say is challenging and and we would say not only, you know, from a from a supply chain but also when you look at the pandemic impact. So so it is a challenging environment, but our teams continue to perform and continue to drive. Then if I step into each segment and and I did talk a bit about this in the prepared remarks, but to add a little additional color, you know life sciences, uh when we look at this this area, it's largely compiled comprised of of non covet opportunities now. And and you know, things do get a little bit blurry in that, you know, vaccine rollout and as we get more biopharma, more more pharma, it really does impact whether it's that or new drugs or new discoveries. But but that market, you know, call it year to date growth is roughly fifteen percent. This quarter was a little more impacted by some delays in in in elective surgeries. And so we did see some impact this quarter, but as we look at our year to date number, we still see this as a solid market and and one that provides opportunities for the future. The funnel remains healthy here. In EV, look, we're seeing activity uh continue to pick up and and we booked a large award within the quarter and we continue to work with uh with a new customer in Europe. Uh and and and you know as you look at the stricter emissions and you look at the the the the focus on driving this in in that sector in that space, we do view that we are positioned well to help our customers through that and we do view this as an area that we can continue to support and drive growth within our solution set, within our technology, within within our clock value within the within the market. Consumer, we saw good activity in warehouse automation and and we are seeing uh s some some pickup in in in the cosmetic space. As a matter of fact, uh I recently visited a customer in this area and it was fascinating because this customer specifically walked through their model, their business with me where so they're they're impacted by by by a reduced sunscreen because of the limited travel, but yet their home care products have have have skyrocketed and and skyrocketed to them was a big number but, but I don't reference what that number is. And so we have seen that market start to come back and we have seen, you know, the funnel really align with that. And and then, you know, to round this out, uh our food business. Um you know when we think about primary processing, you know, and think think uh tomato to to initial processing, so so from vine to puree was a solid quarter. And you know w we are seeing a bit of an uptick there and and and and a favorable setup for the the the harvest season that's coming up. Energy, uh you know I I I mentioned this in in in in the announcement in in the update, you know, this this continues to be a strong market for us, continues to be an area that we view we can offer high value for our customer base. We're continuing to look at at opportunities to expand a niche application to ensure that it's high value in the markets we serve. And lastly, boy, you know, our our services team continues to execute and and if you look at, you know, versus prior quarter and and year over year, the the growth that they've seen. And you know, it's this is an interesting one and and one to highlight where even in my tenure here, this has gone from a nice to have to a str strategic imperative for our customers where when they when they came to us in the beginning it was, Well, do you have services and ca what can you offer and going through. Now it's because of the pandemic, because of the supply chain disruptions, because of you know machine dependency and or turnover, they're looking at our services organization as a key enabler. And so when companies and and and customers in say the UK went down and went on lockdown, ATS could still execute, ATS could still provide that value because we launched digital tools, because we had the regional service network. And so I truly think this has been an enabler for us to keep driving share and and driving that value for our customers. And so overall I would say to get back to my initial point, generally favorable in the markets, positive, and and our funnel remains healthy and aligned around it. Uh but the operating environment is challenging. Thank you. Very helpful context and uh good to hear the new EV customer win in uh Europe. Just on the services growth that you mentioned, uh what was that in the quarter? And just to provide some context, if we look at aftermarket services as a percentage of sales, what was that prior to the pandemic or a couple of years ago? What is it today and what would be the long term target for that area? So uh in terms of uh after sales services as a percentage of revenues. Uh it's it's mid to high teens today, so it's been in the a and it's while it's grown, the the rest of our business has grown too. So uh it it's it's had to keep up which which it has. Um you know, a few years ago i and I don't have the data i in front of me, but if we went back four or five years it would have been in the low teens, maybe ten, twelve percent. So it it's it's it' itss growth has outpaced um the the equipment side of the business, which which we view as a as as very positive and in much for the reasons that Andrew just outlined. And uh one other item that that I would just uh want to highlight as well is is the growth in our digital solutions around whether it's Illuminate or or what what PA's doing in in their business to really provide not only data collection, but then utilizing the data to then bring back in a solution set that helps customers improve their process. And so we have seen that be a real call it bright spot in growth, but it's still relatively small across the you know the total business, but we do view that as an area of growth for our organization and one we can help our customers as they navigate this this time. That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you. Your next question comes from Maxime Chichiv with National Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Max. Morning. Um Andrew, maybe just the the first question for you. Um in terms of you know how we think about uh uh M and A and and the timing of it, how do you balance uh that dynamic with uh obviously the need to properly integrate um especially SP which was a pretty sizable transaction. So d do you mind maybe just walking us through your thought process there? Uh yeah, and and and and Max, there's there's no perfect answer here. What I can walk you through is we've developed an integration playbook. It's it's very standard around how we operate and how we s walk into businesses and and you know, as you are well aware, when we look at an acquisition, we have four criteria and you know, it's markets, it's it's strategic rationale. One of them is is is the management assessment and and their ability to align around the ABM. And so we do assess that going in and then ultimately in the early days of the integration you start to align around where they are in their journey and and and where do we need to press, where do we need to, you know, help in that solution set. So we have a very good indication when we acquire a business of where they are in that journey and and and where we can help. And so what I can tell you is we have built out our capability and our ability within our leadership team to be able to align and and continue to build out their portfolio of solutions. We are selective in in in what we are going to add and we look at it from a value creation perspective, both from a shareholder and a customer perspective, from what we can offer whether it's technology or solutions. And as you're well aware, the cultivation activity, while you know I I will say it often, oftentimes will will will play out two, three, four years from now. And so uh we are not slowing down this activity. We do view that there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to add here, but we're gonna be extremely disciplined. And so to answer your question head on, we have built our capability among our team. We certainly are are taking and ensuring that we have a key focus on SP to execute, to ensure that they meet and exceed our expectations. And then lastly, we're not slowing down our cultivation and and we're going to continue in the areas that we view are going to add value over over the long term for ATS. Okay, that makes a lot of s sense. Thank you for that. And then just one quick follow up on on S P. Um in terms of the ability to cross sell their consumer bills business, do you mind maybe just providing some data points there? Because my understanding is that uh I think most of the sales process there is going through distributors. And I'm just curious to see how you think about sort of leveraging that potential business into the rest of the ATS i if it's possible. So so Max, uh you know, I I I think just to confirm, you're asking about the labware glassware business. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so so so we we we certainly uh you know we did a lot of diligence to understand this space and and the stickiness with with their you know, call it Bell Art portfolio as well as the the other areas uh within that within that space and you know w we view this as as a as a as a business that you know while it's low single digits it's it's a it's a market that has consistent continued revenue and and when we think about the consistency there it's one one we like from a standpoint of of their, we don't want to call it consumable, but their recurring revenue and and their approach around the the brand being a strong brand and the markets they serve. And so it does go through distribution. Uh it's an area that that we certainly see you know value in continuing to to help them execute their plan. Uh does it help sell biopharma processing equipment? Uh we think it's an potential adder, but but it is not call it would not draw that that total processing equipment in. We would view the alignment with Comacher to IDOC Techno to to Hull as really being the the thesis and the alignment on the biopharmacy biopharma processing piece. And then, you know, to round this out, they've got Genovac and life sciences equipment and and FTS and and and there's a lot to like around those those areas of of what we can have from a from an ATS, coma chair, SP integration to to offer that full process solution, whether it's biopharma or or pharma processing. Okay. Okay. Great. Um well we will conclude and and you know if I step back, we're pleased with the performance this quarter and recognize the hard work and dedication of our teams across ATS that made this possible. Thank you for joining us. I look forward to speaking to you on our Q4 call in May. Stay safe and goodbye for now."

      "baseline" : "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to CGI's first quarter fiscal twenty twenty two conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Kevin Lender, Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasury, and Head of investor relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Linder.

We're also hosting our annual general meeting this morning, so we hope you'll join us live via the broadcast at eleven AM. I'll now turn it over to Francois to review our Q1 financials and then George will comment on our business and market outlook. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to share with you the results of our first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty two. Our revenue growth continues to accelerate on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong bookings from prior quarters, along with continued demand for our digital services and business solutions. In addition, we delivered double digit EPS growth despite a strong Canadian dollar causing handwinds in our reporting currency. We recorded revenue of three point one billion dollars up six point eight percent year over year on a constant currency basis. Strong constant currency growth was seen in the following segments Asia Pacific up nineteen point five percent, Western and Southern Europe up fifteen point two percent. US commercial and state government up fourteen point five percent, Central and Eastern Europe up eleven point nine percent, and Canada up eight point three percent. Total bookings were three point six billion dollars, representing a book to bill of one hundred and sixteen point five percent for the quarter and lifting our trailing twelve months book to bill to one hundred and fifteen point two percent compared to one hundred and three percent for the prior year. I would like to call out a few segments with strong bookings in the quarter. Scandinavia at one hundred and seventeen percent. U TheK and Australia at one hundred and twenty two percent. And Finland, Poland and Baltics with a book to bill of three hundred and fifty three percent, driven by a new eight year managed services contract signed with the Finnish government, whereby CGI will serve as the largest provider of hybrid IT services to dozens of public sector organizations. In addition, yesterday we announced an award by the U.S. Department of Justice for a two hundred and fifty million US dollar blanket purchase agreement with the first task order already granted for a value of one hundred and thirty four million US dollars or approximately one hundred and seventy million in Canadian dollars. Out of our eight proximity geographic segments, six now have a trailing twelve months book to bill well above a hundred percent. New business was thirty-three percent of bookings, an increase from the previous year's twenty-eight percent. On a trelling twelve month basis, new business was also thirty-three percent as compared to twenty-six percent for their year-ago period. Our global backlog increased to by eight hundred and eight million dollars year over year and remained strong at twenty three point six billion dollars. This backlog represents one point nine times revenue, the vast majority of which is comprised of long term managed services and digital transformation engagement. Given the continued increase demand for our services, as reflected by the strong bookings in the last few quarters, we expect continuing positive momentum. On the profitability front, adjusted EBIT in T one was five hundred and twenty one point five million dollars while EBIT margins increased to sixteen point nine percent, up fifty basis points compared to Q one last year. The year over year increase was mainly due to revenue growth in IT services and solutions and improved utilization primarily within the Western and Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and US federal segments. In addition, we continue to benefit from stronger margins due to operational excellence. We delivered strong EBIT margins in the following segments Asia Pacific at thirty two point one percent, Canada at twenty five point six percent, UK and Australia at fifteen point eight percent and Western and southern Europe at fifteen point four percent. Due to the strength of our value proposition to clients and our embedded indexation clauses with our c i w within our contracts, we have largely been able to absorb wage and other cost pressures in our pricing. Our effective tax rate in Q one was twenty five point five percent compared to twenty five point nine percent in the prior year. We continue to expect our tax rate for future quarters to be in the range of twenty four point five to twenty six point five percent. And earnings were three hundred sixty seven million dollars in And diluted earnings per share were one dollar and forty nine cents, representing an increase of twelve point nine percent year over year. This improvement was mainly due to revenue growth and e-bet margins improvements as outlined earlier. Excluding integration costs and earnings were three hundred and sixty nine million dollars for a margin of eleven point nine percent, and diluted earnings per share were one dollar and fifty cents, an accretion of twelve point eight percent when compared to one dollar and thirty three cents in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, cash provided by operating activities were was four hundred e andighty four million dollars compared to five hundred and ninety seven million dollars in the prior year, which had reduced variable compensation payments related to the impact of the pandemic. As a percentage of revenue, our cash generation was strong at 15.7%. The DSO was 45 days compared to 44 days last year aligned with our targets. For the last 12 months, cash provided by operating activities was two billion dollars or sixteen point four percent of revenue. This represents eight dollars and two cents in cash per share. In the quarter, we invested two hundred and six million dollars in our build and buy profitable growth strategy, mainly in our IP and for the acquisition of CONI Case Management Consulting and RA. In addition, we use two hundred sixty seven million dollars to buy back our stock. Buying back CGI stock has been an accretive and flexible way to return capital to shareholders. As such, yesterday, our board of directors approved the extension of the NCIB program until February 2023, allowing us to purchase up to 18.8 million shares over the next 12 months. In addition, we reimburse two hundred and fifty million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter, leaving only fifty million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of fiscal twenty twenty two. With the issuance of our senior notes in September twenty twenty one, CGI's weighted average maturity is now four point nine years with a hundred percent fixed interest uh fixed interest rate at very favorable rates. Consistent with previous years, we review our capital allocation plan to formulate the most effective capital deployment strategy to maximize shareholder returns. In Qan, we delivered a return on invested capital of fifteen point three percent, a significant increase when compared to fifth twelve point four percent in the year ago period, returning to pre pandemic levels. Looking ahead, as and as indicated during our investor day this past November, our cash allocation priority remains the same. Investing in our business, pursuing accreditative acquisition and buying back our stock. With a net debt to capitalization ratio of twenty seven point eight percent at the end of December, as well as two point seven billion dollars of cash readily available and access to more if needed, CGI has the strength and capital resources to support our build and buy profitable growth strategy. Now I will turn the call to George to further discuss the insights and the first time. Thank you, Francois, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased with our team's strong first quarter financial performance. We started fiscal year 2022 with positive momentum in all key metrics, double-digit EPS accretion, accelerated revenue growth on a year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, robust bookings for the quarter and the last twelve months, and cash from operations of fifteen point seven percent for the quarter. The continued strength of our financial performance is grounded in our consultants' ability to earn clients' trust every day. This is evident in our modernization and digitization wins in the quarter. For example, Fannie Mae extended our long term partnership in the U.S. We're awarded new work to support their migration to the Pioneer in health and care and social services in Finland has expanded their relationship with CGI to assist in completing their Google cloud based transformation. This engagement aims to help optimize costs and increase business agility. The Quebec government selected CGI to help them establish and operate a new government cloud for the next three years. Upon completion, this cloud environment will be delivering services to multiple government agencies serving over eight million citizens. Electro Scandia, the Swedish electrical wholesaler, which is a company of Stonepar, the world's largest electrical products, systems, and services firm, named CGI as their digital transformation partner to support their modernization efforts, including the implementation of SAP S4HANA. The French Agency for Ecological Transition chose CGI to deliver application services, Agile at Scale, and DevOps to help modernize their technology capabilities and services supporting over three million businesses. And in the UK, the University of Nottingham awarded CGI a new consulting services agreement. Through this partnership, we will help modernize their digital value chain and supportive learning services for over forty five thousand students and seven thousand employees. Our robust bookings in the quarter were led by awards from government sector clients up twenty eight percent year over year for book the bill of one hundred and fifty one percent. We expect this uptick to continue given that governments around the world are reprioritizing their IT initiatives in line with the evolving public health and economic environment. On a sequential quarter basis, we also saw demand accelerate in the financial services sector, resulting in a nearly 40% increase in Q1 bookings and a book to bill of 114%. This was driven by client demand for digital services across all geographic segments. In addition to our strong performance, clients continue to recognize the depth and breadth of our knowledge and expertise, resulting in all-time high client satisfaction scores. Notably, our two highest client satisfaction scores measure how we partner with clients, specifically our level of commitment, collaboration, and communication. These qualities are key elements of the world-cslas delivery excellence for which CGI is known. In fact, client executives often raise these qualities as some of the most important priorities for their partner selection and cite them as differentiators for CGI. As a People Center firm, we also recognize that our success is founded on the strength of our consultants and professionals, 85% of whom are CGI shareholders. Our employee satisfaction scores also continue to be at record high levels. This is primarily due to our ongoing investments in digital tooling, health and well being, and employee development. These are critical elements to provide rapid career growth for our talented employees and are therefore instrumental to our overall employee retention. As such, our voluntary attrition rates remain below the IT services industry average. Now as Atlanta during our recent investor and market analyst day, client demand for end to end digitization remains the key driver for CGI's planned profitable growth in fiscal twenty twenty two and beyond. During that meeting, we shared four areas of investment with annual and three year objectives. First and foremost, in industry knowledge to help clients and their quest to build their right future. And technology expertise to support them in building it right. And offering intellectual property assets to enable them to build with speed. And finally, the operational excellence to help clients operate and evolve their planned future state. Today I will provide updates on each of these areas, starting with the right industry knowledge. We announced our plan to grow strategic business and IT consulting services revenue by 15 to 20 percent on a compound annual growth rate basis over the next three years. In the quarter, we saw an uptick in consulting and systems integration demand as bookings increased by over $100 million compared to this time last year. This is due in part to the expansion of our local consulting practices and the related increased investment in hiring and developing industry expertise. In fact, we are finalizing a new white paper which consolidates input from our board of directors, CGI industry experts, and external alliance partners to explore the key trends that will impact and shape the long-term trajectories of most global industries. Our consultants will be sharing this paper with our clients to help inform their strategic planning, and we will then discuss with clients how CGI can best support their business objectives. Our next area of investment, technology expertise, helps clients balance the potential of technology with the reality of complex enterprise delivery. We previously announced our fiscal twenty twenty two plan to increase employee training in digital technologies by 33%. A key mechanism for supporting this plan is CGI's online university, where 35% of employees completed courses in Q1. This training enables rapid reskilling and upskilling in areas of high demand, such as scaled agile and cloud technologies. Also, in support of our technical expertise investment, we plan to add over fifteen thousand employee certifications of global alliance partner solutions over the next three years. So far this year, we have already surpassed twenty one hundred of these certifications. This has contributed to a 15% increase in bookings with our global alliance partners on a year-over-year basis. Leveraging our investments in intellectual property, we also announced our plan to reach thirty percent of our revenue derived from IT by twenty twenty five. In the first quarter, IT services and solutions accounted for twenty two percent of revenue up from 21% last quarter. Our investments in IP globally are focused on deploying new value add capabilities across the existing IP portfolio, as well as investing to co-create with clients on new innovations to bring even greater value to clients' digital transformation and add to CGI's IP portfolio. Most importantly, our plans for operational excellence are a critical element our clients are looking for, not only for us to be a safe pair of hands, but also for us to deliver in a cost efficient manner. The three year plan we announce includes increasing headcount by fifteen percent on a three year compound annual growth rate basis across all of our global delivery centers, particularly in India. In Q one, our current hiring pays in India is almost two and a half times more than before the pandemic. This hiring contributed to the twenty percent year-over-year growth in our Asia-Pacific operations. Given CGI's strong value proposition, our attrition rate in India stands well below the India peer group average. Our ability to deliver these results is ensuring we have the right talent in both our client proximity and global delivery operations. Over the past few months, we have continued to evolve our hiring strategies to meet increasing client demand. In Q one, the number of new hires more than doubled compared to this time last year. We ended the quarter with 82,000 employees, a year-over-year net increase of 6,000 consultants and professionals. We continue to employ an effective and efficient talent attraction and onboarding approach, with two thirds of candidates coming directly to CGI, either through referrals from current employees or through direct applications for open positions on CGI.com. In addition, to support our proactive recruiting outreach, we have increased our recruiting capacity across all operating units. Our operational leaders, the same leaders who are responsible for client delivery are involved in candidate sourcing, assessment, and decision making at every step of our hiring process. This ensures tight alignment between candidate skills and client needs and reduces overall time to fill open fillable positions. So moving to the growth outlook for the rest of the year, we expect client demand for end-to-end digitization to continue accelerating across most of the key industries we serve. In government, as I stated earlier, we see positive client-demand momentum, particularly in areas well aligned to CGI's positioning and offerings. This includes helping agencies address a range of domestic priorities, spanning social and health services, infrastructure, space-based data solutions, environment and the climate, and cybersecurity. The manufacturing supply chain disruptions continue to require reshaping and reconfiguration. This is driving demand for data driven enterprises to improve service quality and generate new revenue streams through use of digital services, including AI and advanced analytics. In retail and consumer services, the permanent shift to more digital orders is requiring prioritization of omni-channel investments, while supply chain challenges are creating pressure on customer service and loyalty. Driving demand for AI and predictive analytics to improve forecasting, inventory management, and workforce planning. And in financial services, banks are aggressively implementing their digital transformation agendas to better understand their customers and improve organizational performance. Banking client initiatives now often include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. If not hinge on faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. And a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. That um decision um is that maybe a function of just you know the the M and the opportunities that you see as you think about the capital allocation for the upcoming year. Uh thanks, uh Thanos Francois. I'll take uh this one. Uh you're right. Uh you know and and that's uh what we indicated uh at the uh investor day, you know uh, we feel that you know the acquisition and M and A activities uh uh will be a lot more active this year. Uh we're talking uh about allocating a billion uh on on this and and uh we're on uh right path uh for now. So so uh and what we're seeing is that uh we we think that we'll be able to achieve uh this objective. So uh that's why we thought that again uh to wait uh uh again for for the dividend. Uh we as as indicated that we did uh we will renew our N C I B so uh uh you know if needed we will put some some investment in the uh in the share buyback but uh we think that uh uh you know versus this versus last year, uh a lot more in the MA side. Okay. Uh thank you, I'll pass the U.S. George can you just talk a little bit? You you touched in it in the comments on the IP solutions, but maybe talk about where you've been and and the journey of sort of globalizing more of the solutions. I know about a year ago this time you started down that path. Maybe give us an update on how you see things trending. Yep. No, that's uh it's a great question because uh you're right. We uh I call it our our unified approach to uh to growing IP. And uh it really is first and foremost about having process and methodology to propagate the existing IP across the entire uh channel of uh of CGI. So uh this is everything from approved value proposition through add ons to our existing IP, broader target market across industries, geographies and functions and and having a a more efficient and uh profitable uh delivery model. So just to give you a quick update, in the quarter, uh we do have over ten percent increase in the pipeline. We have an over ten percent increase in the deal size of the bookings that we have. So that's that gets to that uh improved value uh proposition and that broader uh delivery mechanism. And then we have an over ten percent increase in the win rate. So those are some nice early proof points that say that what we're doing around that propagation is uh is working. Uh in fact we have three of our SBUs that are at the thirty percent and uh and the two fastest growing are the ones that are under ten percent. So we have uh we have opportunity and uh and of course uh propagating that IP is the way to get there. Uh we're also making increased investments in the sourcing of the new IP. So this is uh everything from ideation with our industry experts, so that's uh that's showing some uh some signs of uh of opportunity, co-creating with clients. Sometimes we actually co-create and acquire the IP from our clients. Sometimes we actually just co-create and jointly own it and everything in between. That's where a lot of our best IPs actually came from. And so we uh we're doing that across uh the global CGI now. And then as I mentioned in the uh opening remarks, uh MA uh is is an area where we're gonna be looking at um uh IT services and solutions firms. Uh not just software only, but services and solutions firms. Uh we're opening up the uh the aperture to more of that in our MA. So uh you know early returns are are coming and uh and we're we're bullish on the future. Great. And then just the one final one for me, just around maybe more quarterly matters here, either you or Francois, could you talk about you mentioned client contract adjustments mainly in the UK and Australia, you mentioned a little bit in Scandinavia, but just you know, obviously this is always sort of a puts and takes, but where we are in the process of sort of running off um maybe those adjustments for those engagements and ramping other stuff. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, uh thanks. I'll I'll take it uh Paul. So so for for UK clearly it was uh you know uh one uh non recurring adjustment that uh had an impact on on their uh on their growth and contributions. So so that's behind us and and so you can expect uh to to to have a margin and and uh revenue picking up uh in the next uh few quarters in uh for UK. And and same thing for for uh in in the uh Scandinavia we we we have some some uh you know operational issue that we need to resolve in in Scandinavia, but we had also non recurring uh one time adjustment that uh uh are uh behind us and uh expecting that uh also there we'll see some some growth in the contribution. Perfect. Thank you. Financial, please go ahead. Hello, can you now Richard? Uh just uh wanted to get a bit of perspective in terms of the the operating level ofs the of the business, you know, compared to pre pandemic. Like are your utilization rates um kind of back to where they've been? Like try trying to get a bit of understanding on that. Yeah. Um actually uh our utilization rates are a little bit stronger than they were uh pre pandemic uh and and part of that is that uh that strong demand uh side that we see but also the opportunity we took uh right at the beginning of the uh pandemic to take the actions that we felt necessary. So uh we we measure the utilization on a weekly basis, uh obviously not just with reports, but in a call that I have with all the operating leaders. So uh we're very focused on it and I'm I'm pleased to to tell you that it's uh it's actually a little bit above where we were pre pandemic. Okay. And then um obviously you're in pretty constant contact with your accounts and clients. What are they saying about IT budgets um going into twenty twenty two? You know, particularly you know, how much higher they are or lower they are and kind of areas of priorities where they want to spend a Yeah, it's uh it's a good question. Obviously uh everybody's got s uh slightly different uh planning periods but uh in general uh in in areas like financial services, we see uh those budgets continuing to to go up and and across the board the focus is on both uh growing their revenue but uh and using technology to help do that and uh and and some client facing uh solutions in in their uh in their IT budgets but also focused on that operational efficiency. Uh we hear our clients uh talking about they have uh they're dealing with uh the current uh uh economic uh uh pricing pressures and and looking to make sure that they stay competitive through operational efficiencies. Technology, as you know, plays on both sides. It plays on the uh on the upside, on the revenue side, but technology also plays on the uh operational efficiency. So we we see a pretty strong environment for uh for IT and uh I've been talking for a while, Richard, this uh you know, this wasn't just pent up demand that we saw uh coming out of the the pandemic. It's it's it's something we think is sustainable from an IT perspective. Okay, and just one last quick one for me. Uh you know, on the acquisition side, uh you talked about opening up the aperture for technology. Historically, uh you guys have been more sort of value conscious and so when you look at you know technology type deals, no doubt the uh the valuations are certainly a bit more robust, uh, despite maybe the pullback here at the beginning of the year. So how how do you look at sort of the relative valuation you're kind of willing to pay for these and maybe give us a bit of perspective on on that? Yeah may maybe I'll I'll start and then I'll ask uh Francois to uh to continue. Just uh to remind you, uh we are looking to make these acquisitions accretive and so uh we're we're very conscious of not uh overpaying. Having said that, if the value is there, we're willing to pay higher multiples. So I don't know Francois And you know, where we're to a certain point conservative in our acquisition where we know we we're when're building our return we're building it uh a lot of times with with cost synergies. So for sure in IP we need to to be convinced that we will have revenue synergies and and so meaning uh expecting uh reven uh a lot more revenue increase coming from from these uh acquisitions. And and we have now the channel across the world to do it so for sure what we're looking at is IP that uh can be sold across the world, uh without no too much uh changes and and so for sure, you know, it will be valued a bit more, but uh we naturally with the return that we think we can enable we don't have any problem to to pay uh to pay the the right price. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from Paul Trevor from RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on uh you know CGI's growth relative to to the market in in peers and now maybe this isn't an apples to apples comparison, um but some of your peers have reported quite strong growths recently. I just wanted your thoughts on, you know, what's your view on CGI's growth, you know, just relative to those peers in in the market. And do you feel like you know you're matching, you're exceeding, um, or or lagging that the the growth of peers in the market Yeah, thanks for the question, uh Paul. Uh look, we we like where we are in our profitable revenue growth uh current landscape but also where we're where we're headed towards. Uh very, very proud of the fact that uh we've been able to take this uh growth that we are achieving both uh through the build and the buy and uh and drop that to earnings uh per share accretion double digits here in the first quarter. So we we like where we are on uh where we're getting that growth and uh and what the outlook is and you see that outlook based on the uh the strong book the bill again this quarter and for the trailing twelve months. So we we feel like we're in a very good um uh position to continue to uh accelerate our growth through both the build and the buy and uh and like I said our clients are rewarding us for that with uh new work and uh and also in uh in the scores, satisfaction scores they're giving us which translates to future new work. So uh we're we we feel like we're in a very good uh good place there. And just looking at you know the the growth uh in your employees uh offshore, so India, um you know, you mentioned that that's uh uh reflect of the demand that you're seeing. So you know, can you speak to like the the your clients? Are they you know increasingly prioritizing offshore versus what they did in the past. And what's the underlying driver of that? Is it is it cost? Is there is there something else that's that's driving it? Capabilities perhaps? No, I think uh I think uh for for a a lot of uh reasons. Th'eres some in uh some companies that hadn't gone to leveraging offshore and when the pandemic happened and everybody went remote, both uh both onshore and offshore, it it gave them a view that maybe some of that uh some of that could work. And so I think it's just some catch up by uh by some of those players. I I I'd add at the same time, uh given the pandemic, those that were heavily, heavily in offshore uh look to rebalance some of that. So but but on average, you know, if you're if you're rebalancing some of it versus you're going from zero to to something, uh the the the move to offshore is outweighing it. It's also that operational efficiency. There's uh there there are operational efficiencies uh to be gained in uh in in leveraging offshore and and of course that's uh given kind of what the outlook is for for cost, uh we see some of that. But you know, it's uh it's something that uh we'll continue to uh to leverage. Uh and and just to remind you, we're gonna stay true to our proximity model even as we leverage global delivery. Okay. Thank you. I'll pass on. Yep. Your next question comes from Stephanie Price from CIBC. Please go ahead. Good morning. Hi, Stephanie. Hi. Um, I was hoping that you could touch just on the percentage of bookings from new clients. It was very strong in the quarter. Just curious about what's driving the strength and if you've made any changes to the sales process Yeah, thanks, uh thanks Stephanie. Uh as I mentioned we have made investments on uh on the talent side and uh in both the technology uh reskilling, upskilling, and also the certifications, as I mentioned, on alliance partners. So that gives us another channel uh to uh to reach some of the the newer clients. Also, we're making investments on the uh industry expertise and the consulting skills. That's another new avenue for us to uh generate uh those new clients. So those are kind of two of the uh investments that uh that we've been making and will continue to make that's uh that's driving some of those uh those new client uh logos. Thanks. And then maybe one uh for Francois. Cash flow came in a little bit below street expectations in the quarter or in a little bit below prior year as a percentage of revenue. Just curious if you could talk about and put some tapes here and how we should be thinking about modeling cash flow for the rest of the year. Yeah. So thanks uh Stephanie for a question. Uh yeah, a as I indicated, you know, uh last year we had a very strong cash flow, close to six hundred million just in a quarter. And and really was the fact that last year because of COVID, you know, we had a lot less uh uh uh uh bonuses, uh year end bonuses to pay last year uh in the first quarter. So uh versus uh twenty twenty one where we had uh you know uh a way better year on on bonuses and that had an impact on the quarterization or the the cash coming from from the first quarter. We're still uh I'm still convinced that uh we'll be capable to generate uh you know the the right level of cash like last year and even perhaps a a bit uh better than last year. Uh so so uh you know it's it's just a timing uh on the cash side, but uh you know, still still pretty and you saw the DSO uh at forty five days and it's I think now it's the last five or six quarters uh that that we are at at our target of DSO so uh pretty uh uh pretty comfortable where we are with the cash generation. That's helpful colour. Thank you. And and your next question comes from Howard Long from Veritas. Please go ahead. George, you mentioned that um, you know, one of the ways you're developing IP and this has been for a while is to qu work with clients and just wanted to get a sense of what uh how how that's structured and how you share the costs. Um I know before, you know, you you did this a long time ago with with the big banks in Canada and now now as you're evolving and and working with more clients outside of Canada, how is that structure evolving as well? Thanks. Yeah, no, thanks for the for the question, Howard. It it really does uh uh vary. Um the the most uh the most typical uh opportunity though that we see is that the client uh actually provides some of the uh some of the industry uh expertise, obviously the use case, if you will, and uh and and of course then accelerates it through some of their uh quality assurance and and uh then piloting it. What they get from that is uh first mover status and uh and then of course we build some of those customizations and projectize it uh with CGI's investment and as a result they uh they get the long term maintenance benefits. So a lot of times it's really as simple as uh as that. And then they may pay us for some of the customizations directly and keep them outside of the product. And we're seeing that more and more. So there might be some uh some proprietary or specific elements that we decide up front would not go into the product, but they still get the leverage, kind of the platform nature of the product. That's that's typically the most uh the most uh uh used uh uh opportunity that we that we see. Others are but we've done the the other where we actually jointly put the money in and uh and then we we have a a royalty uh scheme that goes back to the the clients based on uh on new uh new wins and of course CGI in all cases owns the the rights to the uh to the IP but the uh but then the uh the client gets the the rights to to use it in uh in in a in a perpetuity. So that's uh that's typically how we uh we see those. We also see sometimes it's consortium. If it's a cost of doing business, which is kind of the opposite of uh first mover or proprietary nature of the of the business. It might be a cost, a regulatory cost of doing business, and everybody uh puts money in as equal partners, including CGI, but CGI uh runs, owns, and operates the IP for the consortium. So we see kind of um multiple models. And and that's pretty consistent across uh each of the geographies that we operate in. So that that that's a great explanation. Thanks for uh highlighting all the different structures. Um on the uh on on on the acquisitions, um just looking at um the revenue contribution, you know, from array and uh CMC and I know it's just one quarter, but um the the multiples, you know, uh they they look they look pretty good I guess compared to the the past acquisitions. Is there anything you'd like to call out there and um is it just you know maybe it's just uh acquisition specific or is there something about um the valuations um that you're seeing in in in um in the your uh targets? Yeah well valuations uh you know as we know over the last uh couple of years have uh have gone up and uh but we still are are interested in finding valuations that uh that we can make accretive to CGI in that first year and so uh yeah there you do see some of that. I would say though moving forward we're seeing valuations starting to favor EBITDA over growth. And uh I don't know if you're not gonna exactly Geor,ge. I think uh we we we saw a stabilization of of the uh of the valuation and and uh uh George is right, uh seeing a a bit more uh you know, concentration on on on the on the how much uh margin or e bit or e bit duh that uh the pat uh the company can bring in. So so uh uh yeah we are seeing a stabilization of it and so uh good opportunities uh for us. Well yeah that's uh that makes sense given uh I guess what's been going on in the market past few weeks. Exactly. Um yeah. Uh and then just maybe just one last one for Francois. Um just notice the uh in the quarter of PP and D spending you, know, ticking up. Um is that just kind of a return to normal, uh um, you know, tr uh investing again in physical facilities or could you just put a little more color to that? Yeah, yeah, I I I bet uh return to normal. You're you're totally right. Uh with with uh you know, people that uh start to come back uh to the offices, uh for for sure. We we started to do some some investment in in offices and all that, so so that's that's uh that's a part of it. And and some of it is also as as we know with with uh you know the supply chain in in some places that it's a little bit tougher we we can have some a bit of swing from from one quarter to the other uh with some of the delay. So so both of them. So yes, some of it is just uh you know um uh coming back to a normal investment level and some of it you can have some seasonality just uh because of the Okay, great. Next question comes from Kevin Kushneretney from Desjardins. Please go ahead. Yes, yep. Oh awesome. Perfect. Good morning. Um question for you, is there is there any sort of way to think about your your customer mix in terms of size? You know, sort of thinking about the split between enterprise, mid market, SMB. I'm wondering, you know, if maybe any recent change in focus, any opportunities or or ability to take a greater share of IT spend from smaller versus larger customers and just how do if that's the case, how would you think about the structure of your sales uh and consultant mix and the uh and the metro market strategy uh you know just to be aligned with how you're seeing the various uh and uh customer and markets. Yeah no thanks Kevin. Uh our our focus is primarily on enterprise uh clients. Uh we uh we feel that uh the value proposition that we can bring to them, the impact that we can have on them, uh particularly given our global footprint and our end to end services is in fact uh greatest and so that's really the the primary focus. In fact, if you look at uh some of those recent uh MA transactions, whether it's uh a Ray, DMC, and Unicode, they all have uh that same uh makeup of uh you know very large enterprise, at least one very large enterprise client that that generates uh a lot of their revenue. Um it does not mean that we do not uh take some of our IP and uh solutions to the uh to the medium sized business, not as much on the on the small side. And um but but it really uh the the primary focus is on uh is on enterprise and those uh those accounts that we can uh really again drive the uh the the highest value. And I I want to make sure you you recognize when we're talking about those metro markets, uh those metro markets are where those enterprise uh companies uh are are headquartered. It's not uh it's not uh looking at uh uh at metro markets where uh it's only uh going after a small or medium sized uh company. Very good. Thank thank you for that explanation. Uh maybe just one uh perhaps for for France Francois. Uh I know you don't disclose gross gross margin. Can you talk about trends there if you look year over year the split of manager IT versus consulting uh fifty fifty. It was fifty fifty a year ago as well. Um but what are you seeing on the on the sort of uh gross margin underlying trends um and how is that contributing to the uh to the e bit uh outperformance? Uh we we gross margin is is is very good uh and and improving since uh uh since uh last last year. Uh like uh uh George alluded before, uh utilization is very high, uh so that contributing to to to the to the gross uh margin. So uh no continue to be uh pretty uh pretty good on it and S DNA uh with with uh the the concentration the automation that we're pushing more and more uh and offshoring of some of the S GNA activities is also uh improving year over year and that's why you see uh the the E bit improvement. Super. Thanks very much. I'll uh I'll pass the line. Your next question comes from Daniel Chen from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Um good to see that you guys are still able to grow your team and your employee attrition rates are lower than the industry average. Any any color on why you're able to achieve this? Is it because you guys are paying Sure. Well I think the the the biggest uh reason for kind of where we uh where we're able to to to do that is our employee value proposition. Uh it includes significant stock ownership, the the 85%, uh the the investments we've been making in career development, the thirty three inc percentrease in training and development around reskilling, et cetera. These these are really some of the uh the the the reasons that uh that we have this, including our community involvement. Um it's really uh an attractor there. But but it goes one step further. We we recognize that we're in a uh a unique environment and so um we really focused on a few areas that uh to to keep that um not just the the the attrition down but also the attraction up. And uh and what we're doing on the attraction side is is really focused on who we recruit, uh where we recruit, and uh and how we recruit. And I think that's uh some of where you were talking about the who we recruit, uh higher concentration on college hires and also trainees that are coming from non traditional IT environments. So that's uh that's about twenty percent of our hires now. We have boot camps that then build the digital skills that they need. Where we recruit, yeah, yeah, proximity and uh and offshore, but also those onshore delivery centers. That's a better place to to recruit for us and uh and then a lower turnover rate. And we have thirty nine percent of our hires came from global delivery. And then it's how we recruit. Mentioned before that a third of our people come through employee referrals. Uh there are a stronger uh attraction to to C GI, but the people that refer them have a higher retention rate as well. Uh so we're really uh you know, we're really uh making sure that we invest to not just rest on the the employee value proposition that we have, but continue to uh to build in this uh current environment. Thanks for that, George. Uh as a follow up to that, given that twenty percent of your hires are from non traditional IT and uh from uh relatively junior members from college, would you say that the ramp up time for these employees might take a little bit longer than typical? Well though we do put them through uh we do th put them through boot camps, so there is uh a little bit of a ramp up and uh yet this is what we're doing today and you see that uh we're still able to uh to deliver the utilization and margins that you uh you see in our results in this quarter. And yet uh that's probably another lever as they uh as they come on board to uh to to increase uh the the utilization and margin going forward. Okay, that makes sense. Francois, you mentioned that you model um revenue synergies into your IP acquisitions where it's typically you've typically look to leverage uh value from cost energies. How about on the market, uh Metro market modeling side too? When you're looking at metro market acquisitions, are you also starting to model in revenue synergies given your view to bring in additional services uh as you make these acquisitions? Uh for sure. Especially, you know, uh when when uh we're we're investing in in uh metro markets where we're not necessarily there. Uh so most of the time it's because we want to buy uh relationships also and with clients and new clients and and so and that's what we did in the past in in some places. Uh so uh you know sometimes these uh smaller firms will have good relationship with with large clients, but not having the full capabilities that CGI has. And so by by coming and and and doing this merger, we are bringing the capabilities to to uh to this metro market and and with the relationship that we just uh bought, you know, we're capable to have some revenue synergies there. Great. Thank you. Julie, I think we've got time for one more question, please. Perfect. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey guys, this is Cassie Channel for Jason. Good morning. Uh I'll just, you know, quickly slip into questions. So my first one I just wanted to ask. You guys obviously had pretty strong bookings this quarter. You know, I think it's the fourth quarter of like LTM book to build, you know, greater than one dot one. Can you just talk about, you know, very briefly like the core drivers of this and the potential sustainability. So like can we expect this trend to continue, you know, maybe at least for the next couple of quarters given the strong demand environment that you guys, you know, are able to capitalize on. Thanks. Sure. Um Kathy, one one of the uh areas I I already talked about some of the investments that we're making to uh to drive some of the uh the new clients uh particularly around the uh some of the the digital skills and the global alliances as well as the uh industry skills and uh some of the the consulting growth. So that's uh that's one of the areas that's driving that is that uh uh that mix of of new clients that are coming in. Certainly IP as we move to uh to IP uh thirty uh will give us uh an opportunity as we increase those deal size. I talk about some of the investments that we're making there to uh to to uh to drive that. And then the last is really the operational excellence, you know, the this uh drive to um uh to to efficiencies by our clients. Um and a lot of that uh requires automation and the that offshore mix. And what we're doing around our managed services offering is building modernization into the operational excellence platform. That's driving, again, longer-term, larger deals. So we do believe that in in this environment we'll be able to sustain a strong book to bill. Okay, awesome. And then, you know, one final question from me. I know you you guys have talked a lot about, you know, the consulting investments that you guys are making and you know during the analyst day you guys talked about that fifteen to twenty percent revenue cager over the medium term, you know, your UniCo acquisition um obviously bolsters your capabilities there as well. And while you don't really break apart bookings or revenues like by consulting, you know, per se, you know, can you share any metrics on, you know, perhaps like how book to build for consulting is trending or any other details there. Thanks guys. Yep. So uh we don't break that out uh now so I don't have that number in front of me but I can tell you just in general, about ten percent of our SINC is now um in the C uh in the consulting side. So uh we're we're looking at uh that's kind of the the basis of what we'd like to continue to grow. Okay, awesome. Thanks guys. Take care. Okay. Okay. Thanks everyone for participating.

      "reference" : "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to CGIs first quarter fiscal 2022 conference call.

I'll now turn it over to Francois to review our Q1 financials, and then George will comment on our business and market outlook. Francois. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to share with you the results of our first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our revenue continues to accelerate on a constant currency basis fueled by strong bookings from prior quarters, along with continued demand for our digital services and business solutions. In addition, we delivered double digit TPS growth despite a strong Canadian dollar causing headwinds in our reporting currency. We reported revenue of 3.1 billion dollars, up 6.8% year-over-year on the constant currency basis. Strong constant currency growth was seen in the following segments: Asia Pacific up 19.5%; Western and Southern Europe, up 15.2%; US commercial and State government, up 14.5%; Central and Eastern Europe, up 11.9%; and Canada, up 8eight. 3%. Total bookings were 3.6 billion dollars, representing a book-to-bill of 116.5% for the quarter and listing our trailing 12 months book-to-bill to 115.2% compared to 103% for the prior year. I would like to call out a few segments with strong bookings in the quarter: Scandinavia at 117%; the UK and Australia at 122.%; and Finland, Bowland, and Baltics with a book-to-bill of 353%, driven by our new eight-year managed services contracts fined with the finished government whereby CGI will serve as the largest provider of hybrid IT services to dozens of public sector organizations. In addition, yesterday, we announced an award by the US Department of Justice for a $250 million US Dollar blanket purchase agreement with the first task quarter already granted, for a value of $134 million US Dollars for approximately $170 million in Canadian dollars. Out of our eight proximity geographic segments, six now have a trailing 12 months booked to bill well above 100%. New business was 33% of bookings, an increase from the previous year's 28%. On a trailing 12 months basis, new business was also 33% as compared to 26% for the year ago period. Our global backlog increased to… by $808 million dollars year-over-year and remains strong at $23.6 billion dollars. This backlog represents 1.9 times revenue, the vast majority of which is comprised of longterm managed services and digital transformations engagements. Given the continued increased demand for our services as reflected by the strong bookings in the last few quarters, we expect continued positive momentum. On the profitability front, adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was $521.5 million dollars, while EBITDA margins increased to 16.9%, up 50 basis points compared to Q1 last year. The year-over-year increase inaudible was mainly due to revenue growth in IT services and solutions and improved utilization primarily within the Western and Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and US Federal segments. In addition, we continue to benefit from stronger margins due to operational excellence. We delivered strong EBITDA margins in the following segments: Asia Pacific at 32.1%; Canada at 25.6%; UK and Austria la at 15.8%; and Western and Southern Europe at 15.4%. Due to the strength of our value proposition to clients, and our embedded indexation clauses with our co… uh, with- within our contracts, we have largely been able to absorb wage and other cost pressures in our pricing. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 25.5% compared to 25.9% in the prior year. We continue to expect our tax rate for future quarters to be in the range of 24.5 to 26.5%. Net earnings were $367 million dollars and inaudible earnings per share were $1 dollar and .49 cents, representing an increase of 12.9% year-over-year. This improvement was mainly due to revenue growth and EBITDA margins improvements as outlined earlier. Excluding inaudible costs, net earning were $369 million dollars, for a margin of 11.9% and inaudible earnings per share were $1 dollar and .50 cents, an incretion of 12.8% when compared to $1 dollar and .33 cents in the same quarter last year. End of quarter, cast provided by operating activities were… was $484 million dollars compared to $597 million dollars in the prior year, which had reviews of our inaudible compensation payments related to the impact of the pandemic. As a prospectus of revenue, our cash iteration was strong at 15.7%. The DSO was four… 45 days compared to 44 days last year, aligned with our targets. For the last 12 months, cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion dollars, or 16.4% of revenue. This represents $8 dollars and .02 cents in cash per share. End of quarter, we invested $206 million dollars in our build and buy profitable growth strategy, mainly in, uh, our IT and for the acquisition of inaudible Management Consulting and inaudible. In addition, we used $267 million dollars to buy back our stock. Buying back CGI stock has been an accretive and flexible way to return capital to shareholders. As such, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved the extension of the NCIB Program until February 2023, allowing us to purchase up to 18.8 million shares over the next 12 months. In addition, we reimbursed $250 million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter, leaving only $50 million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of fiscal 2022. For the assurance of our senior notes in September 2021, CGIs weighted average maturity is now 4.9 years, with 100% fixed interest, uh, fixed interest rate at very favorable rates. Consistent with previous years, we review our capitals allocation plan to formulate the most effective capital deployment strategy to maximize shareholder returns. In Q1, we delivered a return on invested capital of 15.3%, a significance increase when compared to fif… 12.4% in the year ago period, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, as… and as indicated during our Investor Day this past November, our cash allocation priority remains the same; investing in our business, pursuing accretive acqu- acquisition, and buying back our stock. With a net debt to capitalization ratio of 27.8% at the end of December, as well as $2.7 billion dollars of cash readily available, and access to more if needed, CGI has the strength and capital resources to support our build and bi-profitable growth strategy. Now, I will turn the call to George to further discuss the insights and also for our business end markets. George. Thank you, Francois, and good morning everyone. I am pleased with our teams strong first quarter financial performance. We started fiscal year 2022 with positive momentum in all key metrics: double digit EPS accretion; accelerated revenue growth on a year-over-year and substantial quarter basis; robust bookings for the quarter in the last 12 months; and cash from operations of 15.7% for the quarter. The continued strength of our financial performance is grounded in our consultants ability to earn clients trust every day. This is evident in our modernization and digitization wins in the quarter. For example, Fannie Mae extended our longterm partnership in the US. We were awarded new work to support their migration to the Cloud and implement intelligent automation and data analytics across all consumer and commercial lines of business. inaudible, a recognized pioneer in health and care and social services in Finland has expanded their relationship with CGI to assist in completing their Goggle Cloud-based transformation. This engagement aims to help optimize costs and increase business agility. The Quebec Government selected CGI to help them establish and operate a new government Cloud for the next three years. On completion, this Cloud environment will be delivering services to multiple government agencies serving over eight million citizens. Elektroskandia, the Swedish electrical wholesaler which is a company of Sonepar, the world's largest electrical products, systems, and services firm named CGI as their digital transformation partner to support their modernization efforts, including the implementation of SAP S\/ 4 HANA. The French Agency for ecological transition chose CGI to deliver application services, agile scale, and DevOps to help modernize their take… technology capabilities and services, supporting over three million businesses. And in the UK, the University of Nottingham awarded CGIs a new consulting services agreement. Through this partnership, we'll help modernize their digital value chain and support of learning services for over 45,000 students and 7,000 employees. Our robust bookings in the quarter were led by awards from government sector clients, up 28% year-over-year, for a book-to-bill of 151%. We expect this uptick to continue given the governments around the world are reprioritizing their IT initiatives in line with the evolving public health and economic environment. On a sequential quarter basis, we also saw demand accelerate in the financial services sector, resulting in a nearly 40% increase in Q1 bookings and a book-to-bill of 114%. This was driven by client demand for digital services across all geographic segments. In addition to our strong performance, clients continue to recognize the depth and breadth of our knowledge and expertise, resulting in all time high client satisfaction scores. Notably, our two highest client satisfaction scores measure how we partner with clients; specifically, our level of commit, collaboration, and communication. These qualities are key elements of the world class delivery excellence for which CGI is known. In fact, client executives often raise these qualities as some of the most important priorities for their partner selection and site them as differentiators for CGI. As a people center firm, we also recognize that our success is founded on the strength of our consultants and professionals, 85% of whom are CGI shareholders. Our employee satisfaction scores also continue to be it record high levels. This is primarily due to our ongoing investments in digital tooling, self and wellbeing, and employee development. These are critical elements to provide rapid career growth for our talented employees and are therefore instrumental to our overall employee retention. As such, our voluntary attrition rates remains below the IT services industry average. Now as outlined during our recent Investor and Market Analyst Day, client demand for end-to-end digitization remains the key driver for CGIs planned profitable growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. During that meeting we shared four areas of investment with annual and three year objectives. First and foremost, an industry knowledge to help clients in their quest to build their right future. In technology expertise to support them… bright future and technology expertise to support them in building it right and offering intellectual property assets, enabling them to build with speed. And finally, the operational excellence to help clients operate and evolve their planned future estate. Today I'll provide updates on each of these areas, starting with the right industry knowledge. We announce our plan to grow strategic business and IT consulting services revenue by 15 to 20% on a compound annual growth rate basis over the next three years. In the quarter, we saw an uptick in consulting in the systems integration demand as bookings increase by over $100 million compared with this time last year. This is due, in part, to the expansion of our local consulting practices and related increased investment in hiring and developing industry expertise. In fact, we are finalizing a new white paper which consolidates input from our board of directors, CGI industry experts, and external alliance partners to explore the key trends that will impact and shape the long-term trajectories of most global industries. Our consultants will be sharing this paper with our clients to help inform their strategic planning, and we will then discuss with clients how CGI can best support their business objectives. Our next area of investment, technology expertise, helps clients balance the potential technology with the reality of complex enterprise delivery. We previously announced our fiscal 2022 plan to increase employee training and digital technologies by 33%. A key mechanism for supporting this plan is CGI's online university, worth 35% of employees completed courses in Q1. This training enables rapid reskilling and upskilling in areas of high demand, which is scaled agile and cloud technologies. Also, in support of our technical expertise investment, we plan to add over 15,000 employee certifications of global alliance partner solutions over the next three years. So far this year, we've already surpasses 2,100 of these certifications. This has contributed to a 15% increase in bookings with our global alliance partners on a year over year basis. Leveraging our investments in intellectual property, we also announced our plan to reach 30% of our revenue derived from IP by 2025. In the first quarter, IP services and solutions accounted for 22% of revenue, up from 21% last quarter. Investments in IP globally are focused on deploying new value add capabilities across the existing IT portfolio as well as investing to cocreate with clients on new innovations for bringing in greater value to clients' digital transformation and add to CGI's IT portfolio. Most importantly, our plans for operational excellence are a critical elements our clients are looking for, not only for us to be a safe pair of hands, but also for us to deliver in a cost-efficient manner. The support delivery and operational excellence objectives, the three-year plan we announce includes increasing head account by 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis across all of our global delivery centers particularly in India. In Q1, our current hiring pace in India is almost two and a half times more than before the pandemic. This hiring contributed to the 20% year to year growth in our Asia Pacific operations. Given CGI's strong value proposition, our attrition rate in India stands well below the India peer group average. For our ability to deliver these results is ensuring we have the right talent in both our client proximity and global delivery operations. Over the past few months, we've continued to evolve our hiring strategies to meet increasing client demand. In Q1, the number of new hires more than doubled compared to this time last year. The end of the quarter, with 82,000 employees, a year-over-year net increase of 6,000 consultants and professionals. We continue to employ an effective and efficient talent attraction and onboarding approach, with two-thirds of candidates coming directly to CGI either through referrals from current employees or through direct applications for open positions on cgi.com. In addition, to support our proactive recruiting outreach, we've increased our recruiting capacity across all operating units. Our operational leaders, the same leaders who are responsible for client delivery, are involved in candidate sourcing, assessment, and decision-making at every step of our hiring process. This ensures tight alignment between candidate skills and client needs and reduces overall time to fill open, fillable positions. In moving to the growth outlook for the rest of the year, we expect client demand for end to end digitization to continue accelerating across most of the key industries we serve. In government, as I stated earlier, we see positive client demand momentum, particularly in areas well aligned to CGI's positioning and offerings. This includes helping agencies address, arrange a domestic priorities, spanning social and health services, infrastructure, space-based data solution, environment and the climate, and cybersecurity. In manufacturing, supply chain disruptions continue to require reshaping and reconfiguration. This is driving demand for data-driven enterprises to improve service quality and generate new revenue streams through use of digital services, including AI and advanced analytics. In retail and consumer services, the permanent shift to more digital orders is requiring prioritization of omni channel investments, while supply chain challenges are creating pressure on customer service and loyalty, driving demand of AI and predictive analytics to improve forecasting, inventory management, and workforce planning. And in financial services, banks are aggressively implementing their digital transformational agendas to better understand their customers and improve organizational performance. Banking client initiatives now often include, if not hinge on faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency… include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, Faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. That, um, decision, um, is that maybe a function of just, you know, the, the many opportunities that you see as inaudible cap allocation for the upcoming year? Yeah, thanks, inaudible. It's Francois. I'll take this one. Uh, you're right, uh, you know, and, and that's, uh, what we indicated, uh, at the, uh, investor day. You know, uh, we feel that, you know, the acquisition and many activities, uh, uh, will be a lot more active this year. Uh, we're talking a- about allocating a billion, uh, on, on this, and, and that we're on a right path, uh, for now, so, so, uh, and what we're seeing is that, uh, we, we think that we'll be able to achieve at this objective. So, uh, that's why we thought that, again, uh, to wait, uh, uh, again, for, for the dividend. Uh, we as, as indicated, uh, we did, uh, we will renew our NCIB, so, uh, you know, if needed, we will put some, some investment in the, uh, in the short buyback. But, uh, we think that the, you know, uh, versus this, versus last year, uh, a lot more in the inaudible. Okay. Uh, thank you, Francois. George, crosstalk could you just talk a little bit? You, you touched in it in the comments on the IP solutions, but maybe talk about where you've been and, and the journey of sort of globalizing more of the solutions. I know about a year ago this time, you started down that path. Maybe give us an update on how you see things trending. Yup, no, it's a, it's a great question, because, uh, you're right. We, uh, I call it our, our unified approach to, uh, to growing IP, and, uh, it really is first and foremost about having processed the methodology to propagate the existing IP across the entire, uh, channel of, uh, CGI. So, uh, this is everything from approved value proposition through add-ons to our existing IP, broader target market, across industries, geographies, and functions in, and having a, a more efficient and, uh, profitable, uh, delivery model. So just to give you a quick update in the quarter, uh, we do have over 10% increase in the pipeline. We have an over 10% increase in the deal size of the bookings that we have. So that's… that gets to that, uh, improved value, uh, proposition and that broader, uh, delivery mechanism, and then we have an over 10% increase in the win rate. So those are some nice early proof points, um, that say that what we're doing around that propagation is, uh, is working. Uh, in fact, we have three of our SBUs that are art the 30%, and, uh, and the two fastest growing are the ones that are under 10%. So we have a, we have opportunity and, uh, and of course, uh, propagating that IP is the way to get there. Uh, we're also making increased investments in the sourcing the new IP. So this is, uh, everything from ideation from our industry experts, so that's, uh, that's showing some, uh, some signs of, uh, of opportunity, cocreating with clients. Sometimes we actually cocreate and acquire the IP from our clients. Sometimes we actually just cocreate and jointly own it and everything in it between. That's where a lot of our best IPs actually came from. And so we, uh, we're doing that across, uh, the global CGI now. And then as I mentioned in the, uh, opening remarks, uh, MNA, uh, is, is an area where we're gonna be looking at, um, uh, IP services and solutions firms, uh, not just software only but services and solutions firms. Uh, we're opening the, uh, the aperture to more of that and our MNA. So, uh, you know, early returns are, are coming, and, uh, we're, we're bullish on the future. Great. And then just the one final one from me, just around maybe more quarterly matters here, either you or Francois. Could you talk about… you mentioned client contract adjustments mainly in the UK and Australia. You mentioned a little bit in Scandinavia, but just, you know, obviously, this is always sort of a inaudible, but where we are in the process of sort of running off, um, maybe those adjustments for those engagements and ramping other stuff. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, thanks, I'll, I'll take it, uh, Paul. So, so for, for UK, clearly, it was a, you know, a one… a nonrecurring adjustment that, uh, had an impact on, on their, uh, on their growth and contribution. So, so that's behind us, and, and so you can expect, uh, to, to, to have a margin and, and the revenue picking up in the next, uh, few quarters in for UK. And, and same thing for, for, uh, in, in the, uh, Scandinavia, we, we, we have some, some, you know, operational issue that we need to resolve in, in Scandinavia, but we had also nonrecurring, uh, one-time adjustment that, uh, uh, are, uh, behind us and, uh, expecting that, uh, also there we'll see some, some growth in the contribution. Perfect. Thank you. It's our next call. The next question comes from Richard C. from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead. Hello. Can you hear me? crosstalk Yeah, we can hear you now, Richard? <laugh> Uh, just, uh, wanted to get a bit of perspective in terms of the, the operating level of a, of a business, you know, compared to pre-pandemic. Like, are utilization rates, um, kind of back to where they've been? Like, I'm try- trying to get a bit of understanding on that. Yeah, um, actually, our utilization rates are a little bit stronger than they were, uh, pre-pandemic. Uh, and, and part of that is that, uh, the strong demand, uh, side that we see, but also the opportunity we took, uh, right at the beginning of the, uh, pandemic to take the actions that we felt necessary. So, uh, we, we measure the utilization on a weekly basis. Uh, obviously not just with reports but in a call that I have with all the operating leaders. So, uh, we're very focused on it, and, and I'm pleased to, to tell you that it's, uh, it's actually a little bit above where we were pre-pandemic. Okay. And then, um, obviously, you're in pretty constant contact with your accounts and clients. What are they saying about IT budgets, um, going into 2022, you know, particularly, you know, how-… um, going into 2022, you know, particularly, you know, how much higher they are or lower they are, and kind of areas of priorities where they wanna spend. Yeah, it's a, it's a good question. Obviously. Uh, everybody's got, uh, slightly different, uh, planning periods. But, uh, in general, uh, in, in areas like financial services, we see, uh, those budgets continuing to, to go up. And, and across the board, the focus is on both, uh, growing their revenue, but, and using technology to help do that. And, uh, and, and some client facing, uh, solutions in, in their, uh, in their IT budgets, but also focused on that operational efficiency. Uh, we hear our clients t- talking about, they have, uh, they're dealing with, uh, the current, uh, economic, uh, uh, pricing pressures and, and looking to make sure that they stay competitive through operational efficiencies. Technology, as you know, plays on both sides. It plays on the, uh, on the upside, on the revenue side, but technology also plays on the, uh, operational efficiencies. So we, we see a pretty strong environment for, uh, for IT. And, uh, I've been talking for a while, Richard, this, uh, you know, this wasn't just pent up demand that we saw, uh, coming out of the, the pandemic. It's, it's, it's something we think is sustainable from an IT perspective. Okay. And just one last quick one for me. Uh, you know, on the acquisition side, uh, you talked about opening up the aperture for technology. Historically, uh, you guys have been more sort of value conscious. And so when you look at, you know, technology type deals, no doubt the, uh, evaluations are certainly a bit more robust, uh, despite maybe the pullback here at the beginning of the year. So, how, how do you look at sort of the relative valuation you're kind of willing to pay for these? And maybe give us a bit of perspective o- on that. Yeah. May- maybe I'll, I'll start, and then I'll ask, uh, Francois to, uh, to continue. Just to, to remind you, uh, we are looking to make these acquisitions accretive. And so, uh, we're, we're very conscious of not, uh, overpaying. Having said that, if the value is there, we're willing to pay higher multiples. So I don't know if Francois if- Yeah. Uh, and, and you know, where we're, to some point conservative in our acquisition where, you know, we, when we're building our return, we're building it a lot of times with, with cost energies, you know, for sure in IP, we need to, to, to be convinced that we will have revenue synergies and, and so meaning, uh, expecting, uh, rev- uh, a lot more revenue increase coming from, from these, uh, acquisition. And, and we have now the channel across the world to do what… So, so for sure, what we are looking at is IP that, uh, can be sold across the world, uh, without, no, too much changes. And, and so for sure, you know, it will be valued a bit more, but we naturally with the return that we think we can enable, we don't have any problem to, to pay, uh, to pay the, the right price. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from Paul Trevor from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thanks very much, and good morning. crosstalk. I just wanna touch on, uh, you know, CGIs growth relative to, to the market in, in peers. And now maybe this is in an apples to apples comparison, um, but some of your peers have reported quite strong growth recently. I just wanted your thoughts on, you know, what's your view on CGIs growth, you know, just relative to those peers and, and the market? And do you feel like, you know, you're matching, you're exceeding, um, or, or lagging the, the, the growth of peers in the markets that you're in? Yeah, thanks for the question, uh, Paul. Look, we, we like where we are in our profitable revenue growth, uh, current landscape, but also where where we're, where we're headed towards. Uh, very, very proud of the fact that, uh, we've been able to take this, the, uh, growth that we are achieving both, uh, through the build and the buy and, uh, and drop that to earnings, uh, per share accretion double digits here in the first quarter. So we, we like where we are on, uh, where we're getting that growth and, uh, and what the outlook is. And you see that outlook based on the, uh, the strong book the bill again, this quarter and for the trailing 12 months. So, we feel like we're in a very good, um, uh, position to continue to, uh, accelerate our growth through both the build and the buy. And, uh, and like I said, our clients are rewarding us for that with, uh, new work. And, uh, and also in, uh, in the scores, satisfaction scores are giving us, which translates to future new work. So, uh, we, we feel like we're in a very good, uh, good place there. And just looking at, you know, the, the growth, uh, in your employees, uh, offshore, so India, um, you know, you mentioned that that's, uh, uh, reflective the demand that you're seeing. So, you know, can you speak to like the, your clients, are they in- increasingly prioritizing offshore versus what they did in the past? And what's the underlying driver of that? Is it, is it cost, is there, is there something else that's, that's driving the capabilities perhaps? No, I think, uh, I think, uh, for, for a lot of reasons, there's some in, uh, some companies that hadn't gone to leveraging offshore. And when the pandemic happened and everybody went remote, both, uh, both onshore and offshore, it, it gave them a view that maybe some of that, uh, some of that could work. And so I think it's just some catch up by, uh, by some of those players. I, I'd add at the same time, uh, given the pandemic, those that were heavily, heavily in offshore, uh, looked to rebalance some of that. So, but, but on average, you know, if you're, if you're rebalancing some of it versus you're going from zero to, to something, uh, the, the, the moved offshore is outweighing it. It's also that operational efficiency. There's the, there, there are operational efficiencies, uh, to be gained in, uh, in, in leveraging offshore. And, and of course that's, uh, given kind of what the outlook is for, for cost. Uh, we see some of that. But, you know, it's, uh, it's something that, uh, will continue to, uh, to leverage. Uh, and, and just to remind you, we're gonna stay true to our proximity model, even as we leverage global delivery. Yeah, thank you. I'll pass the line. Yep. Your next question comes from Stephanie Price from CIBC. Please, go ahead. Good morning. Hi, Stephanie. Hi. Um, I was hoping that you could touch just on the percentage booking from new clients. It was very strong in the quarter. Just curious about what's driving the strength and if you've made any changes for the sales process. Yeah. Thanks. Uh, thanks Stephanie. As I mentioned, we have made investments on, uh, on the talent side and, uh, in both the technology, uh, reskilling, upskilling, and also the certifications, as I mentioned on alliance partners. So that gives us another channel, uh, to, uh, to reach some of the, the newer clients. Also, we're making investments on the, uh, industry expertise and the consulting skills. That's another new avenue for us to, uh, generate, uh, those new clients. So those are kind of two of the, uh, investments that, that we've been making and will continue to make that's, uh, that's driving some of those, uh, those new client logos. Thanks. And then maybe one, uh, for Francois. Cash flow came in a little bit below street expectations in the quarter and a little bit below prior years percentage revenue. Just curious if you could talk about what it takes here and how we should be thinking about modeling cashflow for the rest of the year. Yeah. So thanks. Uh, Stephanie for a question. Uh, yeah, as I indicated, you know, uh, last year we had a very strong cashflow close to 600 million just in a quarter. And, and really was the fact that last year, because of COVID, you know, we had a lot less, uh, uh, bonuses, uh, year end bonuses to pay last year, uh, in the first quarter. So, uh, versus 2021, where we had the, you know, uh, a way better year on, on bonuses and that had an impact on the quarterization or the, the cash coming from, from the first quarter. We're still, uh, I'm still convinced that, uh, we'll be capable to generate, uh, you know, the, the right level of cash, like last year and even perhaps a bit better than last year. Uh, so, so, uh, you know, it's, it's just a timing, uh, on the cash side, but, uh, you know, still, still pretty… And you saw the DSO, uh, at 45 days, and it's, I think now it's the last five or six quarters, uh, that, that we are at our target of DSO. So, uh, pretty, uh, a pretty comfortable where we are with the cash generation. That's helpful color. Thank you. And, and your next question comes from Howard Leung from Veritas. Please, go ahead. Th- th- thank you so much for, uh, for taking the questions. Uh, I, I'll just like to start with, um, the one about IP, uh, George, you mentioned that, um, you know, of the ways you're developing IP and this has been for a while, is to work, work with clients. And just wanted to get a sense of what, uh, how, how that's structured and how you share the costs. Um, I know before, you know, you, you did this a long time ago with, with the big banks in Canada. And now, now as you're evolving and, and working with more clients outside of Canada, how we inaudible evolving as well? Thanks. Yep. No, thanks for the, for the question, Howard. It, it really does, uh, uh, vary. Um, the, the most, uh, the most typical, uh, opportunity though that we see is that the client, uh, actually provides some of the, uh, some of the industry, uh, expertise, obviously the use case, if you will. And, uh, and, and of course then accelerates it through some of their, uh, quality assurance and, uh, and then piloting it. What they get from that is, uh, first mover status. And, uh, and then of course we build some of those customizations and productize it, uh, with CGI's investment. And as a result, they, uh, they get the long term maintenance benefits. So, a lot of times it's really as simple as, uh, as that. And then they may pay us for some of the customizations directly and keep them outside of the product. And we're seeing that more and more. So there might be some, uh, some proprietary or specific elements that we decide up front would not go into the product, but they still get the leverage kind of the platform nature of the product. That's, that's typically the most, uh, the most, uh, uh, used, uh, o- opportunity that we, that we see. Others are, but we've done the other where we actually jointly put the money in. And, uh, and then we, we have a royalty, uh, scheme that goes back to the, the clients based on, uh, on new, uh, new wins. And of course, CGI in all cases owns the, the rights to the, uh, to the IP, but the, uh, but then the, uh, the client gets the, the rights to, to use it in, uh, in, in a, in a perpetuity. So that's, uh, that's typically how we, uh, how we see those. We also see sometimes its consortium. If it's a cost of doing business, which is kind of the opposite of, uh, first mover or proprietary nature of the, of the business, it might be a cost of regulatory cost of doing business. And everybody, uh, puts money in as equal partners, including CGI, but CGI, uh, runs, owns and operates the IP or the consortium. So we see kind of, um, multiple models. And, and that's pretty consistent across, uh, each of the geographies that we operate in. So that, that, that's a great explanation. Thanks for, uh, highlighting all the different- Yep. structures. Um, on the, uh, on, on, on the acquisitions, um, just looking at, um, the revenue contribution, you know, from array and, uh, CMC. And I know it's just one quarter, but, um, the, the multiples, you know, uh, they, they look, they look pretty good, I guess, compared to the, the past acquisitions. Is there anything you'd like to call out there and, um, is it just, you know, maybe it's just, uh, acquisition specific or is there some thing about, um, the valuations, um, that you're seeing in, in, in, um, in the, your, uh, targets? Yeah, well, valuations, uh, you know, as we know over the last, uh, couple years have, uh, have gone up and, uh, but we still are, are interested in finding valuations that, uh, that we can make accretive to CGI in that first year. And so, uh, yes, there, you do see some of that. I would say though, moving forward, we're seeing valuations starting to favor EBITDA over growth. And uh, I don't know, Francois- Yeah, no, e- exactly, George. I think, uh, we, we saw a stabilization of, of the, of the valuation. And, and, uh, George's right, this thing, a bit more, uh, you know, concentration on, on, on the, on the how much, uh, margin or EBI- or EBITDA that, uh, the, the company can bring in. So, so, uh, uh, yeah, we are seeing stabilization of it. And so, uh, the opportunities, uh, for us. Oh, yeah. That, uh, that makes sense given, uh, I guess what's been going on in the market past few weeks. Exactly. Um, yeah. Uh, and then just, maybe just one last one for Francois, um, just noticed the, uh, in the quarter of PP&D spending, you know, ticking up. Um, is that just kind of a return to normal, uh, um, you know, t- t- uh, investing again in physical facilities, or could you just put a little more color to that? Yeah, yeah. I, I bet the return to normal. You're, you're totally right. Uh, with, with, uh, you know, people that, uh, start to come back to the officers for, for sure, we, we started to do some, some investment in, in offices and all that. So, so that, that's a, that's a part of it. And, and some of it is also as, uh, as we know, with, with, uh, you know, the supply chain in, in some places that it's a little bit tougher, we, we can have some, a bit of swing from, from one quarter to the other, uh, with some of the delay. So, so both of them. So yes, some of it is just, uh, you know, uh, coming back to a, a normal investment level and some of it, you can have some seasonality just, uh, because of-… level. And some of it, you can have some seasonality just, uh, because of the… Some- some supply chains, uh, I… uh, issues. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for the colorized, uh, I'll turn it back. Your next question comes from Kevin Kushner Abne from Busan Bank. Please go ahead. Uh, good morning, gentlemen. Can you hear me? Yes. Yep. Hi Kevin. Oh, awesome. Perfect. Good morning. Um, question for you, is there, is there any sort of way to think about your- your customer mix in terms of size, you know, sort of thinking about the split between enterprise mid-market, SMB, I'm wondering, you know, if maybe any recent change in focus, any opportunities or- or ability to take a greater share of IT spend from smaller versus larger customers and just how to investigate how would you think about the structure of your sales, uh, and consultant mix and the, uh, and the metro market strategy, uh, you know, just to be aligned with how you're seeing the various, uh, and, uh, customer end markets. Yeah, no, thanks Kevin. Uh, our- our focus is primarily on enterprise, uh, clients. Uh, we, uh, we feel that, uh, the value proposition that we can bring to them, the impact that we can have on them, uh, particularly given our global footprint and our end to end services is in fact, uh, greatest. And so that's really the- the primary focus. In fact, if you look at, uh, some of those recent, uh, M&A transactions, whether it's a Array, DMC and Unico, they all have, uh, that same, uh, makeup of, uh, you know, very large enterprise, at least one very large enterprise client that- that generates, uh, a lot of their revenue. Um, it does not mean that we do not, uh, take some of our IP and, uh, solutions to the, uh, the medium size business, not as much on the, on the small side. And, um… But- but it really, uh, the- the primary focus is on, uh, is on enterprise and those, uh, those accounts that we can, uh, really again, drive the, uh, the highest value. And I- I wanna make sure you- you recognize when we're talking about those metro markets, uh, those metro markets are where those enterprise, uh, companies, uh, are- are headquartered. It's not, uh, it's not, uh, looking at, uh- uh, at metro markets where, uh, it's only, uh, going after a smaller, medium sized, uh, company. Very good. Thanks- thank you for that explanation. Uh, maybe just one, uh, perhaps for prevent Sprintlaw. Uh, I know you don't disclose gross- gross margin. Can you talk about trends there? If I look year over year, the split of manager IT versus consulting, uh, is 50, 50, of this 50, 50 a year ago as well. Um, but what are you seeing on the, on sort of a gross margin, underlying trends, um, and how is that contributing to the, uh, to the EBIT, uh, outperformance? Well, wi- with gross margin is- is- is very good, uh, and- and improving since, uh- uh, since, uh, last- last year. Uh, like, uh, George alluded before, uh, utilization is very high, uh, so like contributing to- to- to the, to the gross, uh, margin. So, uh, they'll continue to be, uh, pretty, uh, pretty good on it. And SG&A, uh, with- with, uh, the- the concentrate, the automation that we're pushing more and more. A- and offshoring up of some of the SG&A activities is also, uh, improving year over year. And that's why you see, uh, the- the EBIT improvement. Super thanks very much. I'll, uh, I'll pass the line. Your next question comes from Daniel Chan from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Um, good to see that you guys are still able to grow your team and your employee attrition rates are lower than the industry average. Any- any color on why you're able to achieve this? Is it because you guys are paying more or is it based on the locations where you're, uh, operating out of any color would be helpful? Sure. Uh, well, I think the- the- the biggest reason for kind where we, uh, where we're able to- to- to do that is our employee value proposition. Uh, it includes significant stock ownership, the 85%. Uh, the- the investments we've been making in career development, the 33% increase in training development around rescaling et cetera. These- these are really some of the, uh, the- the- the reasons that, uh, that we have this, including our community involvement. Um, it is really a- an attractor there. But- but it goes one step further, we- we recognize that we're in a, uh, a unique environment. And so, um, we really focused on a few areas that, uh, to- to keep that, um, not just about the- the attrition down, but also the attraction up. And, uh, and what we're doing on the attraction side is- is really focused on who we recruit, uh, where we recruit and, uh, and how we recruit. And I think that's, uh, some of where you were talking about the, who we recruit, uh, higher concentration on college hires and also trainees that are coming from nontraditional IT environments. So that's, uh, that's about 20% of our hires. Now we have boot camps that then build the digital skills that they need. Where we recruit, yeah- yeah proximity and, uh, and offshore, but also those onshore delivery centers. That's a better place to- to recruit for us, and, uh, and then a lower turnover rate. And we have 39% of our hires came from, uh, global delivery. And then it's how we recruit, I've mentioned before that, uh, a third of our people come through employee referrals. Uh, they're- they're stronger, uh, attraction to- to CGI, but the people that refer them have a higher retention rate as well. Uh, so we're really, uh, you know, we're really, uh, making sure that we invest to not just rest on the- the employee value prep- proposition that we have, but continue to, uh, to build in this, uh, current environment. Thanks for that George. Uh, as a follow up to that, given that 20% of your hires are from non-traditional IT, and, uh, from, uh, relatively junior members from college, would you say that the ramp up time for these employees might take a little bit longer than typical? Although we do put them through, uh, we do put them through boot camps, so there is, uh, a little bit of a ramp up. And, uh, yet this is what we're doing today, and you see that, uh, we're still able to, uh, to deliver the utilization and margins that you, uh, you see in our results in this quarter. And yet, uh, that's probably another lever as they, uh, as they come on board to, uh, to- to increase, uh, the- the utilization and margin going forward. Okay. That makes sense. From… So you mentioned that you model, um, revenue synergies into your IP acquisitions, where it's typically you've typically looked to leverage, uh, value from cost synergies. How about market, uh, metro market modeling side two? When you're looking at metro market acquisitions, are you also starting to model in revenue synergies, given your view to bring in additional services, uh, as you make these acquisitions? Uh, for sure. And especially, you know, uh, when- when, uh, we're- we're investing in- in, uh, metro markets where we're not necessarily there. Uh, so most of the time it's because we want to buy, uh, relationships also and with clients and new clients. And- and so… And that's what we did in the past and in some places, uh, so, uh, you know, sometimes these, uh, smaller firms will have good relationship with- with large clients, but not having the full capabilities that CGI has. And so by- by coming and- and- and doing this merger, we are bringing the capabilities, uh, to- to, uh, to this metro market and- and with the relationship that we just, uh, bought, you know, we're capable to have some revenue synergies there. Great. Thank you. Julie. I think we've got time for one more question, please. Perfect. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey guys, this is Kathy Channon for Jason. Good morning. Uh, I'll just, you know, quickly slip into your questions. So my first one, I just wanted to ask, you guys obviously had pretty strong bookings this quarter. You know, I think it's the fourth quarter of like LTM book to bill, you know, greater than 1. 1. Can you just talk about, you know, very briefly, like the core drivers of this and the potential sustainability. So like, can we accept this trend to continue, you know, maybe at least for the next couple of quarters, given the strong demand from the environment that you guys, you know, are able to capitalize on. Thanks. Sure. Um, Kathy one- one of the, uh, areas I- I already talked about some of the investments that we're making to, uh… To drive some of the, uh, the new clients are particularly around the, uh, some of the- the digital skills and the global alliances, as well as the, uh, industry skills and, uh, some of the- the consulting growth. So that's, uh, that's one of the areas that's driving that is that, uh- uh, that mix of- of new clients that are coming in. Certainly IP as we move to, uh, to IP, uh, 30, uh, will give us, uh, an opportunity as we increase those deal size. I talk about some of the investments that we're making there to, uh, to- to, uh, to drive that. And then the last is really the operational excellence, you know, the- this, uh, drive to, um, uh, to- to efficient seized by our clients. Um, and a lot of that, uh, requires automation and the… that offshore mix. And what we're doing around our managed services offering is building modernization into the operational excellence, uh, platform. That's, uh, that's driving again, longer term larger deals. So, uh, we do believe that, uh, in- in this environment we'll be able to, uh, to sustain a strong book to bill. Okay, awesome. And then, you know, one final question from me. I know you- you guys have talked a lot about, you know, the consulting investments that you guys are making and, you know, during the Analyst Day, you guys talked about that 15 to 20% revenue CAGR over the medium term. You know, your Unico acquisition, um, obviously both with your capabilities there as well. And while you don't really break apart bookings or revenues, like by consulting, you know, per se, you know, can you share any metrics on, you know, perhaps like how book to bill for consulting is trending or any other details there? Thanks guys. Yep. So, uh, we don't break that out, uh, now, so don't have that number in front of me. But I can tell you just in general, about 10% of our SI&C is now, um, in the C uh, in the consulting side. So, uh, we're- we're looking at, uh, that's kind of the- the basis of what we'd like to continue to grow. Okay, awesome. Thanks guys, take care. Okay. Okay. Thanks everyone for participating.

      "withCtc" : "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to CGI's first quarter fiscal twenty twenty two conference call.

I'll now turn it over to Francois to review our Q1 financials and then George will comment on our business and market outlook. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to share with you the results of our first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty two. Our revenue growth continues to accelerate on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong bookings from prior quarters, along with continued demand for our digital services and business solutions. In addition, we delivered double digit EPS growth despite a strong Canadian dollar causing handwinds in our reporting currency. We recorded revenue of three point one billion dollars up six point eight percent year over year on a constant currency basis. Strong constant currency growth was seen in the following segments Asia Pacific up nineteen point five percent, Western and Southern Europe up fifteen point two percent. US commercial and state government up fourteen point five percent, Central and Eastern Europe up eleven point nine percent, and Canada up eight point three percent. Total bookings were three point six billion dollars, representing a book to bill of one hundred and sixteen point five percent for the quarter and lifting our trailing twelve months book to bill to one hundred and fifteen point two percent compared to one hundred and three percent for the prior year. I would like to call out a few segments with strong bookings in the quarter. Scandinavia at one hundred and seventeen percent. U TheK and Australia at one hundred and twenty two percent. And Finland, Poland and Baltics with a book to bill of three hundred and fifty three percent, driven by a new eight year managed services contract signed with the Finnish government, whereby CGI will serve as the largest provider of hybrid IT services to dozens of public sector organizations. In addition, yesterday we announced an award by the U.S. Department of Justice for a two hundred and fifty million US dollar blanket purchase agreement with the first task order already granted for a value of one hundred and thirty four million US dollars or approximately one hundred and seventy million in Canadian dollars. Out of our eight proximity geographic segments, six now have a trailing twelve months book to bill well above a hundred percent. New business was thirty-three percent of bookings, an increase from the previous year's twenty-eight percent. On a trelling twelve month basis, new business was also thirty-three percent as compared to twenty-six percent for their year-ago period. Our global backlog increased to by eight hundred and eight million dollars year over year and remained strong at twenty three point six billion dollars. This backlog represents one point nine times revenue, the vast majority of which is comprised of long term managed services and digital transformation engagement. Given the continued increase demand for our services, as reflected by the strong bookings in the last few quarters, we expect continuing positive momentum. On the profitability front, adjusted EBIT in T one was five hundred and twenty one point five million dollars while EBIT margins increased to sixteen point nine percent, up fifty basis points compared to Q one last year. The year over year increase was mainly due to revenue growth in IT services and solutions and improved utilization primarily within the Western and Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and US federal segments. In addition, we continue to benefit from stronger margins due to operational excellence. We delivered strong EBIT margins in the following segments Asia Pacific at thirty two point one percent, Canada at twenty five point six percent, UK and Australia at fifteen point eight percent and Western and southern Europe at fifteen point four percent. Due to the strength of our value proposition to clients and our embedded indexation clauses with our c i w within our contracts, we have largely been able to absorb wage and other cost pressures in our pricing. Our effective tax rate in Q one was twenty five point five percent compared to twenty five point nine percent in the prior year. We continue to expect our tax rate for future quarters to be in the range of twenty four point five to twenty six point five percent. And earnings were three hundred sixty seven million dollars in And diluted earnings per share were one dollar and forty nine cents, representing an increase of twelve point nine percent year over year. This improvement was mainly due to revenue growth and e-bet margins improvements as outlined earlier. Excluding integration costs and earnings were three hundred and sixty nine million dollars for a margin of eleven point nine percent, and diluted earnings per share were one dollar and fifty cents, an accretion of twelve point eight percent when compared to one dollar and thirty three cents in the same quarter last year. In the quarter, cash provided by operating activities were was four hundred e andighty four million dollars compared to five hundred and ninety seven million dollars in the prior year, which had reduced variable compensation payments related to the impact of the pandemic. As a percentage of revenue, our cash generation was strong at 15.7%. The DSO was 45 days compared to 44 days last year aligned with our targets. For the last 12 months, cash provided by operating activities was two billion dollars or sixteen point four percent of revenue. This represents eight dollars and two cents in cash per share. In the quarter, we invested two hundred and six million dollars in our build and buy profitable growth strategy, mainly in our IP and for the acquisition of CONI Case Management Consulting and RA. In addition, we use two hundred sixty seven million dollars to buy back our stock. Buying back CGI stock has been an accretive and flexible way to return capital to shareholders. As such, yesterday, our board of directors approved the extension of the NCIB program until February 2023, allowing us to purchase up to 18.8 million shares over the next 12 months. In addition, we reimburse two hundred and fifty million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter, leaving only fifty million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of fiscal twenty twenty two. With the issuance of our senior notes in September twenty twenty one, CGI's weighted average maturity is now four point nine years with a hundred percent fixed interest uh fixed interest rate at very favorable rates. Consistent with previous years, we review our capital allocation plan to formulate the most effective capital deployment strategy to maximize shareholder returns. In Qan, we delivered a return on invested capital of fifteen point three percent, a significant increase when compared to fifth twelve point four percent in the year ago period, returning to pre pandemic levels. Looking ahead, as and as indicated during our investor day this past November, our cash allocation priority remains the same. Investing in our business, pursuing accreditative acquisition and buying back our stock. With a net debt to capitalization ratio of twenty seven point eight percent at the end of December, as well as two point seven billion dollars of cash readily available and access to more if needed, CGI has the strength and capital resources to support our build and buy profitable growth strategy. Now I will turn the call to George to further discuss the insights and the first time. Thank you, Francois, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased with our team's strong first quarter financial performance. We started fiscal year 2022 with positive momentum in all key metrics, double-digit EPS accretion, accelerated revenue growth on a year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, robust bookings for the quarter and the last twelve months, and cash from operations of fifteen point seven percent for the quarter. The continued strength of our financial performance is grounded in our consultants' ability to earn clients' trust every day. This is evident in our modernization and digitization wins in the quarter. For example, Fannie Mae extended our long term partnership in the U.S. We're awarded new work to support their migration to the Pioneer in health and care and social services in Finland has expanded their relationship with CGI to assist in completing their Google cloud based transformation. This engagement aims to help optimize costs and increase business agility. The Quebec government selected CGI to help them establish and operate a new government cloud for the next three years. Upon completion, this cloud environment will be delivering services to multiple government agencies serving over eight million citizens. Electro Scandia, the Swedish electrical wholesaler, which is a company of Stonepar, the world's largest electrical products, systems, and services firm, named CGI as their digital transformation partner to support their modernization efforts, including the implementation of SAP S4HANA. The French Agency for Ecological Transition chose CGI to deliver application services, Agile at Scale, and DevOps to help modernize their technology capabilities and services supporting over three million businesses. And in the UK, the University of Nottingham awarded CGI a new consulting services agreement. Through this partnership, we will help modernize their digital value chain and supportive learning services for over forty five thousand students and seven thousand employees. Our robust bookings in the quarter were led by awards from government sector clients up twenty eight percent year over year for book the bill of one hundred and fifty one percent. We expect this uptick to continue given that governments around the world are reprioritizing their IT initiatives in line with the evolving public health and economic environment. On a sequential quarter basis, we also saw demand accelerate in the financial services sector, resulting in a nearly 40% increase in Q1 bookings and a book to bill of 114%. This was driven by client demand for digital services across all geographic segments. In addition to our strong performance, clients continue to recognize the depth and breadth of our knowledge and expertise, resulting in all-time high client satisfaction scores. Notably, our two highest client satisfaction scores measure how we partner with clients, specifically our level of commitment, collaboration, and communication. These qualities are key elements of the world-cslas delivery excellence for which CGI is known. In fact, client executives often raise these qualities as some of the most important priorities for their partner selection and cite them as differentiators for CGI. As a People Center firm, we also recognize that our success is founded on the strength of our consultants and professionals, 85% of whom are CGI shareholders. Our employee satisfaction scores also continue to be at record high levels. This is primarily due to our ongoing investments in digital tooling, health and well being, and employee development. These are critical elements to provide rapid career growth for our talented employees and are therefore instrumental to our overall employee retention. As such, our voluntary attrition rates remain below the IT services industry average. Now as Atlanta during our recent investor and market analyst day, client demand for end to end digitization remains the key driver for CGI's planned profitable growth in fiscal twenty twenty two and beyond. During that meeting, we shared four areas of investment with annual and three year objectives. First and foremost, in industry knowledge to help clients and their quest to build their right future. And technology expertise to support them in building it right. And offering intellectual property assets to enable them to build with speed. And finally, the operational excellence to help clients operate and evolve their planned future state. Today I will provide updates on each of these areas, starting with the right industry knowledge. We announced our plan to grow strategic business and IT consulting services revenue by 15 to 20 percent on a compound annual growth rate basis over the next three years. In the quarter, we saw an uptick in consulting and systems integration demand as bookings increased by over $100 million compared to this time last year. This is due in part to the expansion of our local consulting practices and the related increased investment in hiring and developing industry expertise. In fact, we are finalizing a new white paper which consolidates input from our board of directors, CGI industry experts, and external alliance partners to explore the key trends that will impact and shape the long-term trajectories of most global industries. Our consultants will be sharing this paper with our clients to help inform their strategic planning, and we will then discuss with clients how CGI can best support their business objectives. Our next area of investment, technology expertise, helps clients balance the potential of technology with the reality of complex enterprise delivery. We previously announced our fiscal twenty twenty two plan to increase employee training in digital technologies by 33%. A key mechanism for supporting this plan is CGI's online university, where 35% of employees completed courses in Q1. This training enables rapid reskilling and upskilling in areas of high demand, such as scaled agile and cloud technologies. Also, in support of our technical expertise investment, we plan to add over fifteen thousand employee certifications of global alliance partner solutions over the next three years. So far this year, we have already surpassed twenty one hundred of these certifications. This has contributed to a 15% increase in bookings with our global alliance partners on a year-over-year basis. Leveraging our investments in intellectual property, we also announced our plan to reach thirty percent of our revenue derived from IT by twenty twenty five. In the first quarter, IT services and solutions accounted for twenty two percent of revenue up from 21% last quarter. Our investments in IP globally are focused on deploying new value add capabilities across the existing IP portfolio, as well as investing to co-create with clients on new innovations to bring even greater value to clients' digital transformation and add to CGI's IP portfolio. Most importantly, our plans for operational excellence are a critical element our clients are looking for, not only for us to be a safe pair of hands, but also for us to deliver in a cost efficient manner. The three year plan we announce includes increasing headcount by fifteen percent on a three year compound annual growth rate basis across all of our global delivery centers, particularly in India. In Q one, our current hiring pays in India is almost two and a half times more than before the pandemic. This hiring contributed to the twenty percent year-over-year growth in our Asia-Pacific operations. Given CGI's strong value proposition, our attrition rate in India stands well below the India peer group average. Our ability to deliver these results is ensuring we have the right talent in both our client proximity and global delivery operations. Over the past few months, we have continued to evolve our hiring strategies to meet increasing client demand. In Q one, the number of new hires more than doubled compared to this time last year. We ended the quarter with 82,000 employees, a year-over-year net increase of 6,000 consultants and professionals. We continue to employ an effective and efficient talent attraction and onboarding approach, with two thirds of candidates coming directly to CGI, either through referrals from current employees or through direct applications for open positions on CGI.com. In addition, to support our proactive recruiting outreach, we have increased our recruiting capacity across all operating units. Our operational leaders, the same leaders who are responsible for client delivery are involved in candidate sourcing, assessment, and decision making at every step of our hiring process. This ensures tight alignment between candidate skills and client needs and reduces overall time to fill open fillable positions. So moving to the growth outlook for the rest of the year, we expect client demand for end-to-end digitization to continue accelerating across most of the key industries we serve. In government, as I stated earlier, we see positive client-demand momentum, particularly in areas well aligned to CGI's positioning and offerings. This includes helping agencies address a range of domestic priorities, spanning social and health services, infrastructure, space-based data solutions, environment and the climate, and cybersecurity. The manufacturing supply chain disruptions continue to require reshaping and reconfiguration. This is driving demand for data driven enterprises to improve service quality and generate new revenue streams through use of digital services, including AI and advanced analytics. In retail and consumer services, the permanent shift to more digital orders is requiring prioritization of omni-channel investments, while supply chain challenges are creating pressure on customer service and loyalty. Driving demand for AI and predictive analytics to improve forecasting, inventory management, and workforce planning. And in financial services, banks are aggressively implementing their digital transformation agendas to better understand their customers and improve organizational performance. Banking client initiatives now often include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. If not hinge on faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. And a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. Include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. That um decision um is that maybe a function of just you know the the M and the opportunities that you see as you think about the capital allocation for the upcoming year. Uh thanks, uh Thanos Francois. I'll take uh this one. Uh you're right. Uh you know and and that's uh what we indicated uh at the uh investor day, you know uh, we feel that you know the acquisition and M and A activities uh uh will be a lot more active this year. Uh we're talking uh about allocating a billion uh on on this and and uh we're on uh right path uh for now. So so uh and what we're seeing is that uh we we think that we'll be able to achieve uh this objective. So uh that's why we thought that again uh to wait uh uh again for for the dividend. Uh we as as indicated that we did uh we will renew our N C I B so uh uh you know if needed we will put some some investment in the uh in the share buyback but uh we think that uh uh you know versus this versus last year, uh a lot more in the MA side. Okay. Uh thank you, I'll pass the U.S. George can you just talk a little bit? You you touched in it in the comments on the IP solutions, but maybe talk about where you've been and and the journey of sort of globalizing more of the solutions. I know about a year ago this time you started down that path. Maybe give us an update on how you see things trending. Yep. No, that's uh it's a great question because uh you're right. We uh I call it our our unified approach to uh to growing IP. And uh it really is first and foremost about having process and methodology to propagate the existing IP across the entire uh channel of uh of CGI. So uh this is everything from approved value proposition through add ons to our existing IP, broader target market across industries, geographies and functions and and having a a more efficient and uh profitable uh delivery model. So just to give you a quick update, in the quarter, uh we do have over ten percent increase in the pipeline. We have an over ten percent increase in the deal size of the bookings that we have. So that's that gets to that uh improved value uh proposition and that broader uh delivery mechanism. And then we have an over ten percent increase in the win rate. So those are some nice early proof points that say that what we're doing around that propagation is uh is working. Uh in fact we have three of our SBUs that are at the thirty percent and uh and the two fastest growing are the ones that are under ten percent. So we have uh we have opportunity and uh and of course uh propagating that IP is the way to get there. Uh we're also making increased investments in the sourcing of the new IP. So this is uh everything from ideation with our industry experts, so that's uh that's showing some uh some signs of uh of opportunity, co-creating with clients. Sometimes we actually co-create and acquire the IP from our clients. Sometimes we actually just co-create and jointly own it and everything in between. That's where a lot of our best IPs actually came from. And so we uh we're doing that across uh the global CGI now. And then as I mentioned in the uh opening remarks, uh MA uh is is an area where we're gonna be looking at um uh IT services and solutions firms. Uh not just software only, but services and solutions firms. Uh we're opening up the uh the aperture to more of that in our MA. So uh you know early returns are are coming and uh and we're we're bullish on the future. Great. And then just the one final one for me, just around maybe more quarterly matters here, either you or Francois, could you talk about you mentioned client contract adjustments mainly in the UK and Australia, you mentioned a little bit in Scandinavia, but just you know, obviously this is always sort of a puts and takes, but where we are in the process of sort of running off um maybe those adjustments for those engagements and ramping other stuff. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, uh thanks. I'll I'll take it uh Paul. So so for for UK clearly it was uh you know uh one uh non recurring adjustment that uh had an impact on on their uh on their growth and contributions. So so that's behind us and and so you can expect uh to to to have a margin and and uh revenue picking up uh in the next uh few quarters in uh for UK. And and same thing for for uh in in the uh Scandinavia we we we have some some uh you know operational issue that we need to resolve in in Scandinavia, but we had also non recurring uh one time adjustment that uh uh are uh behind us and uh expecting that uh also there we'll see some some growth in the contribution. Perfect. Thank you. Financial, please go ahead. Hello, can you now Richard? Uh just uh wanted to get a bit of perspective in terms of the the operating level ofs the of the business, you know, compared to pre pandemic. Like are your utilization rates um kind of back to where they've been? Like try trying to get a bit of understanding on that. Yeah. Um actually uh our utilization rates are a little bit stronger than they were uh pre pandemic uh and and part of that is that uh that strong demand uh side that we see but also the opportunity we took uh right at the beginning of the uh pandemic to take the actions that we felt necessary. So uh we we measure the utilization on a weekly basis, uh obviously not just with reports, but in a call that I have with all the operating leaders. So uh we're very focused on it and I'm I'm pleased to to tell you that it's uh it's actually a little bit above where we were pre pandemic. Okay. And then um obviously you're in pretty constant contact with your accounts and clients. What are they saying about IT budgets um going into twenty twenty two? You know, particularly you know, how much higher they are or lower they are and kind of areas of priorities where they want to spend a Yeah, it's uh it's a good question. Obviously uh everybody's got s uh slightly different uh planning periods but uh in general uh in in areas like financial services, we see uh those budgets continuing to to go up and and across the board the focus is on both uh growing their revenue but uh and using technology to help do that and uh and and some client facing uh solutions in in their uh in their IT budgets but also focused on that operational efficiency. Uh we hear our clients uh talking about they have uh they're dealing with uh the current uh uh economic uh uh pricing pressures and and looking to make sure that they stay competitive through operational efficiencies. Technology, as you know, plays on both sides. It plays on the uh on the upside, on the revenue side, but technology also plays on the uh operational efficiency. So we we see a pretty strong environment for uh for IT and uh I've been talking for a while, Richard, this uh you know, this wasn't just pent up demand that we saw uh coming out of the the pandemic. It's it's it's something we think is sustainable from an IT perspective. Okay, and just one last quick one for me. Uh you know, on the acquisition side, uh you talked about opening up the aperture for technology. Historically, uh you guys have been more sort of value conscious and so when you look at you know technology type deals, no doubt the uh the valuations are certainly a bit more robust, uh, despite maybe the pullback here at the beginning of the year. So how how do you look at sort of the relative valuation you're kind of willing to pay for these and maybe give us a bit of perspective on on that? Yeah may maybe I'll I'll start and then I'll ask uh Francois to uh to continue. Just uh to remind you, uh we are looking to make these acquisitions accretive and so uh we're we're very conscious of not uh overpaying. Having said that, if the value is there, we're willing to pay higher multiples. So I don't know Francois And you know, where we're to a certain point conservative in our acquisition where we know we we're when're building our return we're building it uh a lot of times with with cost synergies. So for sure in IP we need to to be convinced that we will have revenue synergies and and so meaning uh expecting uh reven uh a lot more revenue increase coming from from these uh acquisitions. And and we have now the channel across the world to do it so for sure what we're looking at is IP that uh can be sold across the world, uh without no too much uh changes and and so for sure, you know, it will be valued a bit more, but uh we naturally with the return that we think we can enable we don't have any problem to to pay uh to pay the the right price. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from Paul Trevor from RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on uh you know CGI's growth relative to to the market in in peers and now maybe this isn't an apples to apples comparison, um but some of your peers have reported quite strong growths recently. I just wanted your thoughts on, you know, what's your view on CGI's growth, you know, just relative to those peers in in the market. And do you feel like you know you're matching, you're exceeding, um, or or lagging that the the growth of peers in the market Yeah, thanks for the question, uh Paul. Uh look, we we like where we are in our profitable revenue growth uh current landscape but also where we're where we're headed towards. Uh very, very proud of the fact that uh we've been able to take this uh growth that we are achieving both uh through the build and the buy and uh and drop that to earnings uh per share accretion double digits here in the first quarter. So we we like where we are on uh where we're getting that growth and uh and what the outlook is and you see that outlook based on the uh the strong book the bill again this quarter and for the trailing twelve months. So we we feel like we're in a very good um uh position to continue to uh accelerate our growth through both the build and the buy and uh and like I said our clients are rewarding us for that with uh new work and uh and also in uh in the scores, satisfaction scores they're giving us which translates to future new work. So uh we're we we feel like we're in a very good uh good place there. And just looking at you know the the growth uh in your employees uh offshore, so India, um you know, you mentioned that that's uh uh reflect of the demand that you're seeing. So you know, can you speak to like the the your clients? Are they you know increasingly prioritizing offshore versus what they did in the past. And what's the underlying driver of that? Is it is it cost? Is there is there something else that's that's driving it? Capabilities perhaps? No, I think uh I think uh for for a a lot of uh reasons. Th'eres some in uh some companies that hadn't gone to leveraging offshore and when the pandemic happened and everybody went remote, both uh both onshore and offshore, it it gave them a view that maybe some of that uh some of that could work. And so I think it's just some catch up by uh by some of those players. I I I'd add at the same time, uh given the pandemic, those that were heavily, heavily in offshore uh look to rebalance some of that. So but but on average, you know, if you're if you're rebalancing some of it versus you're going from zero to to something, uh the the the move to offshore is outweighing it. It's also that operational efficiency. There's uh there there are operational efficiencies uh to be gained in uh in in leveraging offshore and and of course that's uh given kind of what the outlook is for for cost, uh we see some of that. But you know, it's uh it's something that uh we'll continue to uh to leverage. Uh and and just to remind you, we're gonna stay true to our proximity model even as we leverage global delivery. Okay. Thank you. I'll pass on. Yep. Your next question comes from Stephanie Price from CIBC. Please go ahead. Good morning. Hi, Stephanie. Hi. Um, I was hoping that you could touch just on the percentage of bookings from new clients. It was very strong in the quarter. Just curious about what's driving the strength and if you've made any changes to the sales process Yeah, thanks, uh thanks Stephanie. Uh as I mentioned we have made investments on uh on the talent side and uh in both the technology uh reskilling, upskilling, and also the certifications, as I mentioned, on alliance partners. So that gives us another channel uh to uh to reach some of the the newer clients. Also, we're making investments on the uh industry expertise and the consulting skills. That's another new avenue for us to uh generate uh those new clients. So those are kind of two of the uh investments that uh that we've been making and will continue to make that's uh that's driving some of those uh those new client uh logos. Thanks. And then maybe one uh for Francois. Cash flow came in a little bit below street expectations in the quarter or in a little bit below prior year as a percentage of revenue. Just curious if you could talk about and put some tapes here and how we should be thinking about modeling cash flow for the rest of the year. Yeah. So thanks uh Stephanie for a question. Uh yeah, a as I indicated, you know, uh last year we had a very strong cash flow, close to six hundred million just in a quarter. And and really was the fact that last year because of COVID, you know, we had a lot less uh uh uh uh bonuses, uh year end bonuses to pay last year uh in the first quarter. So uh versus uh twenty twenty one where we had uh you know uh a way better year on on bonuses and that had an impact on the quarterization or the the cash coming from from the first quarter. We're still uh I'm still convinced that uh we'll be capable to generate uh you know the the right level of cash like last year and even perhaps a a bit uh better than last year. Uh so so uh you know it's it's just a timing uh on the cash side, but uh you know, still still pretty and you saw the DSO uh at forty five days and it's I think now it's the last five or six quarters uh that that we are at at our target of DSO so uh pretty uh uh pretty comfortable where we are with the cash generation. That's helpful colour. Thank you. And and your next question comes from Howard Long from Veritas. Please go ahead. George, you mentioned that um, you know, one of the ways you're developing IP and this has been for a while is to qu work with clients and just wanted to get a sense of what uh how how that's structured and how you share the costs. Um I know before, you know, you you did this a long time ago with with the big banks in Canada and now now as you're evolving and and working with more clients outside of Canada, how is that structure evolving as well? Thanks. Yeah, no, thanks for the for the question, Howard. It it really does uh uh vary. Um the the most uh the most typical uh opportunity though that we see is that the client uh actually provides some of the uh some of the industry uh expertise, obviously the use case, if you will, and uh and and of course then accelerates it through some of their uh quality assurance and and uh then piloting it. What they get from that is uh first mover status and uh and then of course we build some of those customizations and projectize it uh with CGI's investment and as a result they uh they get the long term maintenance benefits. So a lot of times it's really as simple as uh as that. And then they may pay us for some of the customizations directly and keep them outside of the product. And we're seeing that more and more. So there might be some uh some proprietary or specific elements that we decide up front would not go into the product, but they still get the leverage, kind of the platform nature of the product. That's that's typically the most uh the most uh uh used uh uh opportunity that we that we see. Others are but we've done the the other where we actually jointly put the money in and uh and then we we have a a royalty uh scheme that goes back to the the clients based on uh on new uh new wins and of course CGI in all cases owns the the rights to the uh to the IP but the uh but then the uh the client gets the the rights to to use it in uh in in a in a perpetuity. So that's uh that's typically how we uh we see those. We also see sometimes it's consortium. If it's a cost of doing business, which is kind of the opposite of uh first mover or proprietary nature of the of the business. It might be a cost, a regulatory cost of doing business, and everybody uh puts money in as equal partners, including CGI, but CGI uh runs, owns, and operates the IP for the consortium. So we see kind of um multiple models. And and that's pretty consistent across uh each of the geographies that we operate in. So that that that's a great explanation. Thanks for uh highlighting all the different structures. Um on the uh on on on the acquisitions, um just looking at um the revenue contribution, you know, from array and uh CMC and I know it's just one quarter, but um the the multiples, you know, uh they they look they look pretty good I guess compared to the the past acquisitions. Is there anything you'd like to call out there and um is it just you know maybe it's just uh acquisition specific or is there something about um the valuations um that you're seeing in in in um in the your uh targets? Yeah well valuations uh you know as we know over the last uh couple of years have uh have gone up and uh but we still are are interested in finding valuations that uh that we can make accretive to CGI in that first year and so uh yeah there you do see some of that. I would say though moving forward we're seeing valuations starting to favor EBITDA over growth. And uh I don't know if you're not gonna exactly Geor,ge. I think uh we we we saw a stabilization of of the uh of the valuation and and uh uh George is right, uh seeing a a bit more uh you know, concentration on on on the on the how much uh margin or e bit or e bit duh that uh the pat uh the company can bring in. So so uh uh yeah we are seeing a stabilization of it and so uh good opportunities uh for us. Well yeah that's uh that makes sense given uh I guess what's been going on in the market past few weeks. Exactly. Um yeah. Uh and then just maybe just one last one for Francois. Um just notice the uh in the quarter of PP and D spending you, know, ticking up. Um is that just kind of a return to normal, uh um, you know, tr uh investing again in physical facilities or could you just put a little more color to that? Yeah, yeah, I I I bet uh return to normal. You're you're totally right. Uh with with uh you know, people that uh start to come back uh to the offices, uh for for sure. We we started to do some some investment in in offices and all that, so so that's that's uh that's a part of it. And and some of it is also as as we know with with uh you know the supply chain in in some places that it's a little bit tougher we we can have some a bit of swing from from one quarter to the other uh with some of the delay. So so both of them. So yes, some of it is just uh you know um uh coming back to a normal investment level and some of it you can have some seasonality just uh because of the Okay, great. Next question comes from Kevin Kushneretney from Desjardins. Please go ahead. Yes, yep. Oh awesome. Perfect. Good morning. Um question for you, is there is there any sort of way to think about your your customer mix in terms of size? You know, sort of thinking about the split between enterprise, mid market, SMB. I'm wondering, you know, if maybe any recent change in focus, any opportunities or or ability to take a greater share of IT spend from smaller versus larger customers and just how do if that's the case, how would you think about the structure of your sales uh and consultant mix and the uh and the metro market strategy uh you know just to be aligned with how you're seeing the various uh and uh customer and markets. Yeah no thanks Kevin. Uh our our focus is primarily on enterprise uh clients. Uh we uh we feel that uh the value proposition that we can bring to them, the impact that we can have on them, uh particularly given our global footprint and our end to end services is in fact uh greatest and so that's really the the primary focus. In fact, if you look at uh some of those recent uh MA transactions, whether it's uh a Ray, DMC, and Unicode, they all have uh that same uh makeup of uh you know very large enterprise, at least one very large enterprise client that that generates uh a lot of their revenue. Um it does not mean that we do not uh take some of our IP and uh solutions to the uh to the medium sized business, not as much on the on the small side. And um but but it really uh the the primary focus is on uh is on enterprise and those uh those accounts that we can uh really again drive the uh the the highest value. And I I want to make sure you you recognize when we're talking about those metro markets, uh those metro markets are where those enterprise uh companies uh are are headquartered. It's not uh it's not uh looking at uh uh at metro markets where uh it's only uh going after a small or medium sized uh company. Very good. Thank thank you for that explanation. Uh maybe just one uh perhaps for for France Francois. Uh I know you don't disclose gross gross margin. Can you talk about trends there if you look year over year the split of manager IT versus consulting uh fifty fifty. It was fifty fifty a year ago as well. Um but what are you seeing on the on the sort of uh gross margin underlying trends um and how is that contributing to the uh to the e bit uh outperformance? Uh we we gross margin is is is very good uh and and improving since uh uh since uh last last year. Uh like uh uh George alluded before, uh utilization is very high, uh so that contributing to to to the to the gross uh margin. So uh no continue to be uh pretty uh pretty good on it and S DNA uh with with uh the the concentration the automation that we're pushing more and more uh and offshoring of some of the S GNA activities is also uh improving year over year and that's why you see uh the the E bit improvement. Super. Thanks very much. I'll uh I'll pass the line. Your next question comes from Daniel Chen from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Um good to see that you guys are still able to grow your team and your employee attrition rates are lower than the industry average. Any any color on why you're able to achieve this? Is it because you guys are paying Sure. Well I think the the the biggest uh reason for kind of where we uh where we're able to to to do that is our employee value proposition. Uh it includes significant stock ownership, the the 85%, uh the the investments we've been making in career development, the thirty three inc percentrease in training and development around reskilling, et cetera. These these are really some of the uh the the the reasons that uh that we have this, including our community involvement. Um it's really uh an attractor there. But but it goes one step further. We we recognize that we're in a uh a unique environment and so um we really focused on a few areas that uh to to keep that um not just the the the attrition down but also the attraction up. And uh and what we're doing on the attraction side is is really focused on who we recruit, uh where we recruit, and uh and how we recruit. And I think that's uh some of where you were talking about the who we recruit, uh higher concentration on college hires and also trainees that are coming from non traditional IT environments. So that's uh that's about twenty percent of our hires now. We have boot camps that then build the digital skills that they need. Where we recruit, yeah, yeah, proximity and uh and offshore, but also those onshore delivery centers. That's a better place to to recruit for us and uh and then a lower turnover rate. And we have thirty nine percent of our hires came from global delivery. And then it's how we recruit. Mentioned before that a third of our people come through employee referrals. Uh there are a stronger uh attraction to to C GI, but the people that refer them have a higher retention rate as well. Uh so we're really uh you know, we're really uh making sure that we invest to not just rest on the the employee value proposition that we have, but continue to uh to build in this uh current environment. Thanks for that, George. Uh as a follow up to that, given that twenty percent of your hires are from non traditional IT and uh from uh relatively junior members from college, would you say that the ramp up time for these employees might take a little bit longer than typical? Well though we do put them through uh we do th put them through boot camps, so there is uh a little bit of a ramp up and uh yet this is what we're doing today and you see that uh we're still able to uh to deliver the utilization and margins that you uh you see in our results in this quarter. And yet uh that's probably another lever as they uh as they come on board to uh to to increase uh the the utilization and margin going forward. Okay, that makes sense. Francois, you mentioned that you model um revenue synergies into your IP acquisitions where it's typically you've typically look to leverage uh value from cost energies. How about on the market, uh Metro market modeling side too? When you're looking at metro market acquisitions, are you also starting to model in revenue synergies given your view to bring in additional services uh as you make these acquisitions? Uh for sure. Especially, you know, uh when when uh we're we're investing in in uh metro markets where we're not necessarily there. Uh so most of the time it's because we want to buy uh relationships also and with clients and new clients and and so and that's what we did in the past in in some places. Uh so uh you know sometimes these uh smaller firms will have good relationship with with large clients, but not having the full capabilities that CGI has. And so by by coming and and and doing this merger, we are bringing the capabilities to to uh to this metro market and and with the relationship that we just uh bought, you know, we're capable to have some revenue synergies there. Great. Thank you. Julie, I think we've got time for one more question, please. Perfect. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hey guys, this is Cassie Channel for Jason. Good morning. Uh I'll just, you know, quickly slip into questions. So my first one I just wanted to ask. You guys obviously had pretty strong bookings this quarter. You know, I think it's the fourth quarter of like LTM book to build, you know, greater than one dot one. Can you just talk about, you know, very briefly like the core drivers of this and the potential sustainability. So like can we expect this trend to continue, you know, maybe at least for the next couple of quarters given the strong demand environment that you guys, you know, are able to capitalize on. Thanks. Sure. Um Kathy, one one of the uh areas I I already talked about some of the investments that we're making to uh to drive some of the uh the new clients uh particularly around the uh some of the the digital skills and the global alliances as well as the uh industry skills and uh some of the the consulting growth. So that's uh that's one of the areas that's driving that is that uh uh that mix of of new clients that are coming in. Certainly IP as we move to uh to IP uh thirty uh will give us uh an opportunity as we increase those deal size. I talk about some of the investments that we're making there to uh to to uh to drive that. And then the last is really the operational excellence, you know, the this uh drive to um uh to to efficiencies by our clients. Um and a lot of that uh requires automation and the that offshore mix. And what we're doing around our managed services offering is building modernization into the operational excellence platform. That's driving, again, longer-term, larger deals. So we do believe that in in this environment we'll be able to sustain a strong book to bill. Okay, awesome. And then, you know, one final question from me. I know you you guys have talked a lot about, you know, the consulting investments that you guys are making and you know during the analyst day you guys talked about that fifteen to twenty percent revenue cager over the medium term, you know, your UniCo acquisition um obviously bolsters your capabilities there as well. And while you don't really break apart bookings or revenues like by consulting, you know, per se, you know, can you share any metrics on, you know, perhaps like how book to build for consulting is trending or any other details there. Thanks guys. Yep. So uh we don't break that out uh now so I don't have that number in front of me but I can tell you just in general, about ten percent of our SINC is now um in the C uh in the consulting side. So uh we're we're looking at uh that's kind of the the basis of what we'd like to continue to grow. Okay, awesome. Thanks guys. Take care. Okay. Okay. Thanks everyone for participating.
