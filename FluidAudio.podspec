                       Fluid Audio is a Swift SDK for fully local, low-latency audio AI on Apple devices,
                       with inference offloaded to the Apple Neural Engine (ANE). The SDK includes
                       state-of-the-art speaker diarization, transcription, and voice activity detection
                       via open-source models that can be integrated with just a few lines of code.
