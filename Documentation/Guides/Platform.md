# Platform & Networking Notes

- CLI is available on macOS only. For iOS, use the library programmatically.
- Models auto-download on first use. If your network restricts Hugging Face access, set an HTTPS proxy: `export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890`.
- Windows alternative in development: [fluid-server](https://github.com/FluidInference/fluid-server)
