# TTS Benchmarks

Quantitative comparison of FluidAudio's TTS backends. Numbers come from
`fluidaudio tts-benchmark`, which is intended to make the
*latency-vs-efficiency-vs-quality* tradeoff visible without anyone having
to re-derive it from RTFx alone.

## Why not just RTFx?

RTFx (audio_seconds / synth_seconds) is a useful single number for batch
synthesis, but for conversational use it hides the things users actually
feel:

1. **Cold start** — first model load + ANE compile after install or
   reboot. On Apple Silicon the system's `anecompilerservice` can take
   ~20s on first invocation; subsequent loads finish in ~1s.
2. **TTFT (time-to-first-audio)** — for streaming agents the question is
   "how long until the user hears *something*", not "how long until the
   whole utterance is rendered". For one-shot backends in this slice
   `ttft_ms == synth_ms`; streaming-aware TTFT for PocketTTS / Magpie is
   a follow-up.
3. **Per-stage compute units** — Kokoro ANE / Magpie are pipelines of
   6–7 graphs. Sometimes ANE is *slower per call* but more efficient.
   The "right" compute-unit choice differs per stage.
4. **Memory footprint** — drives whether a backend is mobile-viable.
5. **Quality** — RTFx alone tells you nothing about whether the model
   pronounced "Reykjavík" or "$1,234.56" correctly. We measure WER + CER
   via Parakeet roundtrip on a fixed English corpus; non-English
   backends run with `--skip-asr` for now.

## Methodology

### Corpus

Four categories ship under `Benchmarks/tts/corpus/`:

| Name          | Phrases | Stress                                      |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| `prose-en`    | 20      | Harvard sentences (PB-balanced, IEEE 269)   |
| `numbers-en`  | 10      | Currencies, dates, phone numbers, time, units |
| `names-en`    | 10      | Proper nouns, acronyms, brands, jargon      |
| `prose-zh`    | 8       | Short Mandarin sentences (CosyVoice3, no WER) |

Lines beginning with `#` are comments. Custom corpora can be passed via
`--corpus-path <file.txt>`. CosyVoice3 defaults to `prose-zh`; everything
else defaults to `prose-en`.

### Metrics

Per phrase:
- `ttft_ms` — time-to-first-audio. For one-shot backends this equals
  `synth_ms`; streaming-aware TTFT for PocketTTS / Magpie is a follow-up.
- `synth_ms` — total synth wall time.
- `audio_ms` — generated audio duration.
- `rtfx` — `audio_ms / synth_ms`.
- `wer`, `cer` — via Parakeet ASR roundtrip on the rendered WAV.
- `stage_ms` — per-stage breakdown (backend-specific keys; empty for
  Kokoro / PocketTTS / CosyVoice3).
- Backend-specific extras: `encoder_tokens`, `acoustic_frames`,
  `chunk_count`, `frame_count`, `code_count`, `finished_on_eos`,
  `generated_token_count`, etc.

Aggregates:
- `cold_start_s` — `manager.initialize()` wall time. CosyVoice3 also
  includes voice-asset load.
- `first_synth_ms` — first synth call after init (still cold-ish).
- `ttft_ms_p50` / `ttft_ms_p95`.
- `warm_synth_ms_p50` / `warm_synth_ms_p95`.
- `agg_rtfx` — `Σ audio_ms / Σ synth_ms` across the corpus.
- `peak_rss_mb` — process-wide peak resident set, via
  `task_vm_info_data_t.resident_size_peak`.
- Per-category macro WER / CER.

### Compute-unit sweep

`--compute-units` selects how each stage is mapped to silicon:

| Preset         | Mapping                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | Backend's empirically-tuned per-stage layout         |
| `all-ane`      | Force every stage to `.cpuAndNeuralEngine`           |
| `cpu-and-gpu`  | Force every stage to `.cpuAndGPU`                    |
| `cpu-only`     | Force every stage to `.cpuOnly`                      |

Reporting all four for each backend exposes the latency-vs-efficiency
tradeoff. Caveats:

- **Kokoro ANE** has a per-stage compute-unit struct
  (`KokoroAneComputeUnits`) and honors all four presets natively.
- **Kokoro / Magpie / CosyVoice3** take a single `MLComputeUnits`; the
  preset maps via `TtsComputeUnitPreset.uniformUnits`.
- **PocketTTS** does not expose per-call compute-unit overrides — the
  preset is logged and ignored.

### Reproducibility

```bash
# From the package root.
swift run fluidaudio tts-benchmark \
  --backend kokoro-ane \
  --corpus prose-en \
  --voice af_heart \
  --compute-units default \
  --output-json bench.json \
  --audio-dir bench-wavs/
```

The harness writes a JSON report to `--output-json` and (optionally)
keeps WAVs under `--audio-dir`. Pass `--skip-asr` to drop the Parakeet
roundtrip. CosyVoice3 forces `--skip-asr`.

## Results

### Per-backend top-line

Reference machine: **MacBook Air, Apple M2 (2022), 8-core CPU /
8-core GPU / 16-core Neural Engine, 16 GB unified memory, macOS 26**
(`Mac14,2`, on AC). All runs use `--compute-units default`,
voice = backend default
(`af_heart` for Kokoro, `alba` for PocketTTS), corpus = `prose-en`,
Parakeet TDT roundtrip for WER / CER. Cold-start figures dominated by
ANE first-compile + on-disk model fetch the first time the cache misses.

Em-dash (`—`) marks backends that did not produce numbers on this run
(synthesis stub or upstream blocker).

Headline read: **Kokoro ANE wins on latency and RTFx** (~10× real-time,
244 ms p50 warm) at the cost of a noisier ASR roundtrip (WER 0.162 vs.
0.018 on the non-ANE Kokoro). **PocketTTS wins on quality** (perfect WER
on prose-en) but is the slowest at 0.97× RTFx and ~2.2 s p50 — i.e.
roughly real-time. **Plain Kokoro** is the latency-quality middle ground
(2.1× RTFx, WER 0.018).

### Kokoro ANE — compute-unit sweep

Only the `default` preset has been measured so far on the M2 reference
machine. The `all-ane` / `cpu-and-gpu` / `cpu-only` rows will be filled
in by re-running with `--compute-units <preset>`; cold-start should
dominate the differences because the ANE compile is per-preset.

| Preset         | Cold start (s) | Warm synth p50 (ms) | Warm synth p95 (ms) | Agg RTFx | Peak RSS (MB) |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| `default`      | 35.1           | 244                 | 305                 | 10.41    | 823            |
| `all-ane`      | TBD            | TBD                 | TBD                 | TBD      | TBD            |
| `cpu-and-gpu`  | TBD            | TBD                 | TBD                 | TBD      | TBD            |
| `cpu-only`     | TBD            | TBD                 | TBD                 | TBD      | TBD            |

### Kokoro ANE — per-stage breakdown (default preset)

Means across 20 prose-en phrases on M2. Stages map to the 7-CoreML-graph
split documented in [KokoroAne.md](KokoroAne.md). Vocoder + noise
together account for ~80% of synth time, which is the natural target
for any further per-stage compute-unit re-tuning.

| Stage        | Mean ms | % of total |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| `albert`     | 9.0     | 3.7%       |
| `post_albert`| 4.1     | 1.7%       |
| `alignment`  | 1.2     | 0.5%       |
| `prosody`    | 27.1    | 11.3%      |
| `noise`      | 77.0    | 32.1%      |
| `vocoder`    | 114.2   | 47.6%      |
| `tail`       | 7.5     | 3.1%       |
| **total**    | 240.2   | 100%       |

### Magpie — per-stage breakdown (default preset)

Not measured (upstream blocker, see
[Backends not yet measured](#backends-not-yet-measured)). When that's
resolved the harness will populate this table from
`MagpieSynthesisTimings`:

| Stage          | Mean ms | % of total |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| `text_encoder` | TBD     | TBD        |
| `prefill`      | TBD     | TBD        |
| `ar_loop`      | TBD     | TBD        |
| `decoder_step` | TBD     | TBD        |
| `sampler`      | TBD     | TBD        |
| `nanocodec`    | TBD     | TBD        |
| **total**      | TBD     | 100%       |

## Backends not yet measured

Three backends are wired into `tts-benchmark` but didn't produce
numbers on the M2 reference machine. Each is blocked upstream of the
benchmark harness — fixing the harness will not change anything.

### StyleTTS2

**Blocker:** synthesis is a stub upstream. `StyleTTS2Synthesizer`
throws `"not yet implemented"` rather than returning audio. The
benchmark harness intentionally does not register a driver for it.

**What unblocks:** finishing the StyleTTS2 4-stage pipeline integration
(see PR #554 / `Documentation/TTS/StyleTTS2.md`). Once `synthesize` returns
audio, add a `runStyleTts2(...)` driver mirroring the Kokoro / PocketTTS
pattern in `Sources/FluidAudioCLI/Commands/TtsBenchmarkCommand.swift`.

### Magpie

**Blocker:** the `decoder_step.mlmodelc` model is missing `MultiArray`
constraints on its KV-output features, so CoreML rejects the
`MLPredictionOptions.outputBackings` map that
`MagpieSynthesizer.runDecoderStep` constructs:

```
Output feature (null) doesn't support output backing because it
doesn't have a MultiArray constraints.
```

The first warmup error is logged as non-fatal at
`MagpieTtsManager.swift:99-104`, but the same error re-raises on the
first real `synthesize` call. `MagpieCommand` (`fluidaudio magpie text …`)
shares the same code path and is expected to fail identically — this is
not a benchmark-harness regression.

**What unblocks (cheapest first):**

1. **Fall back to the slow path on output-backing failure.**
   `MagpieKvCache.absorbOutputs(_:)` already exists (and is documented
   as the fallback for "if a future macOS revision rejects our buffer
   layout"); it's just never called. Wrap the
   `model.prediction(from:options:)` call in
   `MagpieSynthesizer.swift:775-778` with a try/catch that retries
   without `outputBackings` and routes outputs through
   `absorbOutputs(_:)`. Costs ~18.9 MB of fresh allocation per
   `decoder_step` call but produces measurable numbers.
2. **Re-export `decoder_step.mlmodelc`** from the Python conversion
   pipeline (`mobius/models/tts/magpie/coreml/...`) with explicit
   `MultiArray` shape + dtype constraints on `new_k_*`, `new_v_*`,
   `var_*` outputs.

### CosyVoice3

**Blocker:** `CosyVoice3ModelStore` resolves
`LLM-Decode-M768-fp16-stateful.mlmodelc` (per
`ModelNames.swift:619` and `CosyVoice3Constants.swift:69`), but
the public HuggingFace repo
[`FluidInference/CosyVoice3-0.5B-coreml`](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/CosyVoice3-0.5B-coreml)
only ships the non-stateful `LLM-Decode-M768-fp16.mlmodelc`. The
stateful KV-cache variant has not been uploaded, so
`CosyVoice3ResourceDownloader.ensureCoreModels()` succeeds but leaves
the cache without the file the loader actually expects, surfacing as:

```
modelNotFound(path: "LLM-Decode-M768-fp16-stateful.mlmodelc")
```

**What unblocks:** publish the stateful LLM-Decode variant to the HF
repo (the same conversion that introduced the `MLState` /
macOS 15+ requirement at `CosyVoice3TtsManager.swift:41-45`). No code
change needed on the benchmark side; the driver in
`runCosyVoice3(...)` is wired and waiting.

### Per-category quality

MacBook Air M2 (2022), default compute-units, Parakeet TDT roundtrip. p50 / p95 are
warm-synth latency in ms. Numbers + names corpora exercise edge cases
the ASR roundtrip is genuinely sensitive to (currency normalization,
acronyms, brand spelling), so the WER spike there reflects real
end-to-end pronunciation quality rather than ASR artefacts.

**Kokoro ANE (default preset)**

| Corpus       | Phrases | Macro WER | Macro CER | Synth p50 (ms) | Synth p95 (ms) | RTFx   |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|

| `names-en`   | 10      | 0.394     | 0.136     | 1033            | 1927            | 4.38×  |

**Kokoro (single-CU)**

| Corpus       | Phrases | Macro WER | Macro CER | Synth p50 (ms) | Synth p95 (ms) | RTFx   |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `prose-en`   | 20      | 0.018     | 0.007     | 1263            | 1497            | 2.11×  |
| `numbers-en` | 10      | 0.173     | 0.091     | 3587            | 3711            | 1.58×  |
| `names-en`   | 10      | 0.234     | 0.081     | 3934            | 5667            | 1.26×  |

**PocketTTS**

| Corpus       | Phrases | Macro WER | Macro CER | Synth p50 (ms) | Synth p95 (ms) | RTFx   |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `prose-en`   | 20      | 0.000     | 0.000     | 2222            | 3281            | 0.97×  |
| `numbers-en` | 10      | 0.363     | 0.130     | 3174            | 5340            | 1.35×  |
| `names-en`   | 10      | 0.178     | 0.035     | 3537            | 6430            | 1.23×  |

The qualitative pattern: Kokoro ANE pays a noticeable WER tax on prose
versus the non-ANE Kokoro graph, but stays >4× real-time on the
hard corpora where Kokoro itself drops to 1.3–1.6× and PocketTTS to
1.2–1.4×. PocketTTS is the only backend that hits 0.000 WER on prose,
but its `numbers-en` WER is the worst of the three because of how it
normalises currency / phone numbers.

Numbers above are illustrative; the actual reference values are written
the first time the harness is run and committed.

## How to add or improve a backend

Each driver is ~70 lines and lives in `Sources/FluidAudioCLI/Commands/TtsBenchmarkCommand.swift`:

1. Implement `runX(...)` that mirrors the existing pattern: build the
   manager with the requested compute units, time `initialize()`, run a
   single warm-up synth, then call `runPhraseLoop` with a closure that
   returns `BackendPhraseSample`.
2. If the backend has its own per-stage compute-units struct, add an
   `init(preset: TtsComputeUnitPreset)` mirroring
   `KokoroAneComputeUnits.init(preset:)`.
3. Add the backend's case to the `Backend` enum and the `parseBackend`
   dispatch.
4. Re-run on the reference machine and replace the placeholder row in
   the **Per-backend top-line** table above.

Streaming-aware TTFT (using `synthesizeStreaming` for PocketTTS and
`synthesizeStream` for Magpie) is a follow-up — current TTFT == total
synth time for one-shot drivers.
